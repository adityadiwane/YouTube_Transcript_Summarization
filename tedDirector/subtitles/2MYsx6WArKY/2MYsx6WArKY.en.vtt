00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I have a question for you:

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Are you religious?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Please raise your hand right now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
if you think of yourself as a religious person.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
(Laughter)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Okay, here's another question:

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Do you think of yourself as spiritual

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Okay, that's the majority.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
My Talk today

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
why most people consider themselves

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
My Talk today is about self-transcendence.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It's just a basic fact about being human

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And when that happens,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
the feeling is ecstatic

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and we reach for metaphors of up and down

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to explain these feelings.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
We talk about being uplifted

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
or elevated.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
without a good concrete metaphor.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
most of which we're very familiar with.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
from out of nowhere

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and it opens onto a staircase.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
We climb the staircase

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and experience a state of altered consciousness.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
In 1902,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
the great American psychologist William James

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
He collected all kinds of case studies.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
He quoted the words of all kinds of people

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
who'd had a variety of these experiences.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
One of the most exciting to me

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
is this young man, Stephen Bradley,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And here's what Bradley said about it.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
(Music)

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
for about one second in the room,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
with arms extended,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
appearing to say to me, "Come."

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The next day I rejoiced with trembling.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
This world had no place in my affections.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Previous to this time,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I was very selfish and self-righteous.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and could, with a feeling heart,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
forgive my worst enemies.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
JH: So note

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
how Bradley's petty, moralistic self

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
just dies on the way up the staircase.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And on this higher level

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
he becomes loving and forgiving.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
The world's many religions have found so many ways

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
to help people climb the staircase.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Some shut down the self using meditation.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Others use psychedelic drugs.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.260
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Others use dancing, spinning and circling

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
to promote self-transcendence.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Others overcome their self at raves.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
But here's the weirdest place of all:

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
war.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So many books about war say the same thing,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that nothing brings people together

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
like war.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I'm going to play for you an excerpt

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
from this book by Glenn Gray.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and wrote about the experience of men in battle.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Here's a key passage

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
where he basically describes the staircase.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
that the experience of communal effort in battle

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
has been the high point of their lives.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
"I" passes insensibly into a "we,"

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
"my" becomes "our"

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and individual faith

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
loses its central importance.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
I believe that it is nothing less

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
than the assurance of immortality

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
that makes self-sacrifice at these moments

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
so relatively easy.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I may fall, but I do not die,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
for that which is real in me goes forward

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and lives on in the comrades

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
for whom I gave up my life.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
JH: So what all of these cases have in common

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and it feels good, it feels really good,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
It feels somehow uplifting.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
This idea that we move up was central in the writing

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
or two-level man.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
The lower level he called the level of the profane.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
It just means ordinary or common.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
We want to satisfy our individual desires.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
We pursue our individual goals.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
But sometimes something happens

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
that triggers a phase change.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Individuals unite

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
into a team, a movement or a nation,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
which is far more than the sum of its parts.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
because he believed that the function of religion

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
was to unite people into a group,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
into a moral community.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
takes on an air of sacredness.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And once people circle around

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
some sacred object or value,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Durkheim wrote

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
about a set of intense collective emotions

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
of making a group out of individuals.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Think of the collective joy in Britain

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
on the day World War II ended.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
which brought down a dictator.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And think of the collective grief

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
in the United States

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that we all felt, that brought us all together,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
after 9/11.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So let me summarize where we are.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
is just a basic part of being human.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I'm offering the metaphor

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of a staircase in the mind.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I'm saying we are Homo duplex

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and this staircase takes us up from the profane level

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
to the level of the sacred.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
When we climb that staircase,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
self-interest fades away,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
we become just much less self-interested,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and we feel as though we are better, nobler

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and somehow uplifted.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So here's the million-dollar question

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
for social scientists like me:

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Is the staircase

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
a feature of our evolutionary design?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Is it a product of natural selection,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
like our hands?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system --

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
this religious stuff is just something

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
that happens when the wires cross in the brain --

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
it's just a mistake?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
The New Atheists, for example,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
argue that religion is a set of memes,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
sort of parasitic memes,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
that get inside our minds

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And after all,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
how could it ever be good for us

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to lose ourselves?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
How could it ever be adaptive

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
for any organism

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
to overcome self-interest?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Well let me show you.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
In "The Descent of Man,"

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Charles Darwin wrote a great deal

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
about the evolution of morality --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
where did it come from, why do we have it.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Darwin noted that many of our virtues

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
are of very little use to ourselves,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
but they're of great use to our groups.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
He wrote about the scenario

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
in which two tribes of early humans

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
would have come in contact and competition.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
He said, "If the one tribe included

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
a great number of courageous, sympathetic

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and faithful members

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
who are always ready to aid and defend each other,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
this tribe would succeed better

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and conquer the other."

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
will not cohere,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and without coherence

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
nothing can be effected."

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
In other words,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Charles Darwin believed

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
in group selection.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
but it's about to make a major comeback this year,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
making a very strong case

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
that we, and several other species,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
are products of group selection.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
But really the way to think about this

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
is as multilevel selection.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
So look at it this way:

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Within this team

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
there's competition.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
There are guys competing with each other.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
So within the team,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
their interests are actually pitted against each other.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And sometimes it would be advantageous

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
for one of these guys

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
to try to sabotage the other guys.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
to the coach.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But while that competition is going on

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
within the boat,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
this competition is going on across boats.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
now they've got no choice but to cooperate

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
because they're all in the same boat.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
They can only win

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
if they all pull together as a team.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
I mean, these things sound trite,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
but they are deep evolutionary truths.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
The main argument against group selection

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
has always been

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
they're just going to get taken over by free-riders,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Let me illustrate this for you.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms --

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
they work together, they generate wealth.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And as you'll see in this simulation,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
But suppose then that one of them mutates.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
There's a mutation in the gene

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It takes advantage of the others.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And so when a green interacts with a blue,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
So here's how things play out.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
We start with just one green,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
and as it interacts

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
it gains wealth or points or food.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
The free-riders have taken over.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and group selection cannot get started.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
It's not that hard a problem.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And nature's favorite solution

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
is to put everyone in the same boat.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
For example,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
why is it that the mitochondria in every cell

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
has its own DNA,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
It's because they used to be

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
separate free-living bacteria

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and they came together

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and became a superorganism.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
but once they got a membrane around them,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
they were all in the same membrane,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
now all the wealth-created division of labor,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
all the greatness created by cooperation,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
stays locked inside the membrane

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and we've got a superorganism.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And now let's rerun the simulation

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
putting one of these superorganisms

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and look what happens.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
It's so big and powerful and efficient

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
that it can take resources

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.260
from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And pretty soon the whole population

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
is actually composed of these new superorganisms.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
What I've shown you here

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
is sometimes called a major transition

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
in evolutionary history.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Darwin's laws don't change,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
but now there's a new kind of player on the field

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and things begin to look very different.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
that just happened with some bacteria.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
It happened again

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
about 120 or a 140 million years ago

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
when some solitary wasps

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
began creating little simple, primitive

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
nests, or hives.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
they had no choice but to cooperate,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
because pretty soon they were locked into competition

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
with other hives.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And the most cohesive hives won,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
just as Darwin said.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
These early wasps

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
gave rise to the bees and the ants

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
that have covered the world

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and changed the biosphere.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And it happened again,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
even more spectacularly,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
in the last half-million years

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
when our own ancestors

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
became cultural creatures,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
they came together around a hearth or a campfire,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
they divided labor,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and eventually they worshiped their own gods.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Once they were all in the same tribe,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And they unlocked the most powerful force

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
ever known on this planet,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
which is human cooperation --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
a force for construction

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and destruction.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
as beehives.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
but they tend to then break apart.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
In fact, often,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.260
often those divisions are along religious lines.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Nonetheless, when people do come together

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and put themselves all into the same movement,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
they can move mountains.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Do you think they're there

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
pursuing their self-interest?

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Or are they pursuing communal interest,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
which requires them to lose themselves

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and become simply a part of a whole?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Okay, so that was my Talk

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
delivered in the standard TED way.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in three minutes

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
in a more full-spectrum sort of way.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
(Music)

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
of religious experience,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
as William James explained.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and losing ourselves.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
The staircase takes us

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
from the experience of life as profane or ordinary

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
upwards to the experience of life as sacred,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
or deeply interconnected.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
We are Homo duplex,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
as Durkheim explained.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And we are Homo duplex

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
because we evolved by multilevel selection,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
as Darwin explained.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
rather than a bug,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
but if it is an adaptation,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
then the implications are profound.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
If it is an adaptation,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
then we evolved to be religious.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
I don't mean that we evolved

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
to join gigantic organized religions.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Those things came along too recently.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
I mean that we evolved

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
to see sacredness all around us

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and to join with others into teams

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
and circle around sacred objects,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
people and ideas.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
This is why politics is so tribal.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
but politics is also about sacredness.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
It's about joining with others

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
to pursue moral ideas.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and we all believe we're on the good team.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And most importantly,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
if the staircase is real,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
it explains the persistent undercurrent

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
of dissatisfaction in modern life.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Because human beings are, to some extent,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
hivish creatures like bees.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
We broke down the old institutions

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
and brought liberty to the oppressed.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and generated vast wealth and comfort.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Nowadays we fly around

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
like individual bees exulting in our freedom.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
But sometimes we wonder:

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Is this all there is?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
What should I do with my life?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
What's missing?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
What's missing is that we are Homo duplex,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
but modern, secular society was built

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
to satisfy our lower, profane selves.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
One great challenge of modern life

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
is to find the staircase amid all the clutter

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
and then to do something good and noble

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
once you climb to the top.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
They all want to find a cause or calling

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
that they can throw themselves into.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
They're all searching for their staircase.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
And that gives me hope

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
because people are not purely selfish.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
Most people long to overcome pettiness

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and become part of something larger.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
And this explains the extraordinary resonance

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
of this simple metaphor

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
conjured up nearly 400 years ago.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
"No man is an island

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
entire of itself.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
Every man is a piece of the continent,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
a part of the main."

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
JH: Thank you.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:10.260
(Applause)
