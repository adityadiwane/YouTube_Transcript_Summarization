00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:17.760
I'd like to talk about my dad.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.336
My dad has Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:23.896
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:27.283
and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:31.608
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:35.496
he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:39.360
or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.872
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:46.400
and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.537
My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:59.186
and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:01.336
That's a lot of people.

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:07.952
Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,

00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:11.800
the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.545
And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:21.000
We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.633
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:29.449
and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:35.200
I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.760
Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.080
I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.984
that's what the research says you should do.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:53.472
But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.984
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:59.424
That's what happened with my dad.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:05.272
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.

00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:09.247
(Laughter)

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:11.396
He got dementia anyway.

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.833
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:19.593
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:23.342
So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:25.296
Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father,

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:30.544
and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:36.536
I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:43.335
and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:49.024
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.

00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:53.160
You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.448
It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:00.072
And reading is just about impossible.

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:03.528
When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:09.032
they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:13.544
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:19.049
He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.704
He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:26.079
he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.072
But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:35.568
I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:39.824
Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.928
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:47.128
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:52.434
I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.

00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:58.056
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.203
(Laughter)

00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:07.285
And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.

00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:11.928
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:15.417
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:20.410
the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.020
They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.912
easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:32.424
That all seems like win to me.

00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:35.447
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.

00:04:35.447 --> 00:04:39.968
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:44.242
as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:49.799
you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:52.384
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.824
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.

00:04:55.824 --> 00:05:00.485
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:02.467
I'll still be able to be mobile.

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:06.409
I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.538
so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.

00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:16.139
Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.906
My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:25.786
I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,

00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:30.266
but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.977
he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.

00:05:33.977 --> 00:05:38.682
And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.066
even when it's so hard.

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:43.369
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.658
his naked heart still shines.

00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:49.577
I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:52.625
And what I need now is to learn to be like that.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:58.098
I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.

00:05:58.098 --> 00:06:00.617
I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:04.481
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.

00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:07.931
But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.

00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:09.681
Thank you.

00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:18.601
(Applause)
