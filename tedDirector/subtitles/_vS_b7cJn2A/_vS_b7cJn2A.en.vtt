00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.731
Some years ago,

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:17.175
I stumbled across a simple design exercise

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.780
that helps people understand
and solve complex problems,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.867
and like many of these design exercises,
it kind of seems trivial at first,

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:26.611
but under deep inspection,

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.331
it turns out that it reveals
unexpected truths

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:32.662
about the way that we collaborate
and make sense of things.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.264
The exercise has three parts

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.749
and begins with something
that we all know how to do,

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.149
which is how to make toast.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.809
It begins with a clean sheet of paper,
a felt marker,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.940
and without using any words,
you begin to draw how to make toast.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.118
And most people draw something like this.

00:00:49.118 --> 00:00:52.498
They draw a loaf of bread, 
which is sliced, then put into a toaster.

00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:54.744
The toast is then deposited for some time.

00:00:54.744 --> 00:01:00.295
It pops up, and then voila!
After two minutes, toast and happiness.

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:05.643
Now, over the years, I've collected
many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:07.403
and some of them are very good,

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:10.869
because they really illustrate
the toast-making process quite clearly.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.166
And then there are some that are,
well, not so good.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:19.344
They really suck, actually, because
you don't know what they're trying to say.

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:21.271
Under close inspection,

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:24.754
some reveal some aspects of toast-making
while hiding others.

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:27.424
So there's some
that are all about the toast,

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:30.164
and all about the transformation of toast.

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:32.764
And there's others
that are all about the toaster,

00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:36.094
and the engineers love to draw
the mechanics of this.

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:37.504
(Laughter)

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:39.875
And then there are others
that are about people.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.723
It's about visualizing
the experience that people have.

00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:47.236
And then there are others that are about
the supply chain of making toast

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.226
that goes all the way back to the store.

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.663
It goes through the supply chain
networks of teleportation

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:55.890
and all the way back
to the field and wheat,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.700
and one all actually goes
all the way back to the Big Bang.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.904
So it's crazy stuff.

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:02.757
But I think it's obvious

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:06.263
that even though these drawings
are really wildly different,

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:09.366
they share a common quality,
and I'm wondering if you can see it.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.743
Do you see it? What's common about these?

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:15.118
Most drawings have nodes and links.

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:20.468
So nodes represent the tangible objects
like the toaster and people,

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:23.974
and links represent
the connections between the nodes.

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:26.807
And it's the combination
of links and nodes

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:28.920
that produces a full systems model,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.845
and it makes our private
mental models visible

00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:34.878
about how we think something works.

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:36.709
So that's the value of these things.

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.817
What's interesting about
these systems models

00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:41.002
is how they reveal
our various points of view.

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.623
So for example, Americans
make toast with a toaster.

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:46.144
That seems obvious.

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:50.114
Whereas many Europeans
make toast with a frying pan, of course,

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:54.391
and many students make toast with a fire.

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.610
I don't really understand this.
A lot of MBA students do this.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.375
So you can measure the complexity
by counting the number of nodes,

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:05.297
and the average illustration
has between four and eight nodes.

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:08.292
Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.545
but it's quick to understand,

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:15.618
and more than 13, the drawing
produces a feeling of map shock.

00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:17.121
It's too complex.

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:19.664
So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:22.294
So if you want to communicate
something visually,

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:26.021
have between five and 13 nodes
in your diagram.

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.725
So though we may not
be skilled at drawing,

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.856
the point is that we intuitively know
how to break down complex things

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:36.116
into simple things and then 
bring them back together again.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.337
So this brings us to our second part of 
the exercise,

00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:40.913
which is how to make toast,

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:43.713
but now with sticky notes
or with cards.

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:45.141
So what happens then?

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:49.462
Well, with cards, most people
tend to draw clear, more detailed,

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.740
and more logical nodes.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.317
You can see the step by step
analysis that takes place,

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:58.549
and as they build up their model,
they move their nodes around,

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.129
rearranging them like Lego blocks.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.184
Now, though this might seem trivial,
it's actually really important.

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:09.912
This rapid iteration of expressing
and then reflecting and analyzing

00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:13.263
is really the only way
in which we get clarity.

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:15.911
It's the essence of the design process.

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.620
And systems theorists do tell us

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.182
that the ease with which
we can change a representation

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:24.767
correlates to our willingness
to improve the model.

00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:29.239
So sticky note systems
are not only more fluid,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:33.279
they generally produce
way more nodes than static drawings.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.010
The drawings are much richer.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.575
And this brings us
to our third part of the exercise,

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:41.509
which is to draw how to make toast,
but this time in a group.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.271
So what happens then?

00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.883
Well, here's what happens.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:48.500
It starts out messy,
and then it gets really messy,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.125
and then it gets messier,

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.052
but as people refine the models,

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:54.583
the best nodes become more prominent,

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:57.160
and with each iteration,
the model becomes clearer

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.434
because people build
on top of each other's ideas.

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:03.917
What emerges is a unified systems model

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:08.057
that integrates the diversity
of everyone's individual points of view,

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:09.977
so that's a really different outcome

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.648
from what usually happens 
in meetings, isn't it?

00:05:12.648 --> 00:05:15.620
So these drawings can contain
20 or more nodes,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.849
but participants don't feel map shock

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.074
because they participate in the building
of their models themselves.

00:05:22.074 --> 00:05:25.395
Now, what's also really interesting,
that the groups spontaneously mix

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:28.854
and add additional layers
of organization to it.

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:30.864
To deal with contradictions, for example,

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.684
they add branching patterns
and parallel patterns.

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.907
Oh, and by the way,
if they do it in complete silence,

00:05:36.907 --> 00:05:39.663
they do it much better
and much more quickly.

00:05:39.663 --> 00:05:42.205
Really interesting --
talking gets in the way.

00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:45.897
So here's some key lessons
that can emerge from this.

00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:48.476
First, drawing helps us
understand the situations

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:51.748
as systems with nodes
and their relationships.

00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:55.388
Movable cards produce
better systems models,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.118
because we iterate much more fluidly.

00:05:58.118 --> 00:06:01.332
And then the group notes produce 
the most comprehensive models

00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:04.689
because we synthesize
several points of view.

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.275
So that's interesting.

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:09.581
When people work together
under the right circumstances,

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:12.692
group models are much better
than individual models.

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:17.639
So this approach works really great
for drawing how to make toast,

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.528
but what if you wanted to draw
something more relevant or pressing,

00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:26.636
like your organizational vision,
or customer experience,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.940
or long-term sustainability?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.446
There's a visual revolution
that's taking place

00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:35.859
as more organizations
are addressing their wicked problems

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.645
by collaboratively drawing them out.

00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:43.267
And I'm convinced that those who see
their world as movable nodes and links

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.391
really have an edge.

00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:47.469
And the practice is really pretty simple.

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.371
You start with a question,
you collect the nodes,

00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:53.459
you refine the nodes,
you do it over again,

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:58.768
you refine and refine and refine,
and the patterns emerge,

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:03.120
and the group gets clarity
and you answer the question.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.112
So this simple act of visualizing
and doing over and over again

00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:13.694
produces some really remarkable outcomes.

00:07:13.694 --> 00:07:15.581
What's really important to know

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:19.271
is that it's the conversations
that are the important aspects,

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.596
not just the models themselves.

00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:23.384
And these visual frames of reference

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:27.982
can grow to several hundreds
or even thousands of nodes.

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:31.000
So, one example is from
an organization called Rodale.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.486
Big publishing company.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.622
They lost a bunch of money one year,

00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:38.964
and their executive team for three days
visualized their entire practice.

00:07:38.964 --> 00:07:44.886
And what's interesting is that
after visualizing the entire business,

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:46.650
systems upon systems,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.716
they reclaimed 
50 million dollars of revenue,

00:07:49.716 --> 00:07:54.734
and they also moved from a D rating 
to an A rating from their customers.

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:58.329
Why? Because there's
alignment from the executive team.

00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:01.742
So I'm now on a mission
to help organizations

00:08:01.742 --> 00:08:06.456
solve their wicked problems
by using collaborative visualization,

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:09.474
and on a site that I've produced
called drawtoast.com,

00:08:09.474 --> 00:08:12.678
I've collected a bunch of best practices.

00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:15.441
and so you can learn
how to run a workshop here,

00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.584
you can learn more about
the visual language

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:22.500
and the structure of links and nodes that
you can apply to general problem-solving,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.705
and download examples of various templates

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:30.998
for unpacking the thorny problems
that we all face in our organizations.

00:08:30.998 --> 00:08:34.620
So the seemingly trivial
design exercise of drawing toast

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.661
helps us get clear, engaged and aligned.

00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:41.609
So next time you're confronted
with an interesting challenge,

00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:43.943
remember what design has to teach us.

00:08:43.943 --> 00:08:47.774
Make your ideas visible,
tangible, and consequential.

00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:50.932
It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:54.082
and I believe it's an idea
worth celebrating.

00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:55.902
Thank you.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:09:00.382
(Applause)
