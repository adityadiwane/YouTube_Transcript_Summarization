00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580
I'd like to introduce you to my mom.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.716
(Laughter)

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.836
I'm guessing that's not what you expected,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.836
and it's not what I expected either,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.316
and thank goodness I realized
that an Asian man was not my mom

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.436
before I hugged him,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.180
because that would have been so awkward.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.676
Recognizing people
isn't one of my strengths

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.555
due to a genetic visual impairment
that has no correction or cure.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.516
As a result, I am legally blind,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.236
though I prefer "partially sighted"
because it's more optimistic.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.876
(Laughter)

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.740
And I'm entitled to the label "disabled."

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.820
I hate the word disabled
when it's used to describe people.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.380
It detonates a mindset of less than

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.076
that utterly disregards capacity,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.940
ability, potential,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.860
instead prioritizing brokenness

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.820
and lack.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.580
The perspective can be overt.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.260
What can't he do for himself
that I'm going to have to do for him?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.556
She'll probably need some accommodation

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.220
that no other employee
at this business needs.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020
Sometimes, the hidden bias

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.660
is so sweetly conveyed.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.060
"Wow, Susan,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.500
look at everything you've done
in your career and your life.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.676
How did you do all of that
and be visually impaired?"

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.276
(Laughter)

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.116
I fail at being disabled.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.516
(Laughter)

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.876
So in the spirit of incentivizing
the rampant failure

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.196
of people all over the world

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.756
and enticing the so-called normal
to just give it a rest already,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.716
here are five tips

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.780
to fail at being disabled.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.356
Tip one:

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.859
know your superpowers.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.236
The best team I ever led in my career

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.276
was based on superpowers,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.956
and we even gave ourselves
fancy-pantsy titles

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.060
like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen."

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.276
"The Biscuit Butterer."

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.916
(Laughter)

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.180
"The Voice of Reason."

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.956
Because we relied on our strengths,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.236
our best strengths,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.460
we achieved tremendous outcomes.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.756
The trait that prevents me
from recognizing my mom

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.636
allows me to smoothly adapt,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.476
to quickly absorb and accurately process
an exhausting volume of cues,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.396
tease out what's important,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.476
determine multiple processes or potentials
for any situation that I'm in,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.460
and then select the one
that makes the most sense,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.980
all in a matter of seconds.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
I see what other people do not.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.670
Some people think that's a superpower,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.140
but my real superpowers

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.236
are ricocheting off of glass walls --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.756
(Laughter)

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.916
and letting my friends
walk around with kale in their teeth.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.236
(Laughter)

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.780
It's true. Don't have lunch with me,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.340
or dinner.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.556
Tip two: be supremely skilled,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.020
supremely skilled at getting it wrong.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.076
It is important to be
as equally confident in your superpowers

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.380
as you are in you FUBARs.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.996
That's "effed up beyond all recognition"

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.236
for you millennials.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.716
(Laughter)

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.940
Here's a good example.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.956
It is not a great idea to say,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.740
"Don't worry, everything in here
is too small for me to see"

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.556
when you accidentally
walk into the men's room --

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.476
(Laughter)

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.796
at one of the world's
largest sporting arenas --

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.556
(Laughter)

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.676
or anywhere.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.820
I really wish that one wasn't true.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.996
I'm serious. It is better to just walk out
and let them think you're drunk.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.916
(Laughter)

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.980
Tip three: know that everyone
is disabled in some way,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.196
like when you have a cold
and you can't smell

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.596
and you realize that the milk
that you splashed in your coffee was sour

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.580
only after you've tasted it.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.116
Very recently, a woman
walked up to me frantic.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.820
She could not find
the bakery she was looking for.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.316
As I motioned in the direction
I thought she should go,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.276
saying, "There are no stores
on this side of the street

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.316
so your best bet is to cross --"

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.716
"Oh my goodness," she interrupted.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.556
"There it is.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.476
All I needed was another set of eyes."

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.836
(Laughter)

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.140
I just let her have it.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.916
I would have said that, you know,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.636
being logical and paying attention

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.596
and staying calm
would have done the trick,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.820
but who am I?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.820
Tip four: point out
the disability in others.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.316
This one is best reserved --
very important note --

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.036
this one is best reserved
for people you know well,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.620
because random strangers
typically don't appreciate

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.740
teachable moments.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.316
A few years ago, my parents and I
went to see the Rockettes,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.220
Radio City's high-kicking dancers.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.420
I leaned over to my dad.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.260
"The two Rockettes on the left
aren't kicking in a straight line."

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.820
"Yes, they are."

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.820
"No, they're not."

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.676
"Yes, they are, and how do you know?

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.900
You can't see."

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.660
But I know what
a straight line looks like.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.356
I had snapped a picture
during our back and forth

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.620
and presented him the evidence
that proved I was right.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.900
He looked at the picture.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.980
I leaned in further.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.900
"Who's disabled now?"

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.660
Tip five: pursue audacious goals.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.756
Flip expectation upside down

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.900
and shove limitation off a cliff
to meet its demise.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.756
There is a college football linebacker

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.036
who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.420
while having one hand.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.436
There is a teacher
who successfully transfers knowledge

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.660
and inspires countless students

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.180
while living with Down syndrome.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.300
And for me,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.956
on my long list,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.836
to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal,
to Darjeeling, India

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.220
on the backseat
of a bicycle built for two.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.436
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.116
and I'm sure I will have
the blurry photos to show for it.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.956
(Laughter)

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.276
Oh, before we go on,
I forgot to introduce you to my mom.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.500
I need to do that.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.556
And here she is,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.636
as she would appear to me

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.500
if I were looking through a crowd
of people looking for her.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.180
Or is that an Asian man?

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.876
Thank you.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.100
(Applause)
