00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:17.231
What makes a great leader today?

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.874
Many of us carry this image

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.194
of this all-knowing superhero

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.642
who stands and commands

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:29.271
and protects his followers.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:33.567
But that's kind of an image from another time,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.818
and what's also outdated

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:38.220
are the leadership development programs

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.603
that are based on success models

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:44.785
for a world that was, not a world that is

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.949
or that is coming.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.360
We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.367
and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.958
of your leadership development programs.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.146
Fifty-eight percent of the companies

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:01.514
cited significant talent gaps

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.869
for critical leadership roles.

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.308
That means that despite
corporate training programs,

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:11.745
off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.686
more than half the companies

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:18.543
had failed to grow enough great leaders.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:20.566
You may be asking yourself,

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.297
is my company helping me to prepare

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:26.540
to be a great 21st-century leader?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.952
The odds are, probably not.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:34.015
Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:37.520
observing what makes great leaders.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.985
I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:42.054
I've advised over 200 CEOs,

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.813
and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.823
than you can imagine.

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:51.548
But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.763
in leadership preparation.

00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:58.589
I noticed that, despite all the efforts,

00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:01.128
there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing

00:02:01.128 --> 00:02:03.252
about individuals.

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:06.886
One story was about Chris,

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:09.230
a high-potential, superstar leader

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.832
who moves to a new unit and fails,

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.568
destroying unrecoverable value.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:19.161
And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.863
who was so frustrated

00:02:20.863 --> 00:02:22.930
because her company is cited

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.259
as a best company for leaders,

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:29.096
but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:31.681
to lead their crucial initiatives.

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.638
And then there were stories

00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:36.168
like the senior leadership team

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:38.248
of a once-thriving business

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:41.704
that's surprised by a market shift,

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:44.435
finds itself having to force the company

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.763
to reduce its size in half

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:49.576
or go out of business.

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:52.294
Now, these recurring stories

00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:54.861
cause me to ask two questions.

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.332
Why are the leadership gaps widening

00:02:57.332 --> 00:02:59.265
when there's so much more investment

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.489
in leadership development?

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.786
And what are the great leaders doing

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:08.661
distinctly different to thrive and grow?

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:11.030
One of the things that I did,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.706
I was so consumed by these questions

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:16.650
and also frustrated by those stories,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.058
that I left my job

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:21.638
so that I could study this full time,

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:24.583
and I took a year to travel

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.603
to different parts of the world

00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:28.989
to learn about effective and ineffective

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.374
leadership practices in companies,

00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.877
countries and nonprofit organizations.

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:38.204
And so I did things like travel to South Africa,

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:41.130
where I had an opportunity to understand

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.604
how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:45.495
in anticipating and navigating

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:48.912
his political, social and economic context.

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:51.935
I also met a number of nonprofit leaders

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.905
who, despite very limited financial resources,

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:58.848
were making a huge impact in the world,

00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:02.710
often bringing together seeming adversaries.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.765
And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.097
trying to understand how the environment

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:11.255
had shaped the leaders,

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:12.858
the moves that they made,

00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:14.384
and then the impact of those moves

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:17.311
beyond their tenure.

00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.312
And then, when I returned to work full time,

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:23.601
in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:27.093
who were also interested in these questions.

00:04:27.093 --> 00:04:30.038
Now, from all this, I distilled

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:34.042
the characteristics of leaders who are thriving

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:35.868
and what they do differently,

00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:38.321
and then I also distilled

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:41.263
the preparation practices that enable people

00:04:41.263 --> 00:04:43.904
to grow to their potential.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.852
I want to share some of those with you now.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.927
("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:51.292
In a 21st-century world, which is more global,

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.743
digitally enabled and transparent,

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:57.156
with faster speeds of information 
flow and innovation,

00:04:57.156 --> 00:04:59.451
and where nothing big gets done

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:02.687
without some kind of a complex matrix,

00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:06.347
relying on traditional development practices

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:09.005
will stunt your growth as a leader.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.852
In fact, traditional assessments

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:16.195
like narrow 360 surveys or
outdated performance criteria

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:18.233
will give you false positives,

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:21.659
lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.799
than you really are.

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:27.692
Leadership in the 21st century is defined

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:30.846
and evidenced by three questions.

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:32.180
Where are you looking

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.256
to anticipate the next change

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:38.729
to your business model or your life?

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.579
The answer to this question is on your calendar.

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:47.520
Who are you spending time with? On what topics?

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.068
Where are you traveling? What are you reading?

00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:51.815
And then how are you distilling this

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:55.522
into understanding potential discontinuities,

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.774
and then making a decision to do something

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:02.188
right now so that you're prepared and ready?

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:05.190
There's a leadership team that does a practice

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.162
where they bring together each member

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:10.969
collecting, here are trends that impact me,

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.254
here are trends that impact another team member,

00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:14.653
and they share these,

00:06:14.653 --> 00:06:17.449
and then make decisions,
to course-correct a strategy

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.706
or to anticipate a new move.

00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:23.759
Great leaders are not head-down.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.004
They see around corners,

00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:29.913
shaping their future, not just reacting to it.

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:31.868
The second question is,

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:33.887
what is the diversity measure

00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:37.506
of your personal and professional
stakeholder network?

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:40.508
You know, we hear often about 
good ol' boy networks

00:06:40.508 --> 00:06:44.416
and they're certainly alive and 
well in many institutions.

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:46.967
But to some extent, we all have a network

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:48.896
of people that we're comfortable with.

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:51.808
So this question is about your capacity

00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:54.307
to develop relationships with people

00:06:54.307 --> 00:06:55.830
that are very different than you.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.823
And those differences can be biological,

00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:03.607
physical, functional, political, 
cultural, socioeconomic.

00:07:03.607 --> 00:07:07.050
And yet, despite all these differences,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.807
they connect with you

00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:10.061
and they trust you enough

00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:11.343
to cooperate with you

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:14.481
in achieving a shared goal.

00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.816
Great leaders understand

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:19.745
that having a more diverse network

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:23.286
is a source of pattern identification

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.071
at greater levels and also of solutions,

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.895
because you have people that are thinking

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:30.580
differently than you are.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.930
Third question: are you courageous enough

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.832
to abandon a practice that has 
made you successful in the past?

00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:43.981
There's an expression: Go along to get along.

00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:46.899
But if you follow this advice,

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.291
chances are as a leader,

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:53.806
you're going to keep doing
what's familiar and comfortable.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.659
Great leaders dare to be different.

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:58.304
They don't just talk about risk-taking,

00:07:58.304 --> 00:08:00.122
they actually do it.

00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:03.034
And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that

00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:05.611
the most impactful development comes

00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:08.915
when you are able to build the emotional stamina

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:13.075
to withstand people telling you that your new idea

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:17.793
is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.

00:08:17.793 --> 00:08:21.655
Now interestingly, the people who will join you

00:08:21.655 --> 00:08:25.110
are not your usual suspects in your network.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.761
They're often people that think differently

00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:31.633
and therefore are willing to join you

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:33.992
in taking a courageous leap.

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:37.243
And it's a leap, not a step.

00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:40.152
More than traditional leadership programs,

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:42.034
answering these three questions

00:08:42.034 --> 00:08:43.417
will determine your effectiveness

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:46.886
as a 21st-century leader.

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:51.307
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:54.856
I've met many, and they stand out.

00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:56.507
They are women and men

00:08:56.507 --> 00:08:58.273
who are preparing themselves

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:01.392
not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday

00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:05.168
but also for the realities of today

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:09.429
and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.

00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:11.856
Thank you.

00:09:11.856 --> 00:09:14.534
(Applause)
