00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
This is a world-changing invention.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
of lives, worldwide.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
with 350,000 home fires.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
What if we could prevent electrical fires

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
before they start?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
So how does electricity ignite residential fires?

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Well it turns out that the main causes

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
Our invention had to address all of these issues.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
So what about circuit breakers?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
This is 130-year-old technology,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
and this is a problem, because over 80 percent

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
of all home electrical fires

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Hmmm ...

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
So we considered all of this. And we realized

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
that electrical appliances

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
must be able to communicate directly

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
with the power receptacle itself.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever --

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
must be able to tell the power outlet,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
"Hey, power outlet,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.330
I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire."

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
a data tag, in the appliance plug.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
so they could communicate.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, every home electrical system

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
becomes an intelligent network.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
The appliance's safe operating parameters

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
are embedded into its plug.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
If too much current is flowing,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
the intelligent receptacle turns itself off,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
and prevents another fire from starting.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
We call this technology EFCI,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
roughly 2,500 children

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
because the power is always off,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Now, besides saving lives,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
is in its energy savings.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
This invention will reduce global energy consumption

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
by allowing remote control and automation

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
of every outlet in every home and business.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
by automatically cycling heavy loads

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
like air conditioners and heaters.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
from a central location, or even a cell phone.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
There are 10 billion electrical outlets

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
in North America alone.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
The potential energy savings is very, very significant.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Of those, 186 have been granted:

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
228 are in process.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
we received our first international recognition,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
the 2009 CES Innovation Award.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
So, to conclude,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
prevent tens of thousands of injuries,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
every single year,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
while significantly reducing global energy consumption.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.330
Thank you.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
(Applause)
