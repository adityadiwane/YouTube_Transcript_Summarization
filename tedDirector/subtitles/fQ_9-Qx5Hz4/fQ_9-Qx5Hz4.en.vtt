00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Cultural evolution is a dangerous child

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
for any species to let loose on its planet.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
By the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.330
up and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
We humans are Earth's Pandoran species.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.330
We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and we can't push it back in.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
We're seeing the consequences all around us.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Now that, I suggest, is the view that

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
comes out of taking memetics seriously.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
And it gives us a new way of thinking about

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
not only what's going on on our planet,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
and the theory of memes,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
if indeed anyone is.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
So, memetics:

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.330
memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Darwin had this amazing idea.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Indeed, some people say

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
it's the best idea anybody ever had.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
as a best idea anybody ever had?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.330
Do you think there could?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Audience: No.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.330
(Laughter)

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
Why?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Because the idea was so simple,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.330
and yet it explains all design in the universe.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
I would say not just biological design,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
but all of the design that we think of as human design.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
It's all just the same thing happening.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
What did Darwin say?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I know you know the idea, natural selection,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
but let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
in a few sentences.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
What Darwin said was something like this:

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted --

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And 100 pages later.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
(Laughter)

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And if there is a struggle for life,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
such that nearly all of these creatures die --

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And another 100 pages later.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
whatever it was that helped them survive,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
then those offspring must be better adapted

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
to the circumstances in which all this happened

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
than their parents were.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
You see the idea?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
If, if, if, then.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
but that's what he described in that book,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
The principle is you just need those three things --

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
variation, selection and heredity.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
then you must get evolution.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.330
Or design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
There's one word I love on that slide.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
What do you think my favorite word is?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.330
Audience: Chaos.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
SB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.330
Audience: Without.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.330
SB: No, not without.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.330
(Laughter)

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
You try them all in order: Mmm...?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Audience: Must.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
SB: Must, at must. Must, must.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
This is what makes it so amazing.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
You don't need a designer,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
If there's something that is copied with variation

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
You can't stop it.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
Must is my favorite word there.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Now, what's this to do with memes?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
Well, the principle here applies to anything

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.330
that is copied with variation and selection.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
We're so used to thinking in terms of biology,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
we think about genes this way.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
Darwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
He talked mostly about animals and plants,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
But the principle of Universal Darwinism

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
is that any information that is varied and selected

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
will produce design.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
in his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene."

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.330
The information that is copied, he called the replicator.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
It selfishly copies.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
But that it will get copied if it can,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
regardless of the consequences.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
because it's just information being copied.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.330
And he wanted to get away

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
from everybody thinking all the time about genes,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Ah, yes, there is.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
Look around you -- here will do, in this room.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
All around us, still clumsily drifting about

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
by language, by talking, by telling stories,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
by wearing clothes, by doing things.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.330
This is information copied with variation and selection.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
This is design process going on.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
He wanted a name for the new replicator.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Remember that, that's the core definition:

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.330
that which is imitated.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
So that's how the idea came about.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
It's important to stick with that definition.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
The whole science of memetics is much maligned,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
much misunderstood, much feared.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
But a lot of these problems can be avoided

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
by remembering the definition.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Stick with the definition.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
It's that which is imitated,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
or information which is copied from person to person.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.330
So, let's see some memes.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
in that particularly fetching way.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
or copied it from someone else?

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
If you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
And what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Oh, well, your earrings,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
You probably went out and bought them.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
There are plenty more in the shops.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
That's something that's passed on from person to person.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
The way to think about memes, though,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
is to think, why do they spread?

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
But some of them will be copied because they're good,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
or true, or useful, or beautiful.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
Some of them will be copied even though they're not.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Some, it's quite hard to tell why.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
and I'm sure all of you found it, too.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and you come in and you put down your clothes

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.330
Audience: Bathroom soap.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.330
SB: Pardon?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.330
Audience: Soap.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Audience: (Inaudible)

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.330
SB: Mmm mmm.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Audience: Sink, toilet!

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
(Laughter)

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
What is this one doing?

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.330
(Laughter)

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
This has spread all over the world.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
It's not surprising that you all found it

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
when you arrived in your bathrooms here.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.330
But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.330
(Laughter)

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Who folded that thing up there, and why?

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.330
(Laughter)

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Some people get carried away.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
(Laughter)

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
Other people are just lazy and make mistakes.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
with a little sticker.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.330
(Laughter)

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
What is this all about?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
cleaned the place, and it's all lovely.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
And you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
has potentially spread germs from place to place.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.330
(Laughter)

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
So, think of it this way.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Imagine a world full of brains

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
and far more memes than can possibly find homes.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
The memes are all trying to get copied --

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
trying, in inverted commas -- i.e.,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.330
They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
and we are the meme machines.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Now, why is this important?

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
Why is this useful, or what does it tell us?

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.330
It gives us a completely new view of human origins

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.330
and what it means to be human,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
all conventional theories of cultural evolution,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
of the origin of humans,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
and what makes us so different from other species.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
All other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
and all these things that make us unique,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
are based upon genes.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
Language must have been useful for the genes.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Tool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.330
The point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't."

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
There are two replicators now on this planet.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
From the moment that our ancestors,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
perhaps two and a half million years ago or so,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.330
began imitating, there was a new copying process.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Copying with variation and selection.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.330
A new replicator was let loose, and it could never be --

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.330
right from the start -- it could never be

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.330
that human beings who let loose this new creature,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
and not copy the other things.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy --

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.330
lighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
these kinds of things --

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
or wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.330
or whatever.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
So, you get an arms race between the genes

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
and not waste their time copying all this stuff,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
and the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied --

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.330
in other words, what turned out to be language --

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
So, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.330
This is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
As the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.330
they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
that are doing the driving.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.330
This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
that we like religion, and music, and art.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
Language is a parasite that we've adapted to,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
not something that was there originally for our genes,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
on this view.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And like most parasites, it can begin dangerous,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
but then it coevolves and adapts,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
and we end up with a symbiotic relationship

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.330
with this new parasite.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And so, from our perspective,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
we don't realize that that's how it began.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
So, this is a view of what humans are.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
All other species on this planet are gene machines only,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.330
We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
But that's not all.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
We have a new kind of memes now.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.330
I've been wondering for a long time,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
since I've been thinking about memes a lot,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
is there a difference between the memes that we copy --

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
the words we speak to each other,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
the gestures we copy, the human things --

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
and all these technological things around us?

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.330
I have always, until now, called them all memes,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
but I do honestly think now

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
we need a new word for technological memes.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
Let's call them techno-memes or temes.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Because the processes are getting different.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
We began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:47.330
We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
but in order to get true temes and true teme machines,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
all done outside of humans.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And we're getting there.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
that there are machines like that.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
I see we're even closer than I thought we were before.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:11.330
So actually, now the temes are forcing our brains

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
to become more like teme machines.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
learning to use machinery.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.330
We're going to have all kinds of implants,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
drugs that force us to stay awake all the time.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
We'll think we're choosing these things,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
but the temes are making us do it.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.330
So, we're at this cusp now

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
of having a third replicator on our planet.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.330
Now, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
Is there anyone else out there?

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
People have been asking this question for a long time.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
We've been asking it here at TED already.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
It's been very productive, that equation.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
He wanted to estimate N,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
and he included in there the rate of star formation,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
the rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
I think that's the wrong way to think about it.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
Intelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
But what's really important is the replicators you have

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
and the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.330
So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
we think replicators.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
And on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
A very simple equation.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
N, the same thing,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
the number of communicative civilizations out there

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
[that] we might expect in our galaxy.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.330
Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.330
The fraction of those which get a first replicator.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.330
The fraction of those that get the second replicator.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
The fraction of those that get the third replicator.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out --

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
sending information, sending probes, getting out there,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and communicating with anywhere else.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
OK, so if we take that equation,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:14.330
why haven't we heard from anybody out there?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Because every step is dangerous.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
Getting a new replicator is dangerous.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
You can pull through, we have pulled through,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
but it's dangerous.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
Take the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
We may take the Gaian view.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday -- it's not Gaian all the time.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
Actually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Well, we did pull through on this planet.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
But then, a long time later, billions of years later,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
we got the second replicator, the memes.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
That was dangerous, all right.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
Think of the big brain.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
How many mothers do we have here?

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
You know all about big brains.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
They are dangerous to give birth to,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.330
are agonizing to give birth to.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.330
(Laughter)

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
My cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Ah, mm -- slightly different.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
(Laughter)

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
But not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
it kills lots of mothers,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
and it's very expensive to produce.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
The genes are forced into producing all this myelin,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
all the fat to myelinate the brain.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
Do you know, sitting here,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.330
your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
for two percent of your body weight?

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
It's a really expensive organ to run.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
Why? Because it's producing the memes.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.330
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off,

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
But maybe it nearly did.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.330
Has it been tried before?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
What about all those other species?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.330
Louise Leakey talked yesterday

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
about how we're the only one in this branch left.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
What happened to the others?

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.330
Could it be that this experiment in imitation,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
this experiment in a second replicator,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.330
is dangerous enough to kill people off?

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
Well, we did pull through, and we adapted.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
But now, we're hitting, as I've just described,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.330
we're hitting the third replicator point.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
And this is even more dangerous --

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
well, it's dangerous again.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.330
Why? Because the temes are selfish replicators

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.330
and they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.330
They're just information, why would they?

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
They are using us to suck up the planet's resources

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
to produce more computers,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.330
and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.330
Don't think, "Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit."

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.330
That's how it seems to us.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.330
Think, temes spreading because they must.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
We are the old machines.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Now, are we going to pull through?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.330
What's going to happen?

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.330
What does it mean to pull through?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
One that is obviously happening all around us now,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
is that the temes turn us into teme machines,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
with these implants, with the drugs,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330
with us merging with the technology.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.330
And why would they do that?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.330
Because we are self-replicating.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
We have babies.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.330
We make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.330
because we're not yet at the stage on this planet

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.330
where the other option is viable.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
Although it's closer, I heard this morning,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
it's closer than I thought it was.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.330
Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.330
That way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.330
was utterly destabilized,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
and it was no longer possible for humans to live here.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need --

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.330
they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.330
warmth-requiring creatures.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.330
They could carry on without us.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.330
So, those are the two possibilities.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.330
The second, I don't think we're that close.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.330
It's coming, but we're not there yet.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.330
The first, it's coming too.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.330
But the damage that is already being done

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:54.330
to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is,

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
that third danger point, getting a third replicator.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.330
And will we get through this third danger point,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.330
like we got through the second and like we got through the first?

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.330
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.330
I have no idea.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:23.330
(Applause)

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.330
Chris Anderson: That was an incredible talk.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.330
SB: Thank you. I scared myself.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.330
CA: (Laughter)
