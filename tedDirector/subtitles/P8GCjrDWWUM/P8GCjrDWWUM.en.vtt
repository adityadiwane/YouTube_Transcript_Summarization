00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.054
Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.642
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:22.552
MW: Or ...

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.393
a paradise lost.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.234
Bali:

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:28.639
island of garbage.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:30.859
IW: In Bali,

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:36.834
we generate 680 cubic meters
of plastic garbage a day.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.657
That's about a 14-story building.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.426
And when it comes to plastic bags,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.018
less than five percent gets recycled.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.206
MW: We know that changes the image
you may have of our island.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.150
It changed ours, too,
when we learned about it,

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:57.735
when we learned that almost all
plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.009
and then in our rivers

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:00.404
and then in our ocean.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.364
And those that don't even
make it to the ocean,

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.501
they're either burned or littered.

00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:08.441
IW: So we decided
to do something about it.

00:01:08.812 --> 00:01:11.311
And we've been working
for almost three years now

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:14.687
to try to say no to plastic bags
on our home island.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.175
And we have had
some significant successes.

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:20.867
MW: We are sisters,

00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:23.458
and we go to the best school on earth:

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.586
Green School, Bali.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.233
Green School is not only different
in the way that it is built out of bamboo,

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.220
but also in the way that it teaches.

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:35.551
We are taught to become leaders of today,

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:38.951
something a normal textbook cannot match.

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:41.834
IW: One day we had a lesson in class

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:44.571
where we learned about significant people,

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:46.083
like Nelson Mandela,

00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:47.258
Lady Diana

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:48.507
and Mahatma Gandhi.

00:01:49.244 --> 00:01:50.401
Walking home that day,

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.733
we agreed that we also
wanted to be significant.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.651
Why should we wait until we were grown up

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:57.933
to be significant?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.494
We wanted to do something now.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:02.835
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.695
we brainstormed and thought
of all the issues facing Bali.

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:08.396
And one thing that stood out
to us the most

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.784
was the plastic garbage.

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:12.603
But that is a huge problem.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.671
So we looked into what was
a realistic target for us kids:

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.820
plastic bags.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:20.237
And the idea was born.

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:22.964
IW: We started researching,

00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:25.928
and let's just say, the more we learned,

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:29.041
there was nothing good about plastic bags.

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.671
And you know what?

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:32.273
We don't even need them.

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:36.544
MW: We were really inspired
by the efforts to say no to plastic bags

00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:38.438
in many other places,

00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:40.444
from Hawaii to Rwanda

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.013
and to severals cities
like Oakland and Dublin.

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:49.449
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch
of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:52.850
MW: In the years
that we have been campaigning,

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:55.436
we have learned a lot.

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:57.626
Lesson number one:

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.391
you cannot do it all by yourself.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.607
You need a big team of like-minded kids,

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:05.802
and so we formed
the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.574
The volunteer team includes
children from all over the island,

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.997
from both international and local schools.

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:13.656
And together with them,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.430
we started a multi-layered approach,

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:18.750
based on an on- and off-line
signature petition,

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:22.210
educational and inspirational
presentations at schools

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:26.719
and we raise general awareness
at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:27.894
And last but not least,

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:29.964
we distribute alternative bags,

00:03:29.988 --> 00:03:31.712
bags like net bags,

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.058
recycled newspaper bags

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.802
or 100 percent organic material bags,

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:38.339
all made by local
initiatives on the island.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:40.292
IW: We run a pilot village,

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.428
home of 800 families.

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:44.775
The village mayor was our first friend

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.265
and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:50.745
We focused on making the customers aware,

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.487
because that's where the change
needs to happen.

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.463
The village is already
two-thirds along the way

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:58.492
of becoming plastic bag free.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.205
Our first attempts to get the government
of Bali on board failed.

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:05.846
So we thought,

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:10.691
"Hmm ... a petition
with one million signatures.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:12.708
They can't ignore us, right?"

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:13.895
MW: Right!

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.093
IW: But, who would have guessed

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:20.279
one million signatures is, like,
a thousand times a thousand?

00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:21.930
(Laughter)

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.835
We got stuck --

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.738
till we learned lesson number two:

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:29.462
think outside the box.

00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:30.959
Someone mentioned

00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:37.384
that the Bali airport handles
16 million arrivals and departures a year.

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:41.610
MW: But how do we get into the airport?

00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:43.686
And here comes lesson number three:

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:45.676
persistence.

00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:47.768
Off we headed to the airport.

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.444
We got past the janitor.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.705
And then it was his boss's boss,

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.990
and then the assistant office manager,

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:55.399
and then the office manager,

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:56.594
and then ...

00:04:56.618 --> 00:04:58.765
we got shuffled down
two levels and thought,

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.954
well, here comes the janitor again.

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:03.585
And after several days knocking on doors

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:05.925
and just being kids on a mission,

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.837
we finally got to the commercial
manager of Bali airports.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:14.281
And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags"
speech, and being a very nice man,

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:18.003
he said, [imitating the man's voice]
"I cannot believe what I'm about say,

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.270
but I'm going to give authorization

00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:23.251
to collect signatures
behind customs and immigrations."

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:24.619
(Laughter)

00:05:24.643 --> 00:05:28.938
(Applause)

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.906
IW: In our first hour and a half there,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.605
we got almost 1,000 signatures.

00:05:33.954 --> 00:05:35.255
How cool is that?

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.851
Lesson number four:

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.876
you need champions
at all levels of society,

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:45.295
from students to commercial
managers to famous people.

00:05:46.097 --> 00:05:48.209
And thanks to the attraction
of Green School,

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:50.899
we had access to a steady
stream of celebrities.

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:53.136
Ban Ki Moon taught us

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.521
that Secretary-Generals
of the United Nations

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.196
don't sign petitions --

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.221
(Laughter)

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:01.082
even if kids ask nicely.

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.791
But he promised to spread the word,

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:05.328
and now we work closely
with the United Nations.

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.644
MW: Jane Goodall taught us
the power of a people's network.

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:12.095
She started with just one
Roots &amp; Shoots group

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.410
and now she has 4,000 groups
around the world.

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:16.607
We are one of them.

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:18.073
She's a real inspiration.

00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:20.483
If you're a fellow Rotarian,

00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:21.797
nice to meet you.

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:22.972
We're Interactors,

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:25.327
the youngest department
of Rotary International.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.816
IW: But we have also learned
much about patience,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.097
MW: how to deal with frustrations,

00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:33.272
IW: leadership,

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:34.465
MW: teamwork,

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:35.640
IW: friendship,

00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:38.323
MW: we learned more
about the Balinese and their culture

00:06:38.347 --> 00:06:41.505
IW: and we learned
about the importance of commitment.

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.840
MW: It's not always easy.

00:06:43.864 --> 00:06:47.329
Sometimes it does get
a little bit hard to walk your talk.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.257
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.

00:06:50.663 --> 00:06:52.266
We went to India to give a talk,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.845
and our parents took us to visit

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:56.457
the former private house
of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.470
We learned about the power
of hunger strikes

00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:00.770
he did to reach his goals.

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.327
Yes, by the end of the tour,

00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.002
when we met our parents again,

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:06.692
we both made a decision and said,

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:08.472
"We're going on a hunger strike!"

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.497
(Laughter)

00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:12.420
MW: And you can probably
imagine their faces.

00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:14.722
It took a lot of convincing,

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.478
and not only to our parents

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:18.794
but to our friends
and to our teachers as well.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:22.532
Isabel and I were serious
about doing this.

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.165
So we met with a nutritionist,

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.029
and we came up with a compromise

00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:30.318
of not eating from sunrise
to sunset every day

00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:32.947
until the governor of Bali
would agree to meet with us

00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:36.458
to talk about how to stop
plastic bags on Bali.

00:07:37.118 --> 00:07:41.138
IW: Our "mogak makan,"
as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,

00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:42.313
started.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.326
We used social media to support our goal

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.117
and already on day two,

00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.407
police started to come
to our home and school.

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:50.921
What were these two girls doing?

00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:53.976
We knew we weren't making
the governor look his best

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.881
by doing this food strike --

00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:57.339
we could have gone to jail.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.697
But, hey, it worked.

00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.947
Twenty-four hours later,

00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:02.383
we were picked up from school

00:08:02.407 --> 00:08:04.430
and escorted to the office
of the governor.

00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:06.796
MW: And there he was --

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.029
(Applause)

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:10.983
waiting for us to meet and speak,

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.557
being all supportive
and thankful for our willingness

00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.193
to care for the beauty
and the environment of Bali.

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:17.963
He signed a promise

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:20.738
to help the people of Bali
say no to plastic bags.

00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:21.916
And we are now friends,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.336
and on a regular basis,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.657
we remind him and his team
of the promises he has made.

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:28.523
And indeed,

00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:30.453
recently he stated and committed

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:35.120
that Bali will be
plastic bag free by 2018.

00:08:35.144 --> 00:08:41.980
(Applause)

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:48.115
IW: Also, at the International Airport
of Bali, one of our supporters

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.701
is planning to start
a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:55.173
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags

00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:56.893
and bring in your own reusable bag

00:08:56.917 --> 00:09:00.361
is our next message to change
that mindset of the public.

00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:03.102
IW: Our short-term campaign,

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.558
"One Island / One Voice,"

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.016
is all about this.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.719
We check and recognize
the shops and restaurants

00:09:08.743 --> 00:09:11.586
that have declared themselves
a plastic bag-free zone,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.983
and we put this sticker at their entrance

00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:16.325
and publish their names on social media

00:09:16.349 --> 00:09:18.425
and some important magazines on Bali.

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:19.980
And conversely,

00:09:20.004 --> 00:09:22.829
that highlights those
who do not have the sticker.

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.240
(Laughter)

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:28.050
MW: So, why are we actually
telling you all of this?

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:30.591
Well, partly, it is because we are proud

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.686
of the results that,
together with our team,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.066
we have been able to reach.

00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:36.557
But also because along the way,

00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:39.421
we have learned that kids can do things.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.099
We can make things happen.

00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:44.318
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old

00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:45.901
when we started this.

00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:47.978
We never had a business plan,

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:49.226
nor a fixed strategy,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.169
nor any hidden agendas --

00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:53.633
just the idea in front of us

00:09:53.657 --> 00:09:55.770
and a group of friends working with us.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.441
All we wanted to do
was stop those plastic bags

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:01.107
from wrapping and suffocating
our beautiful home.

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:03.641
Kids have a boundless energy

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:07.830
and a motivation to be the change
the world needs.

00:10:08.454 --> 00:10:13.179
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful
but challenging world:

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:14.844
go for it!

00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:16.623
Make that difference.

00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:19.476
We're not telling you
it's going to be easy.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.767
We're telling you
it's going to be worth it.

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:26.592
Us kids may only be 25 percent
of the world's population,

00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:29.923
but we are 100 percent of the future.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.706
MW: We still have a lot of work to do,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.395
but know that we still not stop

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:39.844
until the first question asked
when arriving at the Bali airports will be

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.016
Both: "Welcome to Bali,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.207
do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"

00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:45.644
(Laughter)

00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:48.404
Om shanti shanti shanti om.

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:49.579
Thank you.

00:10:49.603 --> 00:10:59.396
(Applause)
