Tommy Mizzone: Tonight we're going to play you two songs.

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:20.482
We're three brothers from New Jersey,

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.130
and the funny thing is that,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.770
believe it or not, we are hooked on bluegrass

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.926
and we're excited to play it for you tonight.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:02:22.740

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:36.091
I'm Robbie Mizzone. I'm 13, and I play the fiddle.

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.651
This is my brother, Jonny. He's 10, and he plays the banjo.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.380
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.227

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:48.182
