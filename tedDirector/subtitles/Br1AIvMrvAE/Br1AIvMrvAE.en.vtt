00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:14.416
I'd like to start, if I may,

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:17.140
with the story of the Paisley snail.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.355
On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.729
May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.260
to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.573
and there at the Wellmeadow CafÃ©,

00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:30.699
she had a Scots ice cream float,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.546
a mix of ice cream and ginger beer

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:34.501
bought for her by a friend.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.902
The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.765
labeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.841
She drank some of the ice cream float,

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.675
but as the remaining ginger beer was poured

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.071
into her tumbler,

00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:48.524
a decomposed snail

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.106
floated to the surface of her glass.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.650
Three days later, she was admitted

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.156
to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.214
and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:58.167
and shock.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:01.435
The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:04.080
set a very important legal precedent:

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.811
Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.588
was held to have a clear duty of care

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:10.036
towards May Donoghue,

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.138
even though there was no contract between them,

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.955
and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.974
One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:20.884
You must take care to avoid acts or omissions

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:22.952
which you can reasonably foresee

00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:26.180
would be likely to injure your neighbor.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.523
Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:30.269
how many people would have had to suffer

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.993
from gastroenteritis before Stevenson
eventually went out of business.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.374
Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,

00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:39.607
because it's an important principle.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:42.101
Last year, the Hansard Society,
a nonpartisan charity

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.007
which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.244
and encourage greater public involvement in politics

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.831
published, alongside their annual audit

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:52.704
of political engagement, an additional section

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.827
devoted entirely to politics and the media.

00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.202
Here are a couple of rather depressing observations

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:00.210
from that survey.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.375
Tabloid newspapers do not appear

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:05.208
to advance the political citizenship of their readers,

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.781
relative even to those

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.007
who read no newspapers whatsoever.

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.999
Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.850
with a negative view of politics

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.425
than readers of no newspapers.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.418
They're not just less politically engaged.

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:21.866
They are consuming media that reinforces

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.828
their negative evaluation of politics,

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.931
thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical

00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:30.266
attitude to democracy and their own role within it.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.426
Little wonder that the report concluded that

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:35.616
in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:37.955
appear not to be living up to the importance

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.591
of their role in our democracy.

00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.650
Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.097
challenge that view.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.713
But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:48.689
then we've got a very serious problem on our hands,

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.324
and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:53.353
focusing upon.

00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:55.036
Since the Paisley snail,

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:57.500
and especially over the past decade or so,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.419
a great deal of thinking has been developed

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.278
around the notion of a duty of care

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:03.817
as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.561
Generally a duty of care arises when one individual

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.295
or a group of individuals undertakes an activity

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:11.825
which has the potential to cause harm to another,

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.539
either physically, mentally or economically.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.010
This is principally focused on obvious areas,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.052
such as our empathetic response
to children and young people,

00:03:20.052 --> 00:03:22.778
to our service personnel, and
to the elderly and infirm.

00:03:22.778 --> 00:03:26.971
It is seldom, if ever, extended
to equally important arguments

00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:31.221
around the fragility of our
present system of government,

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:34.730
to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.874
are fundamental to the process of building

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.603
and embedding an informed,

00:03:38.603 --> 00:03:41.360
participatory democracy.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.781
And the more you think about it,

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:44.612
the stranger that is.

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:46.074
A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:47.828
of opening a brand new school

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.399
in the northeast of England.

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.938
It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.

00:03:52.938 --> 00:03:54.790
As I walked through their impressive,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.165
glass-covered atrium,

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:57.983
in front of me, emblazoned on the wall

00:03:57.983 --> 00:03:59.531
in letters of fire

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.632
was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.487
If it's not true, don't say it;

00:04:05.487 --> 00:04:08.570
if it's not right, don't do it.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.558
The head teacher saw me staring at it,

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.350
and he said, "Oh, that's our school motto."

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.077
On the train back to London,

00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:16.931
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.490
I kept thinking, can it really have taken us

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.701
over 2,000 years to come to terms

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.566
with that simple notion

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:26.518
as being our minimum expectation of each other?

00:04:26.518 --> 00:04:29.126
Isn't it time that we develop this concept

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:30.795
of a duty of care

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:33.221
and extended it to include a care

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.485
for our shared but increasingly
endangered democratic values?

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.342
After all, the absence of a duty of care

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:39.932
within many professions

00:04:39.932 --> 00:04:42.435
can all too easily amount to
accusations of negligence,

00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:45.542
and that being the case, can we be
really comfortable with the thought

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.843
that we're in effect being negligent

00:04:47.843 --> 00:04:50.634
in respect of the health of our own societies

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:53.369
and the values that necessarily underpin them?

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:56.364
Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,

00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:59.620
that the same media which
Hansard so roundly condemned

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.907
have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:06.349
in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.450
would be likely to undermine or even damage

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.284
our inherently fragile democratic settlement.

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:13.305
Now there will be those who will argue

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:15.078
that this could all too easily drift into a form

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.085
of censorship, albeit self-censorship,

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.041
but I don't buy that argument.

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.100
It has to be possible

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.200
to balance freedom of expression

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.407
with wider moral and social responsibilities.

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:28.258
Let me explain why by taking the example

00:05:28.258 --> 00:05:31.161
from my own career as a filmmaker.

00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:32.968
Throughout that career, I never accepted

00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:34.595
that a filmmaker should set about putting

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.645
their own work outside or above what he or she

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:39.595
believed to be a decent set of values

00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:42.944
for their own life, their own family,

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:46.535
and the future of the society in which we all live.

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:47.859
I'd go further.

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:51.153
A responsible filmmaker should
never devalue their work

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:53.197
to a point at which it becomes less than true

00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:56.637
to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.

00:05:56.637 --> 00:06:00.023
As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:02.547
are all required to face up to the social expectations

00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:06.302
that come with combining the
intrinsic power of their medium

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:09.676
with their well-honed professional skills.

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:12.563
Obviously this is not a mandated duty,

00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:15.045
but for the gifted filmmaker
and the responsible journalist

00:06:15.045 --> 00:06:18.854
or even blogger, it strikes me
as being utterly inescapable.

00:06:18.865 --> 00:06:21.464
We should always remember that our notion

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.355
of individual freedom and
its partner, creative freedom,

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.150
is comparatively new

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.412
in the history of Western ideas,

00:06:28.412 --> 00:06:30.330
and for that reason, it's often undervalued

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.693
and can be very quickly undermined.

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:34.920
It's a prize easily lost,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.683
and once lost, once surrendered,

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:40.000
it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.525
And its first line of defense

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.876
has to be our own standards,

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:47.615
not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.438
our own standards and our own integrity.

00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:51.432
Our integrity as we deal with those

00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:52.980
with whom we work

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.605
and our own standards as we operate within society.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:58.075
And these standards of ours

00:06:58.075 --> 00:07:01.340
need to be all of a piece with
a sustainable social agenda.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.453
They're part of a collective responsibility,

00:07:03.453 --> 00:07:05.583
the responsibility of the artist or the journalist

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:07.957
to deal with the world as it really is,

00:07:07.957 --> 00:07:10.406
and this, in turn, must go hand in hand

00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:12.824
with the responsibility of those governing society

00:07:12.824 --> 00:07:14.901
to also face up to that world,

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.261
and not to be tempted to misappropriate

00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:19.853
the causes of its ills.

00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:22.499
Yet, as has become strikingly clear

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:24.567
over the last couple of years,

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:26.601
such responsibility has to a very great extent

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.644
been abrogated by large sections of the media.

00:07:29.644 --> 00:07:31.584
And as a consequence, across the Western world,

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:34.883
the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest

00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:37.268
and their appeal to a largely disillusioned,

00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:38.657
older demographic,

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:40.865
along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:42.763
that typifies at least some of the young,

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.821
taken together, these and other similarly

00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.902
contemporary aberrations

00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:48.949
are threatening to squeeze the life

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.523
out of active, informed debate and engagement,

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.050
and I stress active.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.327
The most ardent of libertarians might argue

00:07:57.327 --> 00:08:00.321
that Donoghue v. Stevenson should
have been thrown out of court

00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.439
and that Stevenson would eventually
have gone out of business

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.856
if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:09.270
But most of us, I think, accept some small role

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.348
for the state to enforce a duty of care,

00:08:12.348 --> 00:08:15.020
and the key word here is reasonable.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.600
Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.015
and could they have reasonably foreseen

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:22.213
the consequences of their actions?

00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:25.195
Far from signifying overbearing state power,

00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:28.720
it's that small common sense test of reasonableness

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.379
that I'd like us to apply to those in the media

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:33.650
who, after all, set the tone and the content

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.967
for much of our democratic discourse.

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:39.687
Democracy, in order to work, requires that

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:42.635
reasonable men and women take
the time to understand and debate

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.967
difficult, sometimes complex issues,

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:47.260
and they do so in an atmosphere which strives

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.659
for the type of understanding that leads to,

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.726
if not agreement, then at least a productive

00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:54.093
and workable compromise.

00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:56.450
Politics is about choices,

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.441
and within those choices, politics is about priorities.

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:02.979
It's about reconciling conflicting preferences

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:08.195
wherever and whenever possibly based on fact.

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:10.666
But if the facts themselves are distorted,

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:14.389
the resolutions are likely only
to create further conflict,

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:16.276
with all the stresses and strains on society

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:18.492
that inevitably follow.

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:20.439
The media have to decide:

00:09:20.439 --> 00:09:23.613
Do they see their role as being to inflame

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:25.943
or to inform?

00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:28.805
Because in the end, it comes down to a combination

00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:31.296
of trust and leadership.

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:33.873
Fifty years ago this week,
President John F. Kennedy

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.479
made two epoch-making speeches,

00:09:35.479 --> 00:09:38.976
the first on disarmament
and the second on civil rights.

00:09:38.976 --> 00:09:41.078
The first led almost immediately

00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.659
to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:45.724
and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,

00:09:45.724 --> 00:09:49.310
both of which represented giant leaps forward.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.715
Democracy, well-led and well-informed,

00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:54.208
can achieve very great things,

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:55.881
but there's a precondition.

00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:59.192
We have to trust that those making those decisions

00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:01.659
are acting in the best interest not of themselves

00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.423
but of the whole of the people.

00:10:03.423 --> 00:10:06.502
We need factually-based options,

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:07.741
clearly laid out,

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.139
not those of a few powerful

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:11.236
and potentially manipulative corporations

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.603
pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,

00:10:13.603 --> 00:10:16.032
but accurate, unprejudiced information

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.408
with which to make our own judgments.

00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:20.302
If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives

00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:22.613
for our children and our children's children,

00:10:22.613 --> 00:10:25.730
we need to exercise to the
very greatest degree possible

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.442
that duty of care for a vibrant,

00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:30.339
and hopefully a lasting, democracy.

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.422
Thank you very much for listening to me.

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:36.361
(Applause)
