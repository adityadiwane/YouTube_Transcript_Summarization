00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Two years ago here at TED

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I reported that we had discovered

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
an anomalously warm and geologically active region

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Enceladus, seen here.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
This region seen here for the first time

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.330
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
And seen just recently in late 2008,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
here is that region again,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
is experiencing the onset of August

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
and eventually winter.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery --

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
this once-in-a-lifetime discovery

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
of towering jets

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
erupting from those fractures at the south pole,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
consisting of tiny water ice crystals

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
accompanied by water vapor

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
And at that time two years ago

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
I mentioned that we were speculating

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
that these jets might in fact be geysers,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
and erupting from pockets

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
but we weren't really sure.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
However, the implications of those results --

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
of a possible environment within this moon

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
that could support prebiotic chemistry,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
and perhaps life itself --

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
we have focused more on Enceladus.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
by this moon now several times,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
flying closer and deeper into these jets,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
into the denser regions of these jets,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
so that now we have come away with some

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
very precise compositional measurements.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And we have found

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
that the organic compounds coming from this moon

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
are in fact more complex than we previously reported.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
While they're not amino acids,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
we're now finding things like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
propane and benzene,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And the tiny water crystals here

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
now look for all the world

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
like they are frozen droplets of salty water,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
which is a discovery that suggests

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
that not only do the jets come from

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
pockets of liquid water,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
And that is a circumstance

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
that could supply the chemical energy

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
So we are very encouraged by these results.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
that we might indeed

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
have on this moon, under the south pole,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
is an entirely different matter.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
And that will have to await the arrival,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
back at Enceladus,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
specifically equipped to address that particular question.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
when we might journey to the Saturnine system,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
just because we can.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
Thank you.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.330
