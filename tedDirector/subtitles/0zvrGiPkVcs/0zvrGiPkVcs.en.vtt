00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I have a pretty strong French accent,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
so that's going to be clear in a moment.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Maybe a sobering thought

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and something you all know about.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And I suspect many of you gave

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
something to the people of Haiti this year.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And there is something else

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I believe in the back of your mind

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
you also know.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
That is, every day,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
25,000 children die

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
of entirely preventable causes.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And I suspect many of you probably gave something

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
towards that problem as well,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
but somehow it doesn't happen

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
with the same intensity.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
So why is that?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Well, here is a thought experiment for you.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
maybe you're a politician in a developing country

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
How do you go about it?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Do you believe the people who tell you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that all we need to do is to spend money?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
That we know how to eradicate poverty,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
we just need to do more?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Or do you believe the people who tell you that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Or maybe you turn to the past.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Maybe you look at the past and see.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Has it done any good?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And, sadly, we don't know.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And worst of all, we will never know.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Africans have already got a lot of aid.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
These are the blue bars.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Okay, fine. How do you know what

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
would have happened without the aid?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Maybe it would have been much worse,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
or maybe it would have been better.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
There's only one Africa.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So what do you do?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Or do you focus on your everyday life

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and let the earthquake every eight days

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
continue to happen?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
The thing is, if we don't know

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
whether we are doing any good,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
we are not any better

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We don't know.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So here are some other questions.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
They're smaller questions,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
but they are not that small.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Immunization, that's the cheapest way

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
to save a child's life.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And the world has spent a lot of money on it:

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
The GAVI and the Gates Foundations

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
are each pledging a lot of money towards it,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And yet, every year

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
at least 25 million children

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
do not get the immunization they should get.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
So this is what you call a "last mile problem."

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
The technology is there,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
the infrastructure is there,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and yet it doesn't happen.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
So you have your million.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
How do you use your million

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
to solve this last mile problem?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And here's another question:

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Malaria. Malaria kills almost

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
900,000 people every year,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
most of them under five.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
We already know how to kill malaria,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but some people come to you and say,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Bed nets are very cheap.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
an insecticide treated bed net

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and you can teach someone to use them.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
but they have these great contagion benefits.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
If half of a community sleeps under a net,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
the other half also benefits

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
because the contagion of the disease spread.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Societies should be willing to go out

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and subsidize the net, give them for free,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
or, for that matter, pay people to use them

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
because of those contagion benefits.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
"Not so fast," say other people.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
"If you give the nets for free,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
people are not going to value them.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
They're not going to use them,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
maybe as fishing nets."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So, what do you do?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
or do you make people pay

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
in order to make sure that they really value them?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
How do you know?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And a third question: Education.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
But how do you do that?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Do you provide school lunch?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
How do you know?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So here is the thing.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I cannot answer the big question,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
whether aid did any good or not.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But these three questions, I can answer them.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
It's not the Middle Ages anymore,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
it's the 21st century.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And in the 20th century,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
randomized, controlled trials

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
have revolutionized medicine

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
by allowing us to distinguish

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
between drugs that work

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and drugs that don't work.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And you can do the same

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
randomized, controlled trial for social policy.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
You can put social innovation to the same

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
rigorous, scientific tests

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that we use for drugs.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And in this way, you can take the guesswork

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
out of policy-making

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
by knowing what works,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
what doesn't work and why.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So I start with immunization.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Well, when I started working there,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
about one percent of children

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
were fully immunized.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
That's bad, but there are places like that.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
they are there and they are free --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
The same child that is not immunized against measles,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
if they do get measles, parents will spend

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
thousands of rupees to help them.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So you get these empty village subcenters

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and crowded hospitals.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So what is the problem?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
After all, in this country as well,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
all sorts of myths and misconceptions

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
go around immunization.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So if that's the case, that's difficult,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
because persuasion is really difficult.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
But maybe there is another problem as well.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It's going from intention to action.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Imagine you are a mother

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this:

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
you will always tend to postpone and postpone,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and eventually it gets too late.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Because A, we can make it easy,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and B, we can maybe

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
give people a reason to act today,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
rather than wait till tomorrow.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So let's try them.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So the blue dots

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
are selected randomly.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
In the red dots, we made it easy

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and gave people a reason to act now.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
So we make it easy by organizing

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
this monthly camp where people can

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
get their kids immunized.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And then you make it easy

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and give a reason to act now

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
It's never going to convince anybody

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
to do something that they don't want to do.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
then it might give you a reason to act today

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
rather than later.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
So what do we find?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Well, beforehand, everything is the same.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
That's the beauty of randomization.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Afterwards,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
the camp -- just having the camp --

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
That's full immunization.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
That's not bad, that's a good improvement.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So here you've got your answer.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
you multiply immunization rate by six.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
We cannot keep giving lentils to people."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
because it is cheaper

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
to give lentils than not to give them.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
the cost per immunization

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
How about bed nets?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So the answer hinges

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
on the answer to three simple questions.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
One is: If people must pay for a bed net,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
are they going to purchase them?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
The second one is:

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
If I give bed nets for free,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
are people going to use them?

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And the third one is:

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The third one is important

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
because if we think people get used to handouts,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Now this is a debate that has generated

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It's more ideological than practical,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
but it turns out it's an easy question.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
We can know the answer to this question.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
We can just run an experiment.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
so I'm just going to talk to you about one.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And this one that was in Kenya,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
they went around and distributed to people

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
vouchers, discount vouchers.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
So people with their voucher

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And some people get 100 percent discount,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and some people get 20 percent discounts,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And now we can see what happens.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So, how about the purchasing?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Well, what you can see is that

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
when people have to pay for their bed nets,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
the coverage rate really falls down a lot.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
So even with partial subsidy,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
you lose the health immunity, that's not great.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Second thing is, how about the use?

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
If they get it for free, they use it.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
If they have to pay for it, they use it.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
How about the long term?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
In the long term,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
people who got the free bed nets,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
one year later, were offered the option

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
to purchase a bed net at two dollars.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
And people who got the free one

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
were actually more likely to purchase the second one

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
than people who didn't get a free one.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
So, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
But what politicians need is a range of options.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
what is the best way to achieve my goals?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
So what's the best?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Well, at some level, we think

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
all of these things should work.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
should we go for them?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Consider for example

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
transporting goods.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Before the canals were invented

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
in Britain before the Industrial Revolution,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
goods used to go on horse carts.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And then canals were built,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and with the same horseman and the same horse,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
you could carry ten times as much cargo.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
So should they have continued

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that they would eventually get there?

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Well, if that had been the case,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
there would have been no Industrial Revolution.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
In technology, we spend so much time

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
experimenting, fine-tuning,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
getting the absolute cheapest way to do something,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
so why aren't we doing that with social policy?

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Well, with experiments, what you can do

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
is answer a simple question.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
on various interventions.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
How many extra years of education

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
do you get for your hundred dollars?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Now I'm going to show you

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
what we get with various education interventions.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
hire teachers, school meals,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
school uniforms, scholarships.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
you get between one and three extra years of education.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
just because so many kids are already going to school

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
that you end up spending a lot of money.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And here are the most surprising results.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Tell people the benefits of education,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that's very cheap to do.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
you get 40 extra years of education.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And, in places where there are worms,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
intestinal worms,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
cure the kids of their worms.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And for every hundred dollars,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
you get almost 30 extra years of education.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
So this is not your intuition,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
this is not what people would have gone for,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and yet, these are the programs that work.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
We need that kind of information, we need more of it,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and then we need to guide policy.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And I cut it into smaller questions,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and I have the answer to these smaller questions.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And they are good, scientific, robust answers.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So let's go back to Haiti for a moment.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
In Haiti, about 200,000 people died --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And the response of the world was great:

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Two billion dollars got pledged just last month,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
for every child under five who dies,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
that would be 90 billion per year

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
just for that problem.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And yet it doesn't happen.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
So, why is that?

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Well, I think what part of the problem is that,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
in Haiti, although the problem is huge,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
somehow we understand it, it's localized.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
you give your money to Partners In Health,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and they'll helicopter things out and in.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And the problem of poverty is not like that.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
So, first, it's mostly invisible;

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
second, it's huge;

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
There's no silver bullet.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And that's very frustrating.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
But look what we just did today.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
I gave you three simple answers to three questions:

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Give lentils to immunize people,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
provide free bed nets, deworm children.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
With immunization or bed nets,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
With deworming, you can get

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
an extra year of education for three dollars.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
but we can get started.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And maybe we can get started small

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
with things that we know are effective.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
Here's an example of how this can be powerful.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Deworming.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
showed the numbers I gave you,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
they started Deworm the World.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And thanks to Deworm the World,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
and the effort of many country governments and foundations,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
So this evidence is powerful.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
It can prompt action.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
So we should get started now.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
It's not going to be easy.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
It's a very slow process.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
has to be trumped by practicality.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
So it's a slow process,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
but there is no other way.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
These economics I'm proposing,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
it's like 20th century medicine.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
It's a slow, deliberative process

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
of discovery.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
There is no miracle cure,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
but modern medicine is saving

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
millions of lives every year,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and we can do the same thing.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
And now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
that I started with at the beginning.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
I cannot tell you

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
but can we come back here in 30 years

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
and say, "What we have done,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
it really prompted a change for the better."

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
I believe we can and I hope we will.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Thank you.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
(Applause)
