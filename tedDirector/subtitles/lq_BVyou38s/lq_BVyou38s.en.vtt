Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.

00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:15.567
I've always had stage fright,

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.395
and not just a little bit,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.186
it's a big bit.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.979
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:24.537
That's when I started writing songs, and even then

00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:26.339
I only played them for myself.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.084
Just knowing my roommates were in the 
same house made me uncomfortable.

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:32.891
But after a couple of years, 
just writing songs wasn't enough.

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:35.910
I had all these stories and ideas,
and I wanted to share them with people,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.216
but physiologically, I couldn't do it.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:42.142
I had this irrational fear.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.301
But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,

00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.491
the more I wanted to perform.

00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.548
So on the week of my 30th birthday,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.501
I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.216
and put this fear behind me.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.073
Well, when I got there, it was packed.

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:57.047
There were like 20 people there.

00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.930
(Laughter)

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.537
And they all looked angry.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:05.138
But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:06.630
and I felt pretty good.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.691
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:15.155
when my whole body rebelled, and 
this wave of anxiety just washed over me.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.710
Now, when you experience fear, 
your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.553
So you have a rush of adrenaline, 
your heart rate increases,

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:23.006
your breathing gets faster.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:29.178
Next your non-essential systems start 
to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:32.542
So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed
away from your extremities,

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.142
so your fingers don't work anymore.

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:38.274
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,
your Spidey sense tingles,

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:43.448
basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
(Laughter)

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:48.231
That condition is not conducive 
to performing folk music.

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.800
(Laughter)

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.432
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:56.242
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:58.614
between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers

00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:00.685
on a Tuesday night open mic?

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.116
(Laughter)

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:06.173
I have never been more terrified -- until now.

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:12.004
(Laughter and cheers)

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:17.757
So then it was my turn,

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:20.843
and somehow, I get myself onto 
the stage, I start my song,

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:23.480
I open my mouth to sing the first line,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.443
and this completely horrible vibrato --

00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:27.930
you know, when your voice wavers -- 
comes streaming out.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.543
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, 
like an opera singer has,

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:33.237
this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:34.888
I mean, it's a nightmare.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.356
I'm embarrassed, the audience 
is clearly uncomfortable,

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.709
they're focused on my discomfort.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.484
It was so bad.

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:47.421
But that was my first real experience 
as a solo singer-songwriter.

00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:50.436
And something good did happen --
I had the tiniest little glimpse

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.919
of that audience connection that I was hoping for.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.927
And I wanted more. But I knew 
I had to get past this nervousness.

00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:00.097
That night I promised myself: 
I would go back every week

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.032
until I wasn't nervous anymore.

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:04.915
And I did. I went back every single week,

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:08.730
and sure enough, week after week,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.900
it didn't get any better. The same 
thing happened every week. (Laughter)

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.848
I couldn't shake it.

00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:16.521
And that's when I had an epiphany.

00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:22.532
And I remember it really well, because I 
don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)

00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:26.161
All I had to do was write a song 
that exploits my nervousness.

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:28.283
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:29.571
and the more nervous I was,

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:32.160
the better the song would be. Easy.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.989
So I started writing a song about having stage fright.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.050
First, fessing up to the problem,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.878
the physical manifestations, how I would feel,

00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:42.307
how the listener might feel.

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:44.915
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:47.847
and I knew I would be singing about a 
half-octave higher than normal,

00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:49.961
because I was nervous.

00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.033
By having a song that explained 
what was happening to me,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.520
while it was happening,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.383
that gave the audience permission to think about it.

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:59.144
They didn't have to feel bad 
for me because I was nervous,

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:00.862
they could experience that with me,

00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:06.111
and we were all one big happy, nervous, 
uncomfortable family. (Laughter)

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:10.920
By thinking about my audience, 
by embracing and exploiting my problem,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.855
I was able to take something 
that was blocking my progress,

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:17.792
and turn it into something that 
was essential for my success.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.812
And having the stage fright song let 
me get past that biggest issue

00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:22.630
right in the beginning of a performance.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.174
And then I could move on, 
and play the rest of my songs

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:27.428
with just a little bit more ease.

00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:33.704
And eventually, over time, I didn't 
have to play the stage fright song at all.

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:39.424
Except for when I was really 
nervous, like now. (Laughter)

00:04:40.945 --> 00:04:43.670
Would it be okay if I played the 
stage fright song for you?

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.662
(Applause)

00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:55.715
Can I have a sip of water?

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:59.666
(Music)

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:02.520
Thank you.

00:05:07.442 --> 00:05:10.363
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫

00:05:10.363 --> 00:05:15.991
♫ this stage fright is real. ♫

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:19.202
♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:23.548
♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫

00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:27.468
♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:31.396
♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:34.863
♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫

00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:37.909
♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.424
♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫

00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:41.825
(Laughter)

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:49.704
♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine 
you all without clothes. ♫

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:57.577
♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers
scares me more than anyone knows. ♫

00:05:57.577 --> 00:06:01.530
♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.775
♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:10.313
♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:15.203
♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:18.546
♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:25.814
♫ And you tell me, don't worry 
so much, you'll be great. ♫

00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:28.618
♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫

00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:30.936
♫ and I know how I get. ♫

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:35.080
♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.529
♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.361
♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't 
help me when I sing. ♫

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.249
♫ But we shouldn't talk about 
these things right now, ♫

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:54.136
♫ really, I'm up on stage, and 
you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫

00:06:54.136 --> 00:07:03.359
♫ And I'm not making fun of 
unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:06.275
♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:10.807
♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫

00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:15.945
♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫

00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:20.231
♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:24.194
♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:28.548
♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:32.315
♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫

00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:35.722
♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:44.085
♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫

00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:53.827
(Applause)
