00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:16.116
If you've been thinking about US politics

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.571
and trying to make sense of it
for the last year or so,

00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:24.286
you might have hit on something
like the following three propositions:

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.556
one, US partisanship
has never been so bad before;

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:32.588
two,

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:36.386
for the first time,
it's geographically spatialized --

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.357
we're divided between the coasts,
which want to look outwards,

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.498
and the center of the country,
which wants to look inwards;

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:44.801
and third,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.341
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.731
I'm here to today to say
that all three of these propositions,

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.759
all of which sound reasonable,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:55.997
are not true.

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:58.096
In fact,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.441
our US partisanship goes all the way back

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.997
to the very beginning of the republic.

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:10.330
It was geographically spatialized
in almost eerily the same way

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:11.647
that it is today,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.480
and it often has been
throughout US history.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.792
And last,

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:19.190
and by far most importantly,

00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:23.516
we actually have
an extraordinary mechanism

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.678
that's designed to help us manage
factional disagreement and partisanship.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:32.242
That technology is the Constitution.

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:38.975
And this is an evolving, subtly,
supplely designed entity

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.539
that has the specific purpose

00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:44.048
of teaching us how to manage
factional disagreement

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:45.966
where it's possible to do that,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.671
and giving us techniques
for overcoming that disagreement

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:51.006
when that's possible.

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.282
Now, in order to tell you the story,

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:58.570
I want to go back
to a pivotal moment in US history,

00:01:58.594 --> 00:01:59.749
and that is the moment

00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:03.320
when factional disagreement
and partisanship was born.

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:05.616
There actually was a birth moment --

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.851
a moment in US history
when partisanship snapped into place.

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:15.619
The person who's at the core
of that story is James Madison.

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:18.741
And at the moment that this began,

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.250
James Madison was riding high.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.471
He himself was the Einstein
of not only the US Constitution,

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.960
but of constitutional thought
more globally,

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:31.013
and, to give him his due,

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:32.242
he knew it.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:36.239
In a period of time of just three years,

00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:38.621
from 1785 to 1788,

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:45.044
he had conceived, theorized,
designed, passed and gotten ratified

00:02:45.068 --> 00:02:46.609
the US Constitution.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.870
And just to give you
some sense of the enormity

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:50.966
of what that accomplishment actually was,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.885
although Madison
couldn't have known it at the time,

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.220
today that same constitutional technology
that he invented is still in use

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:00.925
not only in the US,

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.433
but, 230 years later,

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:04.800
in places like Canada,

00:03:04.824 --> 00:03:06.644
India,

00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:08.191
South Africa,

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:09.813
Brazil.

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:12.717
So in an extraordinary range
of contexts all over the world,

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:14.821
this technology is still the dominant,

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:18.104
most used, most effective technology
to manage governance.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:21.757
In that moment,

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:25.353
Madison believed that,
having solved this problem,

00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:26.992
the country would run smoothly,

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:28.824
and that he had designed a technology

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:31.894
that would minimize
the results of factions

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:34.090
so there would be no political parties.

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.623
Remarkably, he thought
he had designed a constitution

00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:38.346
that was against political parties

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.296
and would make them unnecessary.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.226
He had gotten an enormous degree of help

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.093
in the final marketing phase
of his constitutional project

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:49.185
from a man you may have heard of,
called Alexander Hamilton.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.571
Now, Hamilton was everything
Madison was not.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:58.525
He was passionate,
where Madison was restrained.

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.397
He was pansexual,

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:03.261
where Madison didn't speak
to a woman expect for once

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.875
until he was 42 years old,

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.258
and then married Dolley
and lived happily ever after for 40 years.

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:10.179
(Laughter)

00:04:10.203 --> 00:04:11.363
To put it bluntly,

00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:12.794
Hamilton's the kind of person

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:15.047
about whom you would write
a hip-hop musical --

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.098
(Laughter)

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.710
and Madison is the kind of person

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:20.139
about whom you would not write
a hip-hop musical.

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:21.183
(Laughter)

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:23.207
Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all.

00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:25.361
But together,

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:27.457
they had become a rather unlikely pairing,

00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:29.530
and they had produced
the Federalist Papers,

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:31.626
which offered a justification

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.815
and, as I mentioned,

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.075
a marketing plan for the Constitution,

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.828
which had been wildly effective
and wildly successful.

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.119
Once the new government was in place,

00:04:42.143 --> 00:04:44.290
Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,

00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:47.004
and he had a very specific idea in mind.

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:48.181
And that was

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:51.176
to do for financial institutions
and infrastructure

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.665
exactly what Madison had done
for constitutions.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:57.664
Again, his contemporaries all knew it.

00:04:57.688 --> 00:04:59.522
One of them told Madison,

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:01.299
who can't have liked it very much,

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:04.467
that Hamilton was the Newton
of infrastructure.

00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:07.371
The idea was pretty straightforward.

00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:10.096
Hamilton would give
the United States a national bank,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.196
a permanent national debt --

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.428
he said it would be
"immortal," his phrase --

00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:23.066
and a manufacturing policy
that would enable trade and manufacturing

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.648
rather than agriculture,

00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:28.508
which was where the country's primary
wealth had historically been.

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:31.602
Madison went utterly ballistic.

00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:35.455
And in this pivotal, critical decision,

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.726
instead of just telling the world
that his old friend Hamilton was wrong

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.449
and was adopting the wrong policies,

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:44.235
he actually began to argue

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.360
that Hamilton's ideas
were unconstitutional --

00:05:47.384 --> 00:05:50.354
that they violated the very nature
of the Constitution

00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:52.603
that the two of them had drafted together.

00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:57.180
Hamilton responded
the way you would expect.

00:05:58.014 --> 00:06:03.075
He declared Madison to be
his "personal and political enemy" --

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.644
these are his words.

00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:08.627
So these two founders who had been
such close friends and such close allies

00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:09.893
and such partners,

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.863
then began to produce enmity.

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:15.850
And they did it in the good,
old-fashioned way.

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:17.720
First, they founded political parties.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:21.328
Madison created a party originally called
the Democratic Republican Party --

00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:22.562
"Republican" for short --

00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:25.421
and Hamilton created a party
called the Federalist Party.

00:06:26.313 --> 00:06:29.960
Those two parties adopted
positions on national politics

00:06:29.984 --> 00:06:32.701
that were extreme and exaggerated.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.459
To give you a clear example:

00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:36.031
Madison, who had always believed

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:39.144
that the country would have
some manufacturing and some trade

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:40.738
and some agriculture,

00:06:40.762 --> 00:06:42.970
began attacking Hamilton

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:46.368
as a kind of tool of the financial markets

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:52.055
whom Hamilton himself intended
to put in charge of the country.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.820
That was an overstatement,

00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:55.964
but it was something
Madison came to believe.

00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:57.857
He also attacked city life,

00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:00.686
and he said that the coasts were corrupt,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.341
and what people needed to do
was to look inwards

00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:05.078
to the center of the country,

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:08.915
to farmers, who were the essence
of Republican virtue,

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:12.271
and they should go back to the values
that had made American great,

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.633
specifically the values of the Revolution,

00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:18.158
and those were the values of low taxes,

00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:19.343
agriculture

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.627
and less trade.

00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:25.908
Hamilton responded to this
by saying that Madison was naïve,

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:28.076
that he was childish,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.541
and that his goal was
to turn the United States

00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:32.360
into a primitive autarchy,

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:36.219
self-reliant and completely ineffectual
on the global scale.

00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:37.754
(Laughter)

00:07:37.778 --> 00:07:39.483
They both meant it,

00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:41.862
and there was some truth
to each of their claims,

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:46.228
because each side was grossly exaggerating
the views of the other

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:48.098
in order to fight their war.

00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:50.855
They founded newspapers,

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.824
and so for the first time in US history,

00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:57.808
the news that people received
came entirely through the lens

00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:00.462
of either the Republican
or the Federalist party.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.283
How does this end?

00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:09.305
Well, as it turned out,
the Constitution did its work.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.819
But it did its work in surprising ways

00:08:12.843 --> 00:08:16.946
that Madison himself
had not fully anticipated.

00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:20.558
First, there was a series of elections.

00:08:21.058 --> 00:08:23.649
And the first two times out of the box,

00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:27.514
the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.910
Madison was astonished.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:33.478
Of course, he blamed the press.

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:35.840
(Laughter)

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:38.163
And in a rather innovative view --

00:08:38.187 --> 00:08:41.373
Madison never failed to innovate
when he thought about anything --

00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:44.062
he said the reason
that the press was so pro-Federalist

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:47.461
is that the advertisers
were all Federalists,

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:52.212
because they were traders on the coasts
who got their capital from Britain,

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:54.199
which Federalism was in bed with.

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:57.274
That was his initial explanation.

00:08:58.052 --> 00:09:00.100
But despite the fact that the Federalists,

00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:01.275
once in power,

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:06.524
actually enacted laws that criminalized
criticism of the government --

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:08.421
that happened in the United States --

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.331
nevertheless,

00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:13.042
the Republicans fought back,

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:16.369
and Madison began to emphasize
the freedom of speech,

00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:18.881
which he had built
into the Bill of Rights,

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:21.040
and the capacity of civil society

00:09:21.064 --> 00:09:22.430
to organize.

00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:25.076
And sure enough, nationally,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.463
small local groups -- they were called
Democratic-Republican Societies --

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:34.132
began to form and protest
against Federalist-dominated hegemony.

00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:40.193
Eventually, the Republicans managed
to win a national election --

00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:41.676
that was in 1800.

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:44.625
Madison became the Secretary of State,

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:47.339
his friend and mentor Jefferson
became president,

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:49.585
and they actually, over time,

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:54.064
managed to put the Federalists
completely out of business.

00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:55.771
That was their goal.

00:09:57.646 --> 00:09:59.599
Now, why did that happen?

00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:04.309
It happened because in the structure
of the Constitution

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:08.093
were several features
that actually managed faction

00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:10.647
the way there were supposed to do
in the first place.

00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:11.926
What were those?

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:14.611
One -- most important of all --

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:16.449
the freedom of speech.

00:10:16.473 --> 00:10:18.630
This was an innovative idea at the time.

00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:20.913
Namely, that if you were out of power,

00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:23.695
you could still say
that the government was terrible.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.940
Two,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.472
civil society organization.

00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:32.985
The capacity to put together
private groups, individuals,

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:34.616
political parties and others

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.773
who would organize to try to bring
about fundamental change.

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:43.950
Perhaps most significantly
was the separation of powers --

00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:46.453
an extraordinary component
of the Constitution.

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:48.907
The thing about the separation of powers

00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.405
is that it did then and it does now,

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:54.938
drive governance to the center.

00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:59.258
You can get elected to office
in the United States

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.250
with help from the periphery,

00:11:01.274 --> 00:11:02.554
right or left.

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.556
It turns out,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.919
you actually can't govern
unless you bring on board the center.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.518
There are midterm elections
that come incredibly fast

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:16.471
after a presidency begins.

00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:20.080
Those drive presidents towards the center.

00:11:20.988 --> 00:11:25.293
There's a structure in which
the president, in fact, does not rule

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:26.728
or even govern,

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:30.797
but can only propose laws
which other people have to agree with --

00:11:31.392 --> 00:11:33.974
another feature that tends
to drive presidents

00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:35.756
who actually want to get things done

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.970
to the center.

00:11:37.373 --> 00:11:41.605
And a glance at the newspapers today
will reveal to you

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:45.421
that these principles are still
completely in operation.

00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.301
No matter how a president gets elected,

00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:51.103
the president cannot get anything done

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:55.511
unless the president first of all
follows the rules of the Constitution,

00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:56.691
because if not,

00:11:56.715 --> 00:12:00.012
the courts will stand up,
as indeed has sometimes occurred,

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.896
not only recently,
but in the past, in US history.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.073
And furthermore,

00:12:04.097 --> 00:12:05.667
the president needs people,

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:08.763
elected officials who know
they need to win election

00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:10.232
from centrist voters,

00:12:10.256 --> 00:12:14.481
also to back his or her policies
in order to pass laws.

00:12:15.382 --> 00:12:17.957
Without it, nothing much happens.

00:12:19.685 --> 00:12:23.257
The takeaway of this brief excursus

00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:27.431
into the history of partisanship,
then, is the following:

00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:30.963
partisanship is real;

00:12:31.868 --> 00:12:33.282
it's profound;

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:36.261
it's extraordinarily powerful,

00:12:36.285 --> 00:12:38.075
and it's terribly upsetting.

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:45.002
But the design of the Constitution
is greater than partisanship.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.531
It enables us to manage partisanship
when that's possible,

00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:56.531
and it enables us actually
to overcome partisan division

00:12:56.555 --> 00:12:58.203
and produce compromise,

00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:00.472
when and only when that is possible.

00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:06.405
A technology like that
is a technology that worked

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:08.146
for the founders,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.611
it worked for their grandchildren,

00:13:11.904 --> 00:13:14.112
it didn't work at the moment
of the Civil War,

00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:16.050
but then it started working again.

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:18.786
And it worked for our grandparents,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.364
our parents,

00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:23.806
and it's going to work for us.

00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:29.744
(Applause)

00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:32.647
So what you should do is really simple.

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:35.322
Stand up for what you believe in,

00:13:36.207 --> 00:13:39.413
support the organizations
that you care about,

00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:42.274
speak out on the issues
that matter to you,

00:13:43.245 --> 00:13:45.076
get involved,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.615
make change,

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.534
express you opinion,

00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:52.409
and do it with respect
and knowledge and confidence

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:55.287
that it's only by working together

00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:59.882
that the constitutional technology
can do the job that it is designed to do.

00:14:00.817 --> 00:14:02.510
Stand up for what you believe,

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:04.633
but take a deep breath while you do it.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.233
It's going to be OK.

00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:10.246
Thanks.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.924
(Applause)
