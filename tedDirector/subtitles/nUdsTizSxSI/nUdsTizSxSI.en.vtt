00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I want to talk to you today a little bit

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
about predictable irrationality.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And my interest in irrational behavior

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
started many years ago in the hospital.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I was burned very badly.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.330
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
and you must have wondered what's the right approach.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
which one of those is the right approach?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
and they would grab hold and they would rip.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
And as you can imagine,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And I would try to reason with them and say,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.330
"Why don't we try something else?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
Why don't we take it a little longer --

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And the nurses told me two things.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.330
They told me that they had the right model of the patient --

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
to make suggestions or to interfere or ...

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
and they kept on doing what they were doing.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
And about three years later, when I left the hospital,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
I started studying at the university.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
was that there is an experimental method

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
maybe learn something about the world.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
So that's what I did.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.330
I was still interested

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
So originally I didn't have much money,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.330
so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and I would crunch it a little bit.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
(Laughter)

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
and pain that went up and pain that went down,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
Or, if you had to choose between the last two,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
which one would you choose?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
(Laughter)

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
I kept on doing this for a while.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
(Laughter)

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.330
I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
But at the end of this process,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Here were wonderful people with good intentions

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and plenty of experience, and nevertheless

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
It turns out that because we don't encode duration

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
in the way that we encode intensity,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.330
I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
and the intensity was lower.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
giving me a trend of improvement over time --

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.330
that would have been also less painful.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
And it also turns out that it would have been good

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
All of these would have been great things to do,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
and my nurses had no idea.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.330
And from that point on I started thinking,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And it turns out it's a more general case --

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
there's a lot of mistakes we do.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
and I want to talk to you about cheating.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
but also it tells us something, I think,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
about the stock market situation we're in.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
So, my interest in cheating started

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and I started thinking about what is happening here.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Is it the case that there was kind of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
a few apples who are capable of doing these things,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
or are we talking a more endemic situation,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.330
And here's how it went.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
but I wouldn't give you enough time.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
on average people would solve four problems.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
Other people I would tempt to cheat.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
I would pass their sheet of paper.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.330
"Please shred the piece of paper.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
and tell me how many questions you got correctly."

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
People now solved seven questions on average.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
a few people cheated a lot.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Now, in economic theory,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
You say, what's the probability of being caught?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
And you weigh these options out --

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
So, we try to test this.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.330
how much money they could steal.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
What about the probability of being caught?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.330
so there was some evidence left.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.330
So we said, "If people are not sensitive

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.330
to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
what could be going on?"

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
and still feel good about ourselves.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.330
So, maybe what is happening is that

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
there's a level of cheating we can't go over,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
We call this like a personal fudge factor.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.330
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.330
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
So, we got people to the lab, and we said,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
"We have two tasks for you today."

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
First, we asked half the people

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
to recall either 10 books they read in high school,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
or to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and then we tempted them with cheating.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
It wasn't that the more religious people --

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.330
the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
and the less religious people --

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
cheated more.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.330
they stopped cheating.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.330
the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
they don't cheat at all.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
to bring into the education system, so we said,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
So, we got people to sign,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.330
"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And this is particularly interesting,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
because MIT doesn't have an honor code.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.330
(Laughter)

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
What about increasing the fudge factor?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
And I came back to measure what we technically call

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.330
No bill ever disappeared.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Now, this is not a good social science experiment,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
so to do it better I did the same experiment

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
as I described to you before.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.330
they came to us and said,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
they came to us and said,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:48.330
"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
and exchanged it for dollars.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Think about the following intuition.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
compared to how bad would you feel

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
These things feel very differently.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
by being paid by token make a difference?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
Our subjects doubled their cheating.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
I'll tell you what I think

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
about this and the stock market in a minute.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
because in Enron, there's also a social element.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.330
People see each other behaving.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
In fact, every day when we open the news

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
we see examples of people cheating.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
What does this cause us?

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.330
So, we did another experiment.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.330
and we prepaid them.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and we told them that at the end, we asked them

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.330
to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.330
The same thing happens.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
"I solved everything. What do I do now?"

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.330
That's it. The task is finished."

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
So, now we had a student -- an acting student --

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
that was a part of the group.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
Nobody knew it was an actor.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.330
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
What would happen to the other people in the group?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
Here is what happens.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.330
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
Here is the thing.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
were Carnegie Mellon students.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.330
but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.330
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
cheating went down.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
(Laughter)

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
Now, this is important, because remember,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
when the moment the student stood up,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
because the experimenter said,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
It was about the norms for cheating.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.330
we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
I mean, not terrible in this --

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
from another university, another group,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.330
and people cheat even less.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.330
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
They cheat just by a little bit.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.330
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
When we get bigger distance from cheating,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
And when we see cheating around us,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.330
think about what happens.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
What happens in a situation when you create something

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
where you pay people a lot of money

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
to see reality in a slightly distorted way?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
Would they not be able to see it this way?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.330
Of course they would.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.330
What happens when you do other things,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
like you remove things from money?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.330
mortgage-backed securities.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
Could it be that with those more distant things,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
it's not a token for one second,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
it's something that is many steps removed from money

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
And what happens to the social environment

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
when people see other people behave around them?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
in the stock market.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
More generally, I want to tell you something

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
about behavioral economics.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
We have many intuitions in our life,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
in our private life, in our business life,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
and most particularly when it goes to policy,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
taxation, health care and so on.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
And the difficulty of testing our intuition

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
was the big lesson I learned

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
So I went back to talk to them

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
And I learned two interesting things.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.330
told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
But think about me as a nurse,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.330
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.330
"I did not think that your intuition was right.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.330
I felt my intuition was correct."

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
So, if you think about all of your intuitions,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.330
it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
she thought her intuition was right --

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.330
it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
to try and check whether she was wrong.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.330
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
our own ability, how the economy works,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
how we should pay school teachers.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
But unless we start testing those intuitions,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
we're not going to do better.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
And just think about how better my life would have been

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.330
and how everything would have been better

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:04.330
if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
Thank you very much.
