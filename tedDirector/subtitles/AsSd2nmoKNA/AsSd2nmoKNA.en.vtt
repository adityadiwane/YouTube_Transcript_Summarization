00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
This room may appear

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
to be holding 600 people,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but there's actually so many more,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
because in each one of us

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
there is a multitude of personalities.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I have two primary personalities

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that have been in conflict and conversation within me

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
since I was a little girl.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I call them "the mystic"

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and "the warrior."

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I was born into a family

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
of politically active,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
intellectual atheists.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
There was this equation in my family that went something like this:

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
if you are intelligent,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
you therefore are not spiritual.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I was the freak of the family.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I was this weird little kid

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
who wanted to have deep talks

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
about the worlds that might exist

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I wanted to know

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
if what we human beings see

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and hear and think

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
is a full and accurate picture

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
of reality.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
So, looking for answers,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I went to Catholic mass.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I tagged along with my neighbors.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I read Sartre and Socrates.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And then a wonderful thing happened

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
when I was in high school:

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Gurus from the East

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
started washing up on the shores of America.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And I said to myself,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
"I wanna get me one of them."

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And ever since,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
I've been walking the mystic path,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
trying to peer beyond

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
what Albert Einstein called

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
"the optical delusion

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
of everyday consciousness."

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Take a breath right now

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
of this clear air in this room.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Now, see this strange,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
underwater,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
coral reef-looking thing?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
It's actually a person's trachea,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and those colored globs

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
are microbes

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that are actually swimming around in this room

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
right now, all around us.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
If we're blind to this simple biology,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
imagine what we're missing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
at the smallest subatomic level right now

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and at the grandest cosmic levels.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
My years as a mystic

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
have made me question

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
almost all my assumptions.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Now when the mystic part of me

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
jabbers on and on like this,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the warrior rolls her eyes.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
She's concerned

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
about what's happening in this world right now.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
She's worried.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and I know a few things,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and we better get busy about them right now."

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I've spent my life as a warrior,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
working for women's issues,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
working on political campaigns,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
being an activist for the environment.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And it can be sort of crazy-making,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
housing both the mystic and the warrior

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
in one body.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I've always been attracted

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
to those rare people

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
who pull that off,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
who devote their lives to humanity

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
with the grit of the warrior

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and the grace of the mystic --

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
people like Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
who wrote, "I can never be

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
what I ought to be

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
until you are

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
what you ought to be.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
of reality."

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
who said, "The problem with the world

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
is that we draw the circle of our family

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
too small."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And Nelson Mandela,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
who lives by the African concept

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
of "ubuntu,"

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
which means "I need you

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
in order to be me,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and you need me in order to be you."

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Now we all love to trot out

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
these three mystic warriors

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
as if they were born

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
with the saint gene.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
But we all actually have

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
the same capacity that they do,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and we need to do

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
their work now.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I'm deeply disturbed

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
by the ways in which all of our cultures

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
are demonizing "the Other"

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
by the voice we're giving

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
to the most divisive among us.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Listen to these titles

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
of some of the bestselling books

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
from both sides of the political divide

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
here in the U.S.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,"

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,"

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
"Pinheads and Patriots,"

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
"Arguing With Idiots."

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
but they're actually dangerous.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Now here's a title that may sound familiar,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
but whose author may surprise you:

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Against Lies, Stupidity

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and Cowardice."

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Who wrote that?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
That was Adolf Hitler's first title

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
for "Mein Kampf" -- "My Struggle" --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
the book that launched the Nazi party.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
The worst eras in human history,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
whether in Cambodia or Germany

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
or Rwanda,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
they start like this, with negative other-izing.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And then they morph

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
into violent extremism.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
This is why I'm launching a new initiative.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And it's to help all of us,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
myself included,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
to counteract the tendency

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
to "otherize."

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And I realize we're all busy people,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I'm calling my initiative,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
"Take the Other to Lunch."

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
If you are

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
a Republican,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
you can take a Democrat to lunch,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
or if you're a Democrat,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
think of it

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
as taking a Republican to lunch.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
makes you lose your appetite,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
I suggest you start more local,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
because there is no shortage of the Other

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
right in your own neighborhood.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Maybe that person

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
who worships at the mosque,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
or the church or the synagogue, down the street.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Or someone from the other side

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
of the abortion conflict.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Or maybe your brother-in-law

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
who doesn't believe in global warming.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
or whose point of view

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
makes smoke come out of your ears.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
A couple of weeks ago,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
She's an activist from the Right,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and I'm an activist from the Left.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And we used some guidelines

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to keep our conversation elevated,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
and you can use them too,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
because I know you're all going

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
to take an Other to lunch.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
So first of all, decide on a goal:

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
to get to know one person

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And then, before you get together,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
agree on some ground rules.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
My Tea Party lunchmate and I

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
came up with these:

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
don't persuade, defend

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
or interrupt.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Be curious;

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
be conversational; be real.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And listen.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
From there, we dove in.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And we used these questions:

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Share some of your life experiences with me.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
What issues

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
deeply concern you?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And what have you always wanted to ask

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
someone from the other side?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
My lunch partner and I

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
came away with some really important insights,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
and I'm going to share just one with you.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
I think it has relevance

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
to any problem

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
between people anywhere.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I asked her why her side

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
makes such outrageous allegations

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and lies about my side.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
"What?" she wanted to know.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
"Like we're a bunch

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
of elitist,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Well, she was shocked.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
She thought my side

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
beat up on her side way more often,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
that we called them brainless,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
gun-toting racists,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and we both marveled

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
at the labels that fit

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
none of the people

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
we actually know.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And since we had established some trust,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
we believed in each other's sincerity.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
when we witnessed

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
the kind of "otherizing" talk

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that can wound

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and fester into paranoia

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and then be used by those on the fringes

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
to incite.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
By the end of our lunch,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
we acknowledged each other's openness.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Neither of us had tried to change the other.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
But we also hadn't pretended

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
that our differences were just going to melt away

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
after a lunch.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Instead, we had taken

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
first steps together,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
past our knee-jerk reactions,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
to the ubuntu place,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
which is the only place

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
where solutions

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.260
to our most intractable-seeming problems

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
will be found.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Who should you invite to lunch?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Next time you catch yourself

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
in the act of otherizing,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that will be your clue.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And what might happen at your lunch?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Will the heavens open

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and "We Are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Probably not.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Because ubuntu work is slow,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and it's difficult.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
It's two people

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
dropping the pretense

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
of being know-it-alls.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
It's two people,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
two warriors,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
dropping their weapons

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and reaching toward each other.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
"Out beyond ideas

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
of wrong-doing and right-doing,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
there is a field.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I'll meet you there."

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:02.260
(Applause)
