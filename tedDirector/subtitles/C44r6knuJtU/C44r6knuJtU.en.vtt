00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.071
As a little Hawaiian,

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:17.477
my mom and auntie always told me
stories about Kalaupapa --

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:18.822
the Hawaiian leper colony

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.673
surrounded by the highest
sea cliffs in the world --

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:23.109
and Father Damien,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.561
the Belgian missionary who gave his life
for the Hawaiian community.

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:28.465
As a young nurse,

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.430
my aunt trained the nuns
caring for the remaining lepers

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:34.731
almost a 100 years after
Father Damien died of leprosy.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.172
I remember stories she told

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:41.148
about traveling down
switchback cliff paths on a mule,

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.303
while my uncle played
her favorite hula songs on the ukulele

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:46.004
all the way down to Kalaupapa.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.231
You see, as a youngster,

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:50.191
I was always curious about a few things.

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:55.731
First was why a Belgian missionary
chose to live in complete isolation

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.945
in Kalaupapa,

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.199
knowing he would inevitably
contract leprosy

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:01.603
from the community of people
he sought to help.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.593
And secondly,

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.978
where did the leprosy bacteria come from?

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.757
And why were Kānaka Maoli,

00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:11.030
the indigenous people of Hawaii,

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:15.416
so susceptible to developing
leprosy, or "mai Pake?"

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:19.583
This got my curious about what
makes us unique as Hawaiians --

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:21.448
namely, our genetic makeup.

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:24.908
But it wasn't until high school,

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:26.544
through the Human Genome Project,

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:28.767
that I realized I wasn't alone

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.619
in trying to connect
our unique genetic ancestry

00:01:31.643 --> 00:01:35.325
to our potential health,
wellness and illness.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.211
You see,

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.034
the 2.7 billion-dollar project

00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:43.048
promised an era of predictive
and preventative medicine

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:45.485
based on our unique genetic makeup.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.525
So to me it always seemed obvious

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.277
that in order to achieve this dream,

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:54.314
we would need to sequence
a diverse cohort of people

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:57.742
to obtain the full spectrum
of human genetic variation on the planet.

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:00.875
That's why 10 years later,

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.573
it continues to shock me,

00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:05.811
knowing that 96 percent of genome studies

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:09.415
associating common genetic variation
with specific diseases

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.240
have focused exclusively
on individuals of European ancestry.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.478
Now you don't need a PhD

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:18.535
to see that that leaves four percent
for the rest of diversity.

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:21.292
And in my own searching,

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:23.825
I've discovered that far less
than one percent

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.923
have actually focused on indigenous
communities, like myself.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.528
So that begs the question:

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.099
Who is the Human Genome
Project actually for?

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:35.211
Just like we have
different colored eyes and hair,

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:36.743
we metabolize drugs differently

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:38.634
based on the variation in our genomes.

00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:42.415
So how many of you
would be shocked to learn

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.221
that 95 percent of clinical trials

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:49.661
have also exclusively featured
individuals of European ancestry?

00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.722
This bias

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:55.587
and systematic lack of engagement
of indigenous people

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.595
in both clinical trials
and genome studies

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.559
is partially the result
of a history of distrust.

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:04.043
For example,

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:07.996
in 1989, researchers
from Arizona State University

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.586
obtained blood samples
from Arizona's Havasupai tribe,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.544
promising to alleviate the burden
of type 2 diabetes

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:16.428
that was plaguing their community,

00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:20.337
only to turn around and use
those exact same samples --

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:22.064
without the Havasupai's consent --

00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:25.593
to study rates
of schizophrenia, inbreeding,

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:28.592
and challenge
the Havasupai's origin story.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.861
When the Havasupai found out,

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.078
they sued successfully for $700,000,

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:40.445
and they banned ASU from conducting
research on their reservation.

00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.215
This culminated in a sort of domino effect

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.001
with local tribes in the Southwest --

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.454
including the Navajo Nation,

00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:49.565
one of the largest
tribes in the country --

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.836
putting a moratorium on genetic research.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.741
Now despite this history of distrust,

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:59.240
I still believe that indigenous people
can benefit from genetic research.

00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.509
And if we don't do something soon,

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.400
the gap in health disparities
is going to continue to widen.

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.518
Hawaii, for example,

00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:10.249
has the longest life expectancy
on average of any state in the US,

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:13.130
yet native Hawaiians like myself

00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:16.240
die a full decade
before our non-native counterparts,

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:20.315
because we have some
of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.490
obesity,

00:04:21.514 --> 00:04:24.039
and the number one and number
two killers in the US:

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.902
cardiovascular disease and cancer.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.645
So how do we ensure

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.820
the populations of people
that need genome sequencing the most

00:04:30.844 --> 00:04:32.264
are not the last to benefit?

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:37.394
My vision is to make
genetic research more native,

00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:39.829
to indigenize genome
sequencing technology.

00:04:40.902 --> 00:04:43.933
Traditionally, genomes
are sequenced in laboratories.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:47.143
Here's an image of your classic
genome sequencer.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.318
It's huge.

00:04:48.342 --> 00:04:50.094
It's the size of a refrigerator.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.817
There's this obvious physical limitation.

00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.440
But what if you could sequence
genomes on the fly?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.511
What if you could fit a genome
sequencer in your pocket?

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:06.246
This nanopore-based sequencer

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.755
is one 10,000th the size
of your traditional genome sequencer.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.000
It doesn't have the same
physical limitations,

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:17.300
in that it's not tethered to a lab bench
with extraneous cords,

00:05:17.324 --> 00:05:19.849
large vats of chemicals
or computer monitors.

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:25.607
It allows us to de-black box genome
sequencing technology development

00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:28.243
in a way that's immersive
and collaborative,

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:31.005
activating and empowering
indigenous communities ...

00:05:32.476 --> 00:05:33.917
as citizen scientists.

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:37.648
100 years later in Kalaupapa,

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:41.911
we now have the technology to sequence
leprosy bacteria in real time,

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:44.823
using mobile genome sequencers,

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.856
remote access to the Internet

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.292
and cloud computation.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.028
But only if that's what
Hawaiian people want.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:55.370
In our space,

00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:56.844
on our terms.

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:04.172
IndiGenomics is about science
for the people by the people.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:08.141
We'll be starting with a tribal
consultation resource,

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:11.376
focused on educating
indigenous communities

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.419
on the potential use and misuse
of genetic information.

00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:18.171
Eventually we'd like to have our own
IndiGenomics research institute

00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:19.624
to conduct our own experiments

00:06:19.648 --> 00:06:22.783
and educate the next generation
of indigenous scientists.

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:25.084
In the end,

00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:29.700
indigenous people need to be partners in
and not subjects of genetic research.

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:32.132
And for those on the outside,

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.640
just as Father Damien did,

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:38.983
the research community needs
to immerse itself in indigenous culture

00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:40.960
or die trying.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.189
Mahalo.

00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:47.213
(Applause)
