00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm here today

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
to start a revolution.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Now before you get up in arms,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
or you break into song,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
or you pick a favorite color,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I want to define what I mean by revolution.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
By revolution,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I mean a drastic and far-reaching change

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
in the way we think and behave --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
the way we think and the way we behave.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
We need a revolution

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
because things aren't working; they're just not working.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And that makes me really sad

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
because I'm sick and tired of things not working.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I'm sick and tired of us being last.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And we are last place in so many things --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
for example, social factors.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
We're last place in Europe in innovation.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We're last place in health care,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and that's important for a sense of well-being.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And worst of all,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
We're the saddest place on Earth,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
relative to GDP per capita --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
the saddest place on Earth.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
That's social. Let's look at education.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Where do we rank three weeks ago

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
in another report by the OECD?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Last in reading, math and science. Last.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Business:

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The lowest perception in the E.U.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Why as a result, what happens?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And this is despite the fact

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that everybody knows that small business

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is the engine of economies.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So if our engine's broken, guess what?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Last in Europe GDP per capita.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Last.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are not optimistic about the future.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
We're unhappy, we have bad education,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and we have the worst businesses.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And these are facts, guys.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
It's not.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So I think it should be really, really clear

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that our system is broken.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The way we think, the way we behave,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
our operating system of behaving is broken.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to transform Bulgaria for the better,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
for ourselves, for our friends,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
for our family and for our future.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
How did this happen?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I think we're last because --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and this is going to be drastic to some of you --

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
because we are handicapping ourselves.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
We're holding ourselves back

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
because we don't value play.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I said "play," all right.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Babies play, kids play,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
adults play.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
We don't value play.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
In fact, we devalue play.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And we devalue it in three areas.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Let's go back to the same three areas.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Social: 45 years of what?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Of communism --

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
of valuing the society and the state over the individual

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and squashing, inadvertently,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And instead, what do we value?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Because it's shown

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the way we apply, generate and use knowledge

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
is affected by our social and institutional context,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
which told us what in communism?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
To be serious.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
To be really, really serious.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
It did.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
(Applause)

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Be serious.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
for letting my kids play on the ground.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I have been told by babas and dyados

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
that we shouldn't let our kids play so much

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
because life is serious

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
We have a serious meme running through.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It's a social gene running through us.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It's a serious gene.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
It's 45 years of it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
that's created what I call the "baba factor."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
(Laughter)

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
(Applause)

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And here's how it works.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
But then what happens in step three?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I want to go back to work

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
I'm going to give bebko to baba.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
But we need to remember

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
So what happens?

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
She passes that virus on to baby,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
for that serious meme

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
to get out of our operating system.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
What happens then?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
that has little changed for 100 years,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
that values rote learning,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
memorization and standardization,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and devalues self-expression, self-exploration,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
questioning, creativity and play.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It's a crap system.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.260
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
We went to this prestigious little school

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and science eight times a week

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and reading five times a day and all this stuff.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
(Laughter)

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And we said, "He's five."

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
What a crime. What a crime.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And it's a crime

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
that our education system is so serious because education is serious

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that we're creating mindless, robotic workers

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
But I'm sorry, the problems of today

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
We need adaptability,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
We don't need mechanized workers.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to lever and just throw away.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Autocratic --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
do what I say because I'm the chef.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
I'm the boss and I know better than you.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
(Laughter)

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Controlling --

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
don't be on I.M.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and you're not having any fun.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
In social, in education and in our business,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
don't value play.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And that's why we're last,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
because we don't value play.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It can't be because of play.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Just play, that's a stupid thing."

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
We have the serious meme in us.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Well I'm going to say no.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Play:

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
our brains

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
are hardwired for play.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Evolution has selected,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
over millions and billions of years,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
for play in animals and in humans.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And you know what?

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Evolution does a really, really good job

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
and selecting traits for competitive advantage.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Throughout the animal kingdom, for example:

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
ants. Ants play.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Maybe you didn't know that.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
But when they're playing,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Rats play, but what you might not have known

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
is that rats that play more

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
have bigger brains

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and they learn tasks better,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
skills.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
But what you may not know

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
is that kittens deprived of play

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
are unable to interact socially.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Bears play.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
But what you may not know

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is that bears that play more survive longer.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
It's the ones that play more.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And a final really interesting study --

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
it's been shown, a correlation

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
between play and brain size.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
But who do you think

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
with the biggest brains are the biggest players?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Yours truly: humans.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Kids play, we play --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of every nationality, of every race,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
of every color, of every religion.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
It's a universal thing -- we play.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Really cool term: neoteny --

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And who are the biggest neotenists?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Humans. We play sports.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
We play musical instruments.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
We dance, we kiss, we sing,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
we just goof around.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
We're designed by nature to play

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
from birth to old age.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We're designed to do that continuously --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to play and play a lot

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and not stop playing.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
It is a huge benefit.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Just like there's benefits to animals,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
there's benefits to humans.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
For example, it's been shown

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in the area where it controls emotions.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
where a lot of cognition is happening.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
As a result, what happens?

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
We develop better decision-making ability

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
if we play more.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
These guys are facts.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
it's cold, hard science.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
These are the benefits to play.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
It is a genetic birthright that we have,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
like walking or speaking or seeing.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And if we handicap ourselves with play,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
we handicap ourselves

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
as if we would with any other birthright that we have.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
We hold ourselves back.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Little exercise just for a second:

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
close your eyes

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and try to imagine a world without play.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
without song, without dancing,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
without soccer, without football,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
without laughter.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
What does this world look like?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
It's pretty bleak.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It's pretty glum.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Now imagine your workplace.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
We have this concept

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
that the opposite of play is work.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
He's going to think I'm not working hard."

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The opposite of play

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
is not work.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
The opposite of play

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
is depression. It's depression.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
In fact,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
play improves our work.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
there's benefits for play at work.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
For example, it stimulates creativity.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
It increases our openness to change.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It improves our ability to learn.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery --

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
two key motivational things

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
that increase productivity,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
through play.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
play doesn't mean frivolous.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
he's serious about it, but he loves it.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
A doctor might be serious,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
but laughter's still a great medicine.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Our thinking is backwards.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
We should be celebrating play.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Quick example from the corporate world.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
What happens? They give better service --

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
not worse, but better.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
And when customers call for service

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
how do the customers feel? They feel great.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
which leads to more profit.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
People, service, profit.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Play increases productivity, not decreases.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And you're going to say,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
but it can't work in Bulgaria.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
No way. We're different."

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
One, play is universal.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Not one customer would refer us.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
I asked them all.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
We had marginal profit -- I did.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
We had marginal profits,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and we had unhappy stakeholders.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Through some basic change,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
change like improving transparency,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
change like promoting self-direction

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and collaboration, encouraging collaboration,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
not autocracy,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
the things like having a results-focus.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I care that your customer and your team is happy

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and you're organized with that.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Basically promoting fun.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Through promoting fun and a great environment,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
we were able to transform Sciant

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and, in just three short years --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
sounds like a long time, but change is slow --

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
above average profits for the industry

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and happy stakeholders.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Well we did win, every year that we entered,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
one of the rankings for best employer for small business.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Independent analysis from anonymous employees

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
on their surveys.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
There's nothing holding us back,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
except our own mentality about play.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up --

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
how to make this revolution through play.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
First of all, you have to believe me.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
If you don't believe me,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
well just go home and think about it some more or something.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
you need to rediscover play.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
that you enjoyed only six months ago,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
because you feel like you have to be serious,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
rediscover it.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Rediscover that

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
because you're the leaders,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
You're the ones that have to go back to the office

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
or talk to your friends

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
I'm going to let you challenge authority.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
and create innovative solutions

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
to problems of today.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
We're not always right as leaders.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
We're going to eradicate fear.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
Fear is the enemy of play.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And we're going to do things

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
like eliminate restrictions.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
You know what, let them use their mobile phone

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
for personal calls -- heaven forbid.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Let them be on the Internet.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Let them be on instant messengers.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Let them take long lunches.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
Lunch is like the recess for work.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
It's when you go out in the world

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
you have a beer, you have some food, you talk,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
you get some synergy of ideas

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
that maybe you wouldn't have had before.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Let them do it. Give them some freedom,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
We spend so much of our lives at the workplace,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Is that all there was?"

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
(Laughter)

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
So in summary,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
we need a drastic change

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
in the way we think and behave,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
but we don't need

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
a workers' revolution.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
We don't need a workers' revolution.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
What we need

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
is a players' uprising.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
What we need is a players' uprising.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
What we need is a players' uprising.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
Seriously, we need to band together.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Today is the start of the uprising.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
But what you need to do

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
is fan the flames of the revolution.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
of what worked

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
about reinvigorating our lives, our schools,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
and our work with play;

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
about how play promotes

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
a sense of promise and self-fulfillment;

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.260
of how play promotes innovation and productivity,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.260
we can transform Bulgaria for the better.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Thank you.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
(Applause)
