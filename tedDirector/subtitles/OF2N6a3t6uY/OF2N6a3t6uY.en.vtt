00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.176
I am the daughter of a forger,

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:21.121
not just any forger ...

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.038
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:27.560
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.872
My father is no such man.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:31.060
For 30 years of his life,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.762
he made false papers --

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.707
never for himself, always for other people,

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:39.596
and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.

00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:41.760
Let me introduce him.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
Here is my father at age 19.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.760
It all began for him during World War II,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
when at age 17 he found himself thrust

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.460
into a forged documents workshop.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.960
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760
And it's not a banal story --

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
after the liberation he continued

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.860
to make false papers until the '70s.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.510
When I was a child

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.658
I knew nothing about this, of course.

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:11.160
This is me in the middle making faces.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.492
I grew up in the Paris suburbs

00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:17.381
and I was the youngest of three children.

00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:20.271
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.216
apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:26.105
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:29.060
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.660
and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.960
And, of course, he never talked about his past life

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.160
when he was a forger.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.719
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.636
that perhaps could have led me suspect something.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:45.553
I was in high school and got a bad grade,

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.498
a rare event for me,

00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:50.443
so I decided to hide it from my parents.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.332
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.460
I started working on my mother's signature,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.167
because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.084
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:06.001
and started practicing, practicing, practicing,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.946
until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:09.890
and went into action.

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.260
Later, while checking my school bag,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.752
my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:17.697
She yelled at me like she never had before.

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:20.614
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:23.559
and then I waited for my father to come back from work

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.449
with, one could say, much apprehension.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.421
I heard him come in.

00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.338
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.283
sat on the corner of the bed,

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:36.173
and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:39.090
and when he saw me he started laughing.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.007
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:46.360
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.260
Indeed, it's rather small.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I was born in Algeria.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.565
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"

00:02:57.565 --> 00:02:58.760
and that means "fighter."

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.344
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:06.261
and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:09.179
especially that he had "done" World War II,

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.123
that he had "done" the Algerian war.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:14.041
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:17.958
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.260
I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.460
One day, while my father was working on a file

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.626
for us to obtain French nationality,

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.571
I happened to see some documents

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.988
that caught my attention.

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:35.660
These are real!

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.378
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:40.160
But the document I happened to see

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.267
that would help us build a case for the authorities

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.960
was a document from the army

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.129
that thanked my father for his work

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.048
on behalf of the secret services.

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.965
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.660
My father, a secret agent?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.826
It was very James Bond.

00:03:56.826 --> 00:04:01.715
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.

00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:04.660
And later, I told myself that

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.260
one day I would have to question him.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.411
And then I became a mother and had a son,

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.560
and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560
I had become a mother

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.860
and suddenly I was very, very afraid.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.108
I feared he'd go

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:23.053
and take his silences with him,

00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:24.997
and take his secrets with him.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.360
I managed to convince him that it was important for us,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.887
but possibly also for other people

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.832
that he shared his story.

00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:32.776
He decided to tell it to me

00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:34.060
and I made a book,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.666
from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:39.583
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:41.528
His parents were of Russian descent.

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:45.445
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:50.260
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.460
And with his only diploma,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.760
his primary education certificate,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.260
he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.460
That's where he discovered something totally magical,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.260
and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.060
it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.860
During that time the war was happening

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.727
and his mother was killed when he was 15.

00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:13.260
This coincided with the time when

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
he threw himself body and soul into chemistry

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.960
because it was the only consolation for his sadness.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.423
All day he would ask many questions to his boss

00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:24.260
to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.760
and at night, when no one was looking,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.960
he'd put his experience to practice.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.060
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.260
All this to tell you

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.760
that if my father became a forger, actually,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760
it was almost by accident.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.260
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.460
and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.595
Well, they were out,

00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:52.512
but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.

00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:55.760
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.260
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that although he was being persecuted,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
he'd never thought of false papers.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.760
In those times documents had hard covers,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.260
they were filled in by hand,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and they stated your job.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.460
In order to survive, he needed

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460
to be working. He asked the man

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.260
to write "dyer."

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.460
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.760
Of course he knew.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.560
And suddenly the man started explaining that

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.260
actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.860
even the top experts

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.460
could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.660
the "Waterman" blue ink.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.560
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.760
how to bleach it.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.960
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.760
who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.760
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.410
we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.260
the so-called "correction pen."

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.760
(Applause)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.660
But it was only the beginning.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.260
That's my father.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.760
As soon as he got to the lab,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.160
even though he was the youngest,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.060
he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.960
All the movements stopped at falsifying.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.560
But demand was ever-growing

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.160
and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.660
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.460
He started a press. He started photoengraving.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.060
He started making rubber stamps.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.860
He started inventing all kind of things --

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.260
with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Anyway, he had to do all this

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.060
because he was completely obsessed with output.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.260
He had made a simple calculation:

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.360
In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.760
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.760
This sense of

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.960
responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.960
and also his guilt for being a survivor,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.560
since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.812
stayed with him all his life.

00:08:04.813 --> 00:08:07.730
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,

00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:10.360
he continued to make false papers

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.660
at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.560
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.460
because there were many.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.960
There were obviously financial sacrifices

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.760
because he always refused to be paid.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.460
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.060
If he had accepted payment,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.860
he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.260
depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.160
So he was a photographer by day,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.760
and a forger by night for 30 years.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.760
He was broke all of the time.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.760
Then there were the emotional sacrifices:

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.760
How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.960
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.260
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.660
involving his family that I understood much later.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.760
One day my father introduced me to my sister.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.760
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.760
and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.560
and they were 30 years older than me.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.060
They are both in their sixties now.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.760
In order to write the book,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.260
I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.760
who was the father she had known.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.860
She explained that the father that she'd had

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.060
would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.660
They would get all dressed up and wait for him,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.460
but he would almost never come.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.760
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
And then he would not come.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.060
Then one day he totally disappeared.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.460
Time passed,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.660
and they thought he had surely forgotten them,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.260
at first.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.760
Then as time passed,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760
at the end of almost two years, they thought,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.960
"Well, perhaps our father has died."

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.260
And then I understood

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.160
that asking my father so many questions

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.960
was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.560
because it was painful.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.260
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.960
orphaned,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.260
my father was making false papers.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.760
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.560
After the liberation he made false papers

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.460
to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.360
before the creation of Israel.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.760
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.260
he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.860
After the Algerian war,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.460
at the heart of the international resistance movements,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.160
his name circulated

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.460
and the whole world came knocking at his door.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.960
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.960
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.460
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.960
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.760
There was also Latin America.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.460
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.360
in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.460
and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:09.060
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.760
Then there was the Vietnam War.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.060
My father made false papers for the American deserters

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.260
who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Europe was not spared either.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.401
My father made false papers for the dissidents

00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:24.160
against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.152
against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,

00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.860
and even in France.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.014
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.

00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:36.660
My father watched, benevolently, of course,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.460
the demonstrations of the month of May,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.760
but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.260
because he had over 15 countries to serve.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.628
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:49.572
for someone you might recognize.

00:11:49.573 --> 00:11:52.489
(Laughter)

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.110
He was much younger in those days,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.260
and my father agreed to make false papers

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.296
to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:04.260
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.760
and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.260
But, he agreed to do it,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.660
even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.854
just because

00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.260
it was a good opportunity

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.744
to mock the authorities,

00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:21.760
and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.260
and that ideas have no borders.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
All my childhood,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.357
while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,

00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:36.247
my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes

00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:39.164
with unshakeable utopias

00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:42.081
who managed to make miracles.

00:12:42.082 --> 00:12:46.060
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.560
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.805
except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.

00:12:51.806 --> 00:12:53.060
I understood much later

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.667
that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.

00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:59.584
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,

00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:01.529
he ever had any regrets.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.260
He said no.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.419
He told me that he would have been unable

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.336
to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.

00:13:08.337 --> 00:13:11.360
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.560
that another world is possible --

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.560
a world where no one would ever need a forger.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.560
He's still dreaming about it.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.004
My father

00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:21.760
is here in the room today.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.839
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:46.259
(Applause)

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Thank you.
