00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:16.012
Everything is interconnected.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:19.538
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:21.561
We are a small fishing tribe

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.745
situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.910
near the town of Southampton in New York.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.380
When I was a little girl,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.728
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:39.282
There were no clouds in the sky.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:42.453
And after a while I began to perspire.

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:45.979
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.827
"Look, do you see that?

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:50.946
That's part of you up there.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.861
That's your water that helps to make the cloud

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.134
that becomes the rain that feeds the plants

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:01.920
that feeds the animals."

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.912
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature

00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:09.328
that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:12.029
I started storm chasing in 2008

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:15.897
after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:22.108
And so three days later, driving very fast,

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:29.368
I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:33.819
capable of producing grapefruit-size hail

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.812
and spectacular tornadoes,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:42.118
although only two percent actually do.

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:47.262
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:51.328
and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.702
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:58.826
making it very dark and ominous standing under them.

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:01.728
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:05.995
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:12.697
and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:16.094
And then there are the colors in the clouds

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:21.284
of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:24.562
I've learned to respect the lightning.

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.696
My hair used to be straight.

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.120
(Laughter)

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.744
I'm just kidding.

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:31.886
(Laughter)

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.062
What really excites me about these storms

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:39.279
is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.297
with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:46.029
They become lovely monsters.

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.562
When I'm photographing them,

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:52.295
I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.287
As I stand under them,

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.494
I see not just a cloud,

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.377
but understand that what I have the privilege to witness

00:02:59.377 --> 00:03:03.827
is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version

00:03:03.827 --> 00:03:10.145
that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:14.703
and even this very planet.

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:17.160
All my relations. Thank you.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.537
(Applause)
