00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and I started in the context

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
of developing countries,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
So if you think of a map of your country,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I think you'll realize

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
that for every country on Earth,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
you could draw little circles to say,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
"These are places where good teachers won't go."

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
On top of that,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
those are the places from where trouble comes.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So we have an ironic problem --

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
good teachers don't want to go

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
to just those places where they're needed the most.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I started in 1999

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to try and address this problem with an experiment,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I basically embedded a computer

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
they'd never seen a computer before,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and they didn't know what the internet was.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
turned it on and left it there.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
After this,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
But I repeated this all over India

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and then through

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
a large part of the world

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and noticed

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that children will learn to do

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
what they want to learn to do.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
This is the first experiment that we did --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
eight year-old boy on your right

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
teaching his student, a six year-old girl,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and he was teaching her how to browse.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
This boy here in the middle of central India --

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
this is in a Rajasthan village,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
where the children recorded their own music

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and then played it back to each other

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and in the process,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
They did all of this in four hours

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
after seeing the computer for the first time.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
In another South Indian village,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
these boys here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
had assembled a video camera

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
They downloaded it from Disney.com,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
or one of these websites,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
14 days after putting the computer in their village.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So at the end of it,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
we concluded that groups of children

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
irrespective of who

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
or where they were.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
At that point, I became a little more ambitious

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and decided to see

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
what else could children do with a computer.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
where I gave a group of children --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I gave them a computer

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
with a speech-to-text interface,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
which you now get free with Windows,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and asked them to speak into it.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So when they spoke into it,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
the computer typed out gibberish,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Make yourself understood

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
to the computer."

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So the children said, "How do we do that."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And I said,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
"I don't know, actually."

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
(Laughter)

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And I left.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
(Laughter)

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Two months later --

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and this is now documented

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
in the Information Technology

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
for International Development journal --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that accents had changed

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
(Laughter)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So they could do that on their own.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
After that, I started to experiment

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
with various other things

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that they might learn to do on their own.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
from the late Arthur C. Clarke,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
who said, "I want to see what's going on."

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
He said two interesting things,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
(Laughter)

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
The second thing he said was that,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
"If children have interest,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
then education happens."

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And I was doing that in the field,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
so every time I would watch it and think of him.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
help people,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
because children quickly learn to navigate

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the web and find things which interest them.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And when you've got interest, then you have education.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
This is a 15 year-old boy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
like animals,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and I listen to music.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
This is in Cambodia,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
rural Cambodia --

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
a fairly silly arithmetic game,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
They would, you know, throw it back at you.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
They'd say, "This is very boring."

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
If you leave it on the pavement

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and if all the adults go away,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
then they will show off with each other

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
about what they can do.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
This is what these children are doing.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
They are trying to multiply, I think.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And all over India,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
at the end of about two years,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
children were beginning to Google their homework.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
As a result, the teachers reported

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
tremendous improvements in their English --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
(Laughter)

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
rapid improvement and all sorts of things.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
(Laughter)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And indeed they had.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I mean, if there's stuff on Google,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
why would you need to stuff it into your head?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
So at the end of the next four years,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
to achieve educational objectives on their own.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
At that time, a large amount of money

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
had come into Newcastle University

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
to improve schooling in India.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
a million pounds-worth of University money

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
sitting in Delhi."

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So in 2006,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
I bought myself a heavy overcoat

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and moved to Newcastle.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
I wanted to test the limits

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
of the system.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
was actually done in India.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And I set myself and impossible target:

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
can Tamil speaking

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
12-year-old children

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
in a South Indian village

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
teach themselves biotechnology

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
in English on their own?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
they get another zero,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I called in 26 children.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
They all came in there, and I told them

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
It's all in English, and I'm going.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
(Laughter)

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So I left them with it.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
I came back after two months,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
They said, "Yes, we did."

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
So I said,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
"Well, how long did you practice on it

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
before you decided you understood nothing?"

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
They said, "We look at it every day."

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
literally,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
causes genetic disease,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
we've understood nothing else."

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
(Laughter)

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:16.260
(Applause)

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
(Laughter)

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It took me three years to publish that.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
One of the referees who refereed the paper said,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
"It's too good to be true,"

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
which was not very nice.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Well, one of the girls had taught herself

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
to become the teacher.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And then that's her over there.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Remember, they don't study English.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and then she looked and did this.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
But 30 percent is not a pass.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So I found that they had a friend,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
a local accountant, a young girl,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and they played football with her.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
enough biotechnology to pass?"

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
She said, "What's that?"

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
I said, "Well, what you've got to do

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
is stand behind them

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and admire them all the time.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
She did that for two months.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
The scores went up to 50,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
So I came back to Newcastle

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
with these results

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and decided

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
that there was something happening here

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that definitely was getting very serious.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I came to the most remote place that I could think of.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
(Laughter)

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
is the little town of Gateshead.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
In Gateshead, I took 32 children

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and I started to fine-tune the method.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
I made them into groups of four.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
I said, "You make your own groups of four.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
"You can exchange groups.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
You can walk across to another group,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
if you don't like your group, etc.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And I explained to them

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.260
(Applause)

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
The children enthusiastically got after me and said,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
"Now, what do you want us to do?"

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I gave them six GCSE questions.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
The first group -- the best one --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
solved everything in 20 minutes.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
The worst, in 45.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
They used everything that they knew --

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
news groups, Google, Wikipedia,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Ask Jeeves, etc.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I said, "Well, let's try it.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
I'll come back after two months.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
We'll give them a paper test --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
no computers, no talking to each other, etc."

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
was 76 percent.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
When I did the experiment, when I did the test,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
after two months, the score

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
was 76 percent.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
There was photographic recall

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
inside the children,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
I suspect because they're discussing with each other.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
A single child in front of a single computer

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
will not do that.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
I have further results,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
which are almost unbelievable,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
of scores which go up with time.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Because their teachers say

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
that after the session is over,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
the children continue to Google further.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Here in Britain, I put out a call

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
for British grandmothers,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
after my Kuppam experiment.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Well, you know,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
200 of them volunteered immediately.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
(Laughter)

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
The deal was that they would give me

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
one hour of broadband time,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
sitting in their homes,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
one day in a week.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
So they did that,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and over the last two years,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
over 600 hours of instruction

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
has happened over Skype,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
using what my students call the granny cloud.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
The granny cloud sits over there.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
You say it.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
You can't catch me.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Children: You can't catch me.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Children: I'm the gingerbread man.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Teacher: Well done. Very good ...

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
SM: Back at Gateshead,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
in 15 minutes.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Two children watch a TEDTalk.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
They wanted to be footballers before.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
After watching eight TEDTalks,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
(Laughter)

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
(Applause)

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
It's pretty simple stuff.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
This is what I'm building now --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
The furniture is designed

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
big broadband connections, but in groups.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
The mediator is from Pune, India.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
I went to Turin in May.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
I speak only English, they speak only Italian,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
so we had no way to communicate.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
The children looked at it and said, "What?"

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
I said, "Well, do it."

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
went back into Italian Google.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Fifteen minutes later --

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
next question: where is Calcutta?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
This one, they took only 10 minutes.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
I tried a really hard one then.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
There was silence for a while,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
It's Pitagora."

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And then,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
in 20 minutes,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
This sent shivers up my spine.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
These are 10 year-olds.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
(Laughter)

00:15:52.260 --> 00:16:01.260
(Applause)

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
SM: So you know what's happened?

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
I think we've just stumbled across

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
a self-organizing system.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
A self-organizing system is one

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
where a structure appears

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
without explicit intervention from the outside.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
which is that the system starts to do things,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
which it was never designed for.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
Which is why you react the way you do,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
because it looks impossible.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
I think I can make a guess now --

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
education is self-organizing system,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
where learning is an emergent phenomenon.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
but I'm going to try.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
there are many more than that on the planet --

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
10 million SOLEs,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
180 billion dollars and 10 years.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
We could change everything.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Thanks.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:06.260
(Applause)
