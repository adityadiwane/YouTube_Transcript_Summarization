00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.256
I've always wanted to be a cyborg.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.456
One of my favorite shows as a kid
was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.656
and this is a little bit closer
to the 240-dollar man or so, but --

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.976
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.416
At any rate, I would normally
feel very self-conscious and geeky

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.656
wearing this around,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.016
but a few days ago
I saw one world-renowned statistician

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.616
swallowing swords on stage here,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.600
so I figure it's OK amongst this group.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.496
But that's not what I want
to talk about today.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.416
I want to talk about toys,
and the power that I see inherent in them.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.616
When I was a kid,
I attended Montessori school

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.016
up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.176
And at the time
I didn't think much about it,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.616
but then later, I realized that that was
the high point of my education.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.896
From that point on, everything else
was pretty much downhill.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.856
And it wasn't until later,
as I started making games, that --

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.016
I really actually
think of them more as toys.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.576
People call me a game designer,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.856
but I really think
of these things more as toys.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.236
I started getting very interested
in Maria Montessori and her methods,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.916
and the way she went about things,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.276
and the way she thought it
very valuable for kids

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.836
to discover things on their own

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.036
rather than being taught
these things overtly.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.296
And she would design these toys,
where kids in playing with the toys

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.496
would come to understand
these deep principles

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.096
of life and nature through play.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.136
And since they discovered this,
it stuck with them so much more,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.536
and also they would experience
their own failures.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.056
There was a failure-based aspect
to learning there. It was very important.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.456
And so, the games that I do,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.816
I think of really more
as modern Montessori toys.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.436
And I really kind of want them
to be presented in a way

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.656
to where kids can kind of explore
and discover their own principles.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.845
So a few years ago,

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.436
I started getting very interested
in the SETI program.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.757
And that's the way I work.

00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.858
I get interested in different subjects,
I dive in, research them,

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:04.639
and then try to figure out
how to craft a toy around that,

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:07.640
so that other people can experience
the same sense of discovery

00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:09.703
that I did as I was learning that subject.

00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:11.184
And it led me to astrobiology,

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:13.265
the study of possible life
in the universe.

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.586
And then Drake's equation,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.187
looking at the probability
of life arising on planets,

00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.828
how long it might last,
how many planets are out there.

00:02:19.852 --> 00:02:22.789
And I started looking
at how interesting Drake's equation was,

00:02:22.813 --> 00:02:25.190
because it spanned
all these different subjects --

00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:29.136
physics, chemistry,
sociology, economics, astronomy.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.896
And another thing that really
impressed me a long time ago

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.895
was "Powers of Ten,"
Charles and Ray Eames' film.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.496
And I started putting those two together
and wondering, could I build a toy

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.856
where kids would trip across
all these interesting principles of life,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.056
as it exists and as it might
go in the future.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.056
Things where you might trip across things

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.416
like the Copernican principle,
the Fermi paradox,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.976
the anthropic principle,
the origin of life.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.176
And so I'm going to show you a toy today
that I've been working on,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.136
that I think of more
as kind of a philosophy toy.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.536
Playing this toy will bring up
philosophical questions in you.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.616
The game is "Spore."
I've been working on it for several years.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.656
It's getting pretty close to finished now.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.057
It occurs at all these different scales,
from very small to very large.

00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:11.218
I'm going to pop in
at the start of the game.

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:13.699
And you actually start this game
in a drop of water,

00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:15.740
as a very, very small
single-cell creature,

00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:19.797
and right off the bat you basically
just have to live, survive, reproduce.

00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:22.776
So here we are,
at a very microscopic scale,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.256
swimming around.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.656
And I actually realize
that cells don't have eyes,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.976
but it helps to make it cute.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.856
The players are going to play
through every generation of this species,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.136
and as you play the game,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.256
the creature is actually
growing bit by bit.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.856
And as we start growing,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.936
the camera will
actually start zooming out,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.176
and things that you see
in the background there

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.376
will start slowly
pulling into the foreground,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.816
showing you a little bit of what
you'll be interacting with as you grow.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.976
So as we eat, the camera
starts pulling out,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.976
and then we start interacting
with larger and larger organisms.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.216
We actually play
through many generations here,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.456
at the cellular scale.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.896
I'm going to skip ahead here.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.296
At some point we get larger,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.285
and we actually get
to a macroevolution scale.

00:04:03.102 --> 00:04:05.976
Now, at this point
we're leaving the water,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.736
and one thing that's kind of important
about this game is that, at every level,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.016
the player is designing their creature,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.976
and that's a fundamental aspect of this.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.976
Now, in the evolution game here,
the creature scale,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.576
basically you have to eat,
survive, and then reproduce.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.416
You know, very Darwinian.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.416
One thing we noticed with "The Sims,"
a game I did earlier,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.096
is that players love making stuff.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.296
When they were able
to make stuff in the game,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.537
they had a lot of empathy
in connection to it.

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:32.237
Even if it wasn't as pretty

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.952
as a professional artist
would make for games,

00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:36.193
it really stuck with them

00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:38.674
and they really cared
about what would happen to it.

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:42.128
At this point, we've left the water,
and now with this little creature --

00:04:42.152 --> 00:04:44.222
we could bring up
the volume a little bit --

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.182
and now we might try to eat.

00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:49.299
We might sneak up
on this little guy over here maybe,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.280
and try and eat him.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.376
OK, well, we fight.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.800
(Creatures grunting)

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.960
OK, we got him.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.480
Now we get a meal.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:05.096
So really, at this part of the game,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.736
what we're doing is we're
running around and surviving,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.696
and also getting to the next generation,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.016
because we're going to play
through every generation of this creature.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.616
We can mate, so I'm going to see

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.200
if one of these creatures
wants to mate with me. Yeah.

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:23.656
(Creatures grunting)

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.496
We didn't want to replay
actual evolution with humans and all that,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.256
because it's almost more interesting

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.536
to look at alternate
possibilities in evolution.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.816
Evolution is usually presented
as this one path that we took through,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.496
but really it represents
this huge set of possibilities.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.416
Now, once we mate, we click on the egg.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.976
And this is where the game
starts getting interesting,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.416
because one of the things
we really focused on here

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.696
was giving the players
very high-leverage tools,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.296
so that for very little effort,
the player can make something very cool.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.976
And it involves a lot
of intelligence on the tool side.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.576
But basically, this is the editor

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.878
where we're going to design
the next generation.

00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:59.936
So it has a little spine.
I can move around, I can extend.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.496
I can also inflate or deflate it
with the mouse wheel,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.856
so you sculpt it like clay.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.216
We have parts here
that I can put on or pull off.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.496
The idea is that the player
can basically design

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.536
anything they can think of in this editor,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.376
and we'll basically bring it to life.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.656
So I might put some limbs
on the character here.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.256
I'll inflate them kind of large.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.240
And in this case
I might decide I'm going to put --

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.640
I'll put mouths on the limbs.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.096
So pretty much players are encouraged
to be very creative in the game.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.416
Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle,
maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.120
And I'll also give it a few legs.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.336
So in some sense

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.776
we want this to feel like an amplifier
for the player's imagination,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.536
so that with a very small number of clicks
a player can create something

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.936
that they didn't really think
was possible before.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.416
This is almost like designing
something like Maya --

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.936
that an eight-year-old can use.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.376
But really the goal here was,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.896
within about a minute,
I wanted somebody to replicate

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.176
what typically takes a pictorial artist
several weeks to create.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.136
OK, now I'll put some hands on it.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.056
OK, so here I've basically
thrown together a little creature.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.160
Let me give it a little weapon
on the tail here, so it can fight.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.496
OK, so that's the complete model.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.656
Now we can actually
go to the painting phase.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.176
At this phase, the program
has some understanding

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.816
of the topology of this creature.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.876
It knows where the backbone is,
where the spine, the limbs are,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.156
how stripes should run,
how it should be shaded.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.676
And so we're procedurally
generating the texture map,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.576
something a texture artist
would take many days to work on.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.536
And then we can test it out,
and see how it would move around.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.056
And so at this point the computer
is procedurally animating this creature.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.576
It's looking at whatever I've designed.
It will actually bring it to life.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.176
And I can see how it might dance.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.416
(Laughter)

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.800
How it might show emotions,
how it might fight.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.616
So it's acting with its two mouths there.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.496
I can even have it pose for a photo.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.976
Snap a little photo of it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.976
(Laughter)

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.016
So then I bring this back into the game.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.576
It's born, and I play the next generation
of my creature through evolution.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.056
Now again, the empathy
that the players have

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.096
when they create
the content is tremendous.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.896
When players create content in this game,
it's automatically sent up to a server

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.856
and then redistributed
to all the other players transparently.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.016
So in fact, as I'm interacting
in this world with other creatures,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.936
these creatures are transparently
coming from other players as they play.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.616
So the process of playing the game

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.496
is a process of building up
this huge database of content.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.376
And pretty much everything
you're going to see in this game,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.056
there's an editor for
that the player can create,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.679
up through civilization.

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:31.396
This is my baby. When I eat,
I'll actually start growing.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.456
This is the next generation.
But I'm going to skip ahead here.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.816
Normally what would happen is
these creatures would work their way up,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.296
eventually become intelligent.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.816
I'd start dealing with tribes, cities
and civilizations of them over time.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.056
I'm going to skip way ahead
to the space phase.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.016
Eventually they would go out into space,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.656
and start colonizing
and exploring the universe.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.358
Now, really, in some sense,

00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:55.656
I want the players to be building
this world in their imagination,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.696
and then extracting it from them
with the least amount of pain.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.856
So that's kind of
what these tools are about.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.135
How do we make the gameplay,

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.336
you know, basically
the player's imagination amplifier?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.066
And how do we make
these tools, these editors,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.096
something that are just as fun
as the game itself?

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.376
So this is the planet
that we've been playing on

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.056
up to this point in the game.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.856
So far the entire game has been played
on the surface of this little world here.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.056
At this point we're actually
dealing with a very little toy planet.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.176
Almost, again,
like the Montessori toy idea.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.416
What happens if you give
somebody a toy planet,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.656
and let them play
with a lot of dynamics on it?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.336
What could they discover?
What might they learn on this?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.376
This world was actually extracted
from the player's imagination.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.776
So, this is the planet
that the player evolved on.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.216
Things like the buildings, the vehicles,
the architecture, civilizations

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.576
were all designed by the player
up to this point.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.776
So here's a little city with some
of our guys walking around in it.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.656
And most games put the player
in the role of Luke Skywalker,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.776
this protagonist
playing through this story.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.936
This is more about putting the player
in the role of George Lucas.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.056
I want them, after they've
played this game,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.296
to have extracted an entire world
that they're now interacting with.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.536
As we pull down here,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.096
we still have a whole set of creatures
living on the surface of the planet.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.136
All these different
dynamics going on here.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.096
I can look over here, and this is
a little simplified food web

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.816
that's going on with the creatures.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.696
I can open this up and then scan
what exists on the surface.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.076
You get some sense of the diversity
of creatures that were brought in.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.076
Some of these were created by the player,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.696
others by other players,
automatically sent over here.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.436
But there's a very simple
calculation of what's required,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.116
how many plants are required
for the herbivores to live,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.596
how many herbivores
for the carnivores to eat, etc.,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.276
that you have to balance actively.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.516
Also with this phase,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.316
we're getting more and more
God-like powers for the player,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.656
and you can experiment
with this planet as a toy.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.456
So I can come in and I can do things,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.576
and just treat this planet
as a lump of clay.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.057
We have very simple
weather systems, simple geology.

00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.558
For instance, I could open one of my tools
here and then carve out rivers.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.136
So this whole thing is kind of
like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.896
I can also play with the dynamics
in this world over time.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.336
So one of the things I can do

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.736
is start pumping more CO2 gases
into the atmosphere,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.416
and so that's what I'm doing here.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.536
There's actually
a little readout down there

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.360
of our planetary atmosphere,
pressure and temperature.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.856
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.576
we're going to start pushing up
the greenhouse gases here

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.016
and if you'll start noticing,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.446
we start seeing
the ocean levels rise over time.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.936
And our cities
are going to be at risk too,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.976
because a lot of these are coastal cities.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.016
You can see the ocean levels
are rising now

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.316
and as they encroach upon the cities,
I'll start losing cities here.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.596
So basically, I want the players
to be able to experiment and explore

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.156
a huge amount of failure space.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.620
So there goes one city.

00:11:33.467 --> 00:11:35.896
Now, over time, this is
going to heat up the planet.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.616
So at first what we're going to see

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.176
is a global ocean rise
here on this little toy planet,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.217
but then over time --
I can speed it up --

00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:44.338
we'll see the heat impact of that as well.

00:11:44.362 --> 00:11:46.265
Not only will it get hotter,

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.606
but at some point it's going to get so hot
the oceans will evaporate.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.947
They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate,
and that'll be my planet.

00:11:52.971 --> 00:11:54.748
So basically, what we're getting here

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:57.749
is the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"
in about two minutes,

00:11:57.773 --> 00:12:00.910
and that actually brings up
an interesting point about games.

00:12:00.934 --> 00:12:04.094
Now here, our entire oceans
are evaporating off the surface,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.656
and as it keeps getting hotter,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.216
at some point the entire planet
is going to melt down. Here it goes.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.656
So we're not only
simulating biological dynamics --

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.896
food webs and all that --

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.616
but also geologic, you know,
on a very simple core scale.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.545
And what's interesting to me about games

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:21.176
is that I think we can take
a lot of long-term dynamics

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.216
and compress them
into very short-term experiences.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.136
Because it's so hard for people
to think 50 or 100 years out,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.776
but when you can give them a toy,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.136
and they can experience these
long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.496
I think it's an entirely
different point of view,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.296
where we're actually using the game
to remap our intuition.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.656
It's almost in the same way

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.416
that a telescope or microscope
recalibrates your eyesight;

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.176
I think computer simulations
can recalibrate your instinct

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
across vast scales of both space and time.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.856
So here's our little solar system,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.976
as we pull away
from our melted planet here.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.056
We actually have a couple
of other planets in this solar system.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.296
Let's fly to another one.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.776
We're going to have this unlimited
number of worlds you can explore here.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.136
As we move into the future,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.536
and we start going out
into space and doing stuff,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.056
we're drawing a lot
from things like science fiction.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.096
And all my favorite science fiction movies

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.296
I want to play out here
as different dynamics.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.296
This planet actually has some life on it.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.336
Here it is, some indigenous
life down here.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.696
One of the tools
I can eventually earn for my UFO

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.416
is a monolith that I can drop down.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.080
(Laughter)

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.976
Now, as you can see,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.296
these guys are actually
starting to go up and bow to it,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.336
and over time, once they touch it,
they will become intelligent.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.456
So I can actually
pick a species on a planet

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.856
and then make them sentient.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.016
Now they've actually
gone to tribal dynamics.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.056
And now, because
I'm actually the one here,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.896
I can get out of the UFO and walk up,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.016
and they should be worshipping me
at this point as a god.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.000
At first they're a little freaked out.

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.536
OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.576
(Laughter)

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.720
I think I'll leave
before they get hostile.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.936
But we basically want
a diversity of activities

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.616
the players can play through this.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.896
I want to be able to play

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.616
"The Day the Earth Stood Still,"
"2001: A Space Odyssey,"

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.256
"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.256
Now, as we pull away from this world --

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.696
we're going to keep
pulling away from the star now.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.536
One of the things that always
frustrated me about astronomy

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.776
when I was a kid

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.936
is how it was always presented
so two-dimensionally and so static.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.656
As we pull away from the star here,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.176
we're actually going now
out into interstellar space,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.056
and we're getting a sense
of the space around our home star.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.776
What I really wanted to do
is to present this, basically,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.096
as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.096
And also show the dynamics,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.816
and a lot of the interesting objects
that you might find, like, in the Hubble,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.096
at pretty much realistic
frequencies and scales.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.256
So most people
have no idea of the difference

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.656
between an emission nebula
and a planetary nebula.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.936
But these are the things

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.016
that we can put
in this little galaxy here.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.776
So we're flying over here
to what looks like a black hole.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.496
I want to basically have
the entire zoo of Hubble objects

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.376
that people can interact with
and play with, again, as toys.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.816
So here's a little black hole

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.160
that we probably
don't want to get too close to.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.136
But we also have stars and things as well.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.616
If we pull all the way back,
we start seeing the entire galaxy here,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.576
kind of slowly in motion.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.816
Typically, when people present galaxies,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.523
it's always beautiful photos,
but they're always static.

00:15:08.547 --> 00:15:11.436
And when you bring it forward in time
and start animating it,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.254
it's amazing what a galaxy
would look like fast forwarded.

00:15:14.278 --> 00:15:16.435
This would be about
a million years a second,

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:19.056
because you have about
one supernova every century.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.416
And so you'd have
this wonderful sparkling thing,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.896
with the disk slowly rotating,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.016
and this is roughly
what it would look like.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.036
Part of this is about bringing
the beauty of the natural world

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.916
to somebody in a very imaginative way,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.276
so that they can start
calibrating their instinct

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.356
across these vast scales
of space and time.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.616
Chris was wondering what kind of gods
the players would become.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.096
Because if you think about it,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.716
you're going to have 15-year-olds,
20-year-olds flying around this universe.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.196
They might be a nurturing god.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.316
They might be bootstrapping
life on planets,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.436
trying to terraform
and spread civilization.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.696
You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.176
because you actually can do that,
you can attack other intelligent races.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.222
You might be a networking god,
building alliances,

00:15:58.246 --> 00:16:02.102
or just curious, going around and wanting
to explore as much as you possibly can.

00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:06.427
But basically, the reason
why I make toys like this

00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:08.713
is because I think
if there's one difference

00:16:08.737 --> 00:16:11.456
I could possibly make in the world,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.856
that I would choose to make,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.016
it's that I would like
to somehow give people

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.856
just a little bit better calibration
on long-term thinking.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.216
Because I think most of the problems
that our world is facing right now

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.056
are the result of short-term thinking,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.256
and the fact that it is so hard for us
to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.936
And I think by giving kids toys like this
and letting them replay dynamics,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.056
very long-term dynamics
over the short term,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.296
and getting some sense
of what we're doing now,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.256
what it's going to be like in 100 years,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.256
I think probably is the most effective
thing I can be doing to help the world.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.947
And so that's why I think
that toys can change the world.

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.171
Thank you.
