00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Right now is the most exciting time

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
to see new Indian art.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
like never before.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I wish everyone at TED to know.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
The first is Bharti Kher.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
The central motif of Bharti's practice

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
is the ready-made store-bought bindi

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
every day, in an act closely associated with

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
the institution of marriage.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
But originally the significance of the bindi

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
is to symbolize the third eye

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
between the spiritual world and the religious world.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
by exploding it into something spectacular.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
which she then completely covers in bindis,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
often with potent symbolism.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
She says she first got started with

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
10 packets of bindis,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Our next artist, Balasubramaniam,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
working wonders with fiberglass.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I won't spend too much time on him here today,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
except to say that he really succeeds

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
at making the invisible visible.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
is known for her digital collages,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
as her primary source material.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
These comics are a fundamental way

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that children, especially in the diaspora,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
learn their religious and mythological folk tales.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I, for one, was steeped in these.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
these iconic images

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
embedded in these deeply influential comics.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
sculpture, painting and installation.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
As you can see, he's heavily influenced

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
by graffiti and street art,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
He really captures that sense of density

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
made of bones from cast resin.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Here he envisions the carcass

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.260
of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
This next artist, N.S. Harsha,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
actually has a studio right here in Mysore.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
He creates these fine, delicate images

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
which he then repeats on a massive scale.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
here with 192 functioning sewing machines,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
builds on her love of comic books and street art

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to comment on the roles and expectations

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
of modern Indian women.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and leaves the actual text

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Kashmir-raised,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and London-trained.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
since Raqs Media Collective are really

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
three artists working together.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
of multimedia art in India today,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
working across photography, video and installation.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
looking at evidence and clues embedded

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
in five narratives on these five different screens,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
in which the city itself may have been the culprit.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This next artist is probably the alpha male

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
paintings of everyday objects,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
known to every Indian.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and on a grander and grander scale,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
by incorporating them into ever more colossal

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
sculptures and installations.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Ranjani Shettar,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
creates ethereal sculptures and installations

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that really marry the organic to the industrial,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and brings, like Subodh, the local global.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and steeped in vegetable dye.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And she arranges them so that the viewer

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
actually has to navigate through the space,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and interact with the objects.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
She also explores themes of consumerism,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and the environment, such as in this work,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and are woven,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to go out and see and learn more

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Thank you very much for looking and listening.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Applause)
