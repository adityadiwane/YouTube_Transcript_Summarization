00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.692
I cannot forget them.

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:20.469
Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:25.113
Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,

00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:30.407
Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:35.167
Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.125
and the list is longer.

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:41.599
For many, their existence,
their humanity,

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:45.244
has been reduced to statistics,

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.540
coldly recorded as "security incidents."

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.095
For me, they were colleagues

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.625
belonging to that community
of humanitarian aid workers

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.434
that tried to bring a bit of comfort

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.521
to the victims of the wars
in Chechnya in the '90s.

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:06.164
They were nurses, logisticians,
shelter experts,

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:08.997
paralegals, interpreters.

00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:13.153
And for this service, they were murdered,

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.615
their families torn apart,

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.817
and their story largely forgotten.

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:21.974
No one was ever sentenced
for these crimes.

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:25.041
I cannot forget them.

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.090
They live in me somehow,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.320
their memories giving me
meaning every day.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.751
But they are also haunting
the dark street of my mind.

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.712
As humanitarian aid workers,

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:40.064
they made the choice
to be at the side of the victim,

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:44.661
to provide some assistance,
some comfort, some protection,

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.587
but when they needed
protection themselves,

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.295
it wasn't there.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.858
When you see the headlines
of your newspaper these days

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:55.923
with the war in Iraq or in Syria --

00:01:55.923 --> 00:02:00.087
aid worker abducted, hostage executed --

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:02.100
but who were they?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.025
Why were they there?

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.033
What motivated them?

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.909
How did we become
so indifferent to these crimes?

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.038
This is why I am here today with you.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:15.435
We need to find better ways
to remember them.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:22.566
We also need to explain the key values
to which they dedicated their lives.

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:26.778
We also need to demand justice.

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:29.939
When in '96 I was sent

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.654
by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to the North Caucasus,

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.526
I knew some of the risks.

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:37.879
Five colleagues had been killed,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.946
three had been seriously injured,

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:42.291
seven had already been taken hostage.

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.078
So we were careful.

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:48.152
We were using armored 
vehicles, decoy cars,

00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:51.207
changing patterns of travel,
changing homes,

00:02:51.207 --> 00:02:53.998
all sorts of security measures.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:03:01.208
Yet on a cold winter night
of January '98, it was my turn.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:05.185
When I entered my flat
in Vladikavkaz with a guard,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.341
we were surrounded by armed men.

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:10.998
They took the guard,
they put him on the floor,

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:13.622
they beat him up in front of me,

00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:16.306
tied him, dragged him away.

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:22.321
I was handcuffed, blindfolded,
and forced to kneel,

00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:26.204
as the silencer of a gun
pressed against my neck.

00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:27.942
When it happens to you,

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:30.975
there is no time for thinking,
no time for praying.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.749
My brain went on automatic,

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.115
rewinding quickly
the life I'd just left behind.

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:41.645
It took me long minutes to figure out

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:45.058
that those masked men there
were not there to kill me,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.231
but that someone, somewhere,
had ordered my kidnapping.

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:54.622
Then a process of dehumanization
started that day.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:59.045
I was no more than just a commodity.

00:04:01.195 --> 00:04:03.011
I normally don't talk about this,

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:08.028
but I'd like to share a bit with you
some of those 317 days of captivity.

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:11.654
I was kept in an underground cellar,

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:13.718
total darkness,

00:04:13.718 --> 00:04:17.472
for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:20.758
and then the guards 
would come, normally two.

00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:23.432
They would bring a big piece of bread,

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:25.936
a bowl of soup, and a candle.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:31.280
That candle would burn for 15 minutes,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.088
15 minutes of precious light,

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:39.224
and then they would take it away,
and I returned to darkness.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:44.538
I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.

00:04:44.538 --> 00:04:47.780
I could do only four small steps.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.735
I always dreamt of the fifth one.

00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:56.976
And no TV, no radio,
no newspaper, no one to talk to.

00:04:56.976 --> 00:05:01.069
I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:07.356
just two metal buckets open,
one for water, for one waste.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:14.955
Can you imagine that mock execution
can be a pastime for guards

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:20.264
when they are sadistic
or when they are just bored or drunk?

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:25.073
We are breaking my nerves very slowly.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:29.583
Isolation and darkness
are particularly difficult to describe.

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.975
How do you describe nothing?

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:34.993
There are no words for the depths
of loneliness I reached

00:05:34.993 --> 00:05:40.118
in that very thin border
between sanity and madness.

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:47.408
In the darkness, sometimes
I played imaginary games of checkers.

00:05:47.408 --> 00:05:49.611
I would start with the black,

00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.270
play with the white,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.879
back to the black
trying to trick the other side.

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.860
I don't play checkers anymore.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.177
I was tormented by the thoughts of my
family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:07.987
I didn't know what had happened to him.

00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:10.472
I was trying not to think,

00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:11.932
I tried to fill up my time

00:06:11.932 --> 00:06:15.743
by doing all sorts of physical
exercise on the spot.

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:19.683
I tried to pray, I tried all sorts
of memorization games.

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:25.456
But darkness also creates images
and thoughts that are not normal.

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:31.717
One part of your brain wants you
to resist, to shout, to cry,

00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:35.154
and the other part of the brain
orders you to shut up

00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:37.963
and just go through it.

00:06:37.963 --> 00:06:41.653
It's a constant internal debate;
there is no one to arbitrate.

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:48.083
Once a guard came to me,
very aggressively, and he told me,

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:52.220
"Today you're going to kneel
and beg for your food."

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.842
I wasn't in a good mood,
so I insulted him.

00:06:55.842 --> 00:06:58.776
I insulted his mother,
I insulted his ancestors.

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:03.207
The consequence was moderate:
he threw the food into my waste.

00:07:03.207 --> 00:07:06.882
The day after he came back
with the same demand.

00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:09.321
He got the same answer,

00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:13.532
which had the same consequence.

00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:17.363
Four days later,
the body was full of pain.

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:21.705
I didn't know hunger hurt so much
when you have so little.

00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:25.119
So when the guards came down,

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:31.063
I knelt.

00:07:31.063 --> 00:07:34.081
I begged for my food.

00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:39.668
Submission was the only way for me
to make it to another candle.

00:07:41.302 --> 00:07:43.113
After my kidnapping,

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.270
I was transferred
from North Ossetia to Chechnya,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.590
three days of slow travel
in the trunks of different cars,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.889
and upon arrival, I was interrogated

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.554
for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.

00:07:56.554 --> 00:07:58.318
The routine was always the same:

00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:00.710
a bit more light, 45 minutes.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.985
He would come down to the cellar,

00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:05.249
he would ask the guards
to tie me on the chair,

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:08.349
and he would turn on the music loud.

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:11.530
And then he would yell questions.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.325
He would scream. He would beat me.

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:16.228
I'll spare you the details.

00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:18.681
There are many questions
I could not understand,

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:23.244
and there are some questions
I did not want to understand.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:28.433
The length of the interrogation
was the duration of the tape:

00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.800
15 songs, 45 minutes.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.985
I would always long for the last song.

00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:38.280
On one day, one night in that cellar,
I don't know what it was,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.297
I heard a child crying above my head,

00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:44.129
a boy, maybe two or three years old.

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:47.776
Footsteps, confusion, people running.

00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:51.900
So when Ruslan came the day after,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.369
before he put the first question to me,

00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:57.968
I asked him, "How is your son today?
Is he feeling better?"

00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:00.754
Ruslan was taken by surprise.

00:09:00.754 --> 00:09:03.583
He was furious that the guards
may have leaked some details

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:06.161
about his private life.

00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:10.874
I kept talking about NGOs
supplying medicines to local clinics

00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:13.785
that may help his son to get better.

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:17.909
And we talked about education,
we talked about families.

00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.767
He talked to me about his children.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.833
I talked to him about my daughters.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:25.223
And then he'd talk about guns,
about cars, about women,

00:09:25.223 --> 00:09:29.542
and I had to talk about guns,
about cars, about women.

00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:33.280
And we talked until
the last song on the tape.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.923
Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.

00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:42.220
He did not touch me anymore.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.936
He did not ask any other questions.

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:48.791
I was no longer just a commodity.

00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:53.760
Two days after, I was transferred
to another place.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.866
There, a guard came to me,
very close -- it was quite unusual --

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:02.025
and he said with
a very soft voice, he said,

00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.649
"I'd like to thank you

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:08.689
for the assistance your organization
provided my family

00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:12.738
when we were displaced
in nearby Dagestan."

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:17.891
What could I possibly reply?

00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:22.667
It was so painful.
It was like a blade in the belly.

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:26.011
It took me weeks of internal thinking
to try to reconcile

00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.285
the good reasons we had
to assist that family

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:32.257
and the soldier of fortune he became.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.370
He was young, he was shy.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.645
I never saw his face.

00:10:36.645 --> 00:10:39.315
He probably meant well.

00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:41.707
But in those 15 seconds,

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:45.422
he made me question everything we did,

00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:47.813
all the sacrifices.

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:51.366
He made me think also how they see us.

00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:54.036
Until then, I had assumed
that they know why we are there

00:10:54.036 --> 00:10:56.915
and what we are doing.

00:10:56.915 --> 00:10:59.768
One cannot assume this.

00:10:59.768 --> 00:11:04.020
Well, explaining why we do this
is not that easy,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.812
even to our closest relatives.

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:10.459
We are not perfect, we are not superior,

00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:12.935
we are not the world's fire brigade,

00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:15.049
we are not superheroes,

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.721
we don't stop wars,

00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:22.105
we know that humanitarian response is not
a substitute for political solution.

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:26.563
Yet we do this because one life matters.

00:11:26.563 --> 00:11:28.816
Sometimes that's the only
difference you make --

00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:32.136
one individual, one family,
a small group of individuals --

00:11:32.136 --> 00:11:34.110
and it matters.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.967
When you have a tsunami,
an earthquake or a typhoon,

00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:41.075
you see teams of rescuers
coming from all over the world,

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:44.117
searching for survivors for weeks.

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:46.671
Why? Nobody questions this.

00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:48.784
Every life matters,

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:53.010
or every life should matter.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.935
This is the same for us
when we help refugees,

00:11:55.935 --> 00:12:00.795
people displaced within their country
by conflict, or stateless persons,

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.390
I know many people,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.398
when they are confronted
by overwhelming suffering,

00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:10.169
they feel powerless and they stop there.

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:14.046
It's a pity, because there are
so many ways people can help.

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:16.027
We don't stop with that feeling.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.678
We try to do whatever we can
to provide some assistance,

00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:21.332
some protection, some comfort.

00:12:21.332 --> 00:12:23.093
We have to.

00:12:23.093 --> 00:12:24.843
We can't do otherwise.

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:30.197
It's what makes us feel,
I don't know, simply human.

00:12:30.197 --> 00:12:34.316
That's a picture of me
the day of my release.

00:12:34.316 --> 00:12:38.658
Months after my release,
I met the then-French prime minister.

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:40.700
The second thing he told me:

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.231
"You were totally irresponsible
to go to the North Caucasus.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:48.137
You don't know how many
problems you've created for us."

00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:51.852
It was a short meeting.

00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:53.571
(Laughter)

00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:59.235
I think helping people
in danger is responsible.

00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:03.763
In that war, that nobody
seriously wanted to stop,

00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:06.108
and we have many of these today,

00:13:06.108 --> 00:13:10.608
bringing some assistance to people in need
and a bit of protection

00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:12.517
was not just an act of humanity,

00:13:12.517 --> 00:13:15.419
it was making a real difference
for the people.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.670
Why could he not understand this?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.597
We have a responsibility to try.

00:13:20.597 --> 00:13:24.431
You've heard about that concept:
Responsibility to Protect.

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:28.512
Outcomes may depend
on various parameters.

00:13:28.512 --> 00:13:32.369
We may even fail,
but there is worse than failing --

00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:35.120
it's not even trying when we can.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:40.316
Well, if you are met this way,
if you sign up for this sort of job,

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:44.954
your life is going to be full
of joy and sadness,

00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.633
because there are a lot of people
we cannot help,

00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:51.557
a lot of people we cannot protect,
a lot of people we did not save.

00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:53.800
I call them my ghost,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.757
and by having witnessed
their suffering from close,

00:13:56.757 --> 00:14:00.904
you take a bit 
of that suffering on yourself.

00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:03.970
Many young humanitarian workers

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.988
go through their first experience
with a lot of bitterness.

00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:09.960
They are thrown into situations
where they are witness,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.072
but they are powerless
to bring any change.

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:15.579
They have to learn to accept it

00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:18.958
and gradually turn this
into positive energy.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.407
It's difficult.

00:14:20.407 --> 00:14:22.945
Many don't succeed,

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:26.953
but for those who do,
there is no other job like this.

00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:30.733
You can see the difference
you make every day.

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:34.805
Humanitarian aid workers
know the risk they are taking

00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:39.717
in conflict areas or 
in post-conflict environments,

00:14:39.717 --> 00:14:46.429
yet our life, our job, is becoming 
increasingly life-threatening,

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:49.611
and the sanctity of our life is fading.

00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:54.100
Do you know that since the millennium,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.419
the number of attacks on humanitarian 
aid workers has tripled?

00:14:59.409 --> 00:15:02.041
2013 broke new records:

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.383
155 colleagues killed,

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:09.517
171 seriously wounded,

00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:12.975
134 abducted.

00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:17.178
So many broken lives.

00:15:17.178 --> 00:15:22.380
Until the beginning of the civil war
in Somalia in the late '80s,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.490
humanitarian aid workers
were sometimes victims

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.487
of what we call collateral damages,

00:15:28.487 --> 00:15:32.202
but by and large we were not
the target of these attacks.

00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:33.756
This has changed.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:35.032
Look at this picture.

00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:37.866
Baghdad, August 2003:

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:40.631
24 colleagues were killed.

00:15:40.631 --> 00:15:44.157
Gone are the days when
a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross

00:15:44.157 --> 00:15:47.933
would automatically protect us.

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:51.195
Criminal groups and some political groups

00:15:51.195 --> 00:15:54.051
have cross-fertilized
over the last 20 years,

00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:57.186
and they've created these sort of hybrids

00:15:57.186 --> 00:16:00.052
with whom we have no way of communicating.

00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:05.426
Humanitarian principles are tested,
questioned, and often ignored,

00:16:05.426 --> 00:16:10.312
but perhaps more importantly,
we have abandoned the search for justice.

00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:13.532
There seems to be
no consequence whatsoever

00:16:13.532 --> 00:16:16.997
for attacks against
humanitarian aid workers.

00:16:16.997 --> 00:16:21.357
After my release, I was told
not to seek any form of justice.

00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:24.584
It won't do you any good,
that's what I was told.

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:28.673
Plus, you're going to put in danger
the life of other colleagues.

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:32.884
It took me years to see the sentencing

00:16:32.884 --> 00:16:37.175
of three people associated 
with my kidnapping,

00:16:37.175 --> 00:16:39.711
but this was the exception.

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:44.230
There was no justice for any 
of the humanitarian aid workers

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.518
killed or abducted in Chechnya
between '95 and '99,

00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:51.146
and it's the same all over the world.

00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:54.583
This is unacceptable.

00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:56.394
This is inexcusable.

00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:01.107
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers
are war crimes in international law.

00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:04.195
Those crimes should not go unpunished.

00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:06.935
We must end this cycle of impunity.

00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:10.766
We must consider that those attacks
against humanitarian aid workers

00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:14.319
are attacks against humanity itself.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.944
That makes me furious.

00:17:18.274 --> 00:17:22.988
I know I'm very lucky
compared to the refugees I work for.

00:17:24.414 --> 00:17:28.041
I don't know what it is to have seen
my whole town destroyed.

00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:32.105
I don't know what it is to have seen
my relatives shot in front of me.

00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:36.354
I don't know what it is to lose
the protection of my country.

00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:40.649
I also know that I'm very lucky
compared to other hostages.

00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:46.331
Four days before my eventful release,
four hostages were beheaded

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:50.726
a few miles away from where
I was kept in captivity.

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.930
Why them?

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.591
Why am I here today?

00:17:56.641 --> 00:18:00.430
No easy answer.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.043
I was received with a lot of support
that I got from my relatives,

00:18:04.043 --> 00:18:07.862
from colleagues, from friends,
from people I didn't know.

00:18:07.862 --> 00:18:11.381
They have helped me over the years
to come out of the darkness.

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.559
Not everyone was treated
with the same attention.

00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:19.814
How many of my colleagues,
after a traumatic incident,

00:18:19.814 --> 00:18:23.090
took their own life?

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.819
I can count nine that I knew personally.

00:18:26.819 --> 00:18:30.547
How many of my colleagues
went through a difficult divorce

00:18:30.547 --> 00:18:33.481
after a traumatic experience

00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:38.209
because they could not explain
anything anymore to their spouse?

00:18:38.209 --> 00:18:40.663
I've lost that count.

00:18:40.663 --> 00:18:44.223
There is a price for this type of life.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:48.856
In Russia, all war monuments have
this beautiful inscription at the top.

00:18:48.856 --> 00:18:52.965
It says, (In Russian)

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.216
"No one is forgotten,
nothing is forgotten."

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:00.523
I do not forget my lost colleagues.

00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:02.859
I cannot forget anything.

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:06.072
I call on you to remember their dedication

00:19:06.072 --> 00:19:09.578
and demand that humanitarian
aid workers around the world

00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:12.155
be better protected.

00:19:12.155 --> 00:19:17.751
We should not let that light of hope
they have brought to be switched off.

00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:22.441
After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues
asked me, "But why do you continue?

00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:24.647
Why do you do this sort of job?

00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:27.201
Why do you have to go back to it?"

00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:29.696
My answer was very simple:

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:32.536
If I had quit,

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:36.553
that would have meant
my kidnapper had won.

00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:38.904
They would have taken my soul

00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:41.179
and my humanity.

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.826
Thank you.

00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:45.993
(Applause)
