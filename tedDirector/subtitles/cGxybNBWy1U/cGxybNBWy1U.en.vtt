[This talk contains graphic content.
Viewer discretion is advised.]

00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:19.042
This is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:23.081
This person had three different profiles

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:27.552
and 890 kids between 8 and 13 years old
among her friends list.

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:34.350
These are excerpts of a chat
with one of those kids.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:39.321
This is an exact copy of the chat.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.152
It's part of the case file.

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:48.162
This kid started sending private photos

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:50.459
until his family realized
what was going on.

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.121
The police report and subsequent
investigation lead them to a house.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.442
This was the girl's bedroom.

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:07.278
Nina Rodríguez was actually
a 24-year-old man

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:10.042
that used to do this with lots of kids.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:15.511
Micaela Ortega was 12 years old

00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:19.292
when she went to meet
her new Facebook friend,

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:20.696
also 12.

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:23.904
"Rochi de River," was her name.

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:29.472
She actually met Jonathan Luna,
who was 26 years old.

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:32.081
When they finally caught him,

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:36.419
he confessed that he killed the girl
because she refused to have sex with him.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.502
He had four Facebook profiles

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.896
and 1,700 women on his contact list;

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:49.316
90 percent of them
were under 13 years old.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.618
These are two different
cases of "grooming":

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.315
an adult contacts a kid
through the internet,

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:04.427
and through manipulation or lying,
leads that kid into sexual territory --

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.322
from talking about sex

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:08.530
to sharing private photos,

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.771
recording the kid using a webcam

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.573
or arranging an in-person meeting.

00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:15.687
This is grooming.

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.979
This is happening, and it's on the rise.

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:24.003
The question is: What are we going to do?

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.857
Because, in the meantime, kids are alone.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:30.560
They finish dinner, go to their rooms,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:31.874
close the door,

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:35.207
get on their computer, their cell phones,

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:37.441
and get into a bar,

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:39.684
into a club.

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.794
Think for one second
about what I've just said:

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.420
they're in a place full of strangers

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:51.493
in an uninhibited environment.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.763
The internet broke physical boundaries.

00:02:56.564 --> 00:03:00.595
When we're alone in our bedroom
and we go online,

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.196
we're not really alone.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.960
There are at least two reasons
why we're not taking care of this,

00:03:09.984 --> 00:03:11.686
or at least not in the right way.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.006
First, we're sure that everything
that happens online is "virtual."

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.053
In fact, we call it "the virtual world."

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.649
If you look it up in the dictionary,

00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:28.111
something virtual is something
that seems to exist

00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:29.414
but is not real.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:35.020
And we use that word
to talk about the internet:

00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:36.444
something not real.

00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:41.070
And that's the problem with grooming.

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:42.494
It is real.

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:49.348
Degenerate, perverted adults
use the internet to abuse boys and girls

00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:51.457
and take advantage of, among other things,

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.891
the fact that the kids and their parents
think that what happens online

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:56.477
doesn't actually happen.

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:03.160
Several years ago,
some colleagues and I founded an NGO

00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:05.128
called "Argentina Cibersegura,"

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:08.363
dedicated to raising awareness
about online safety.

00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:14.699
In 2013, we attended meetings
at the House of Legislature

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:17.123
to discuss a law about grooming.

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:21.783
I remember that a lot of people thought

00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:23.979
that grooming was strictly a precursor

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.708
to arranging an in-person meeting
with a kid to have sex with them.

00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:33.671
But they didn't think about what happened
to the kids who were exposed

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:36.753
by talking about sex
with an adult without knowing it,

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:41.470
or who shared intimate photos thinking
only another kid would see them,

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:42.644
or even worse,

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:46.000
who had exposed themselves
using their web cam.

00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:48.744
Nobody considered that rape.

00:04:51.047 --> 00:04:55.364
I'm sure lots of you find it odd to think
one person can abuse another

00:04:55.388 --> 00:04:56.733
without physical contact.

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.742
We're programmed to think that way.

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:03.070
I know, because I used to think that way.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.394
I was just an IT security guy

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:08.557
until this happened to me.

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:12.883
At the end of 2011,

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.538
in a little town in Buenos Aires Province,

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:19.074
I heard about a case for the first time.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.030
After giving a talk,

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:27.504
I met the parents of an 11-year-old girl
who had been a victim of grooming.

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:33.957
A man had manipulated her
into masturbating in front of her web cam,

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:35.421
and recorded it.

00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:38.986
And the video was on several websites.

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.482
That day, her parents asked us, in tears,

00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:45.048
to tell them the magic formula

00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.637
for how to delete those videos
from the internet.

00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:53.513
It broke my heart and changed me forever

00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:56.867
to be their last disappointment,
telling them it was too late:

00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:00.037
once content is online,

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:01.569
we've already lost control.

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:06.621
Since that day, I think about that girl

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.472
waking up in the morning,
having breakfast with her family,

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:13.913
who had seen the video,

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:20.460
and then walking to school, meeting
people that had seen her naked,

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.774
arriving to school, playing with
her friends, who had also seen her.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.017
That was her life.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.732
Exposed.

00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.801
Of course, nobody raped her body.

00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:39.427
But hadn't her sexuality been abused?

00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:46.366
We clearly use different standards
to measure physical and digital things.

00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:51.119
And we get angry at social networks

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:55.133
because being angry with ourselves
is more painful and more true.

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:58.633
And this brings us
to the second reason why

00:06:58.657 --> 00:07:01.190
we aren't paying proper
attention to this issue.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.489
We're convinced that kids
don't need our help,

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.771
that they "know everything"
about technology.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:13.202
When I was a kid,

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.566
at one point, my parents started
letting me walk to school alone.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:23.029
After years of taking me by the hand
and walking me to school,

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:25.882
one day they sat me down,

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.749
gave me the house keys

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:31.760
and said, "Be very careful with these;
don't give them to anyone,

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:35.939
take the route we showed you,
be at home at the time we said,

00:07:35.963 --> 00:07:38.702
cross at the corner,
and look both ways before you cross,

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:42.514
and no matter what,
don't talk to strangers."

00:07:44.787 --> 00:07:46.817
I knew everything about walking,

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.441
and yet, there was a responsible adult
there taking care of me.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.682
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:57.038
knowing how to take care
of yourself is another.

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.357
Imagine this situation:

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.945
I'm 10 or 11 years old,
I wake up in the morning,

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:05.085
my parents toss me the keys and say,

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.242
"Seba, now you can walk to school alone."

00:08:08.307 --> 00:08:10.507
And when I come back late,

00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:14.772
they say, "No, you need to be home
at the time we said."

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:18.510
And two weeks later,

00:08:18.534 --> 00:08:21.643
when it comes up,
they say, "You know what?

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.013
You have to cross at the corner,
and look both ways before crossing."

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:28.308
And two years later, they say,

00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:32.561
"And also, don't talk to strangers."

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:36.424
It sounds absurd, right?

00:08:38.132 --> 00:08:41.022
We have the same absurd behavior
in relation to technology.

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:44.092
We give kids total access

00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:46.956
and we see if one day, sooner or later,

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.147
they learn how to take care of themselves.

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.766
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.227
knowing how to take care
of yourself is another.

00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:59.100
Along those same lines,
when we talk to parents,

00:08:59.124 --> 00:09:04.619
they often say they don't care
about technology and social networks.

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:09.092
I always rejoin that by asking
if they care about their kids.

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:12.260
As adults, being interested
or not in technology

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:15.106
is the same as being interested
or not in our kids.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.065
The internet is part of their lives.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.586
Technology forces us to rethink
the relationship between adults and kids.

00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:28.004
Education was always based
on two main concepts:

00:09:28.028 --> 00:09:30.768
experience and knowledge.

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:38.245
How do we teach our kids to be safe online
when we don't have either?

00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:42.614
Nowadays, we adults
have to guide our children

00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:45.096
through what is often for us
unfamiliar territory --

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.139
territory much more inviting for them.

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.389
It's impossible to find an answer

00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:55.461
without doing new things --
things that make us uncomfortable,

00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:56.971
things we're not used to.

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:02.092
A lot of you may think it's easy for me,

00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:03.863
because I'm relatively young.

00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:05.981
And it used to be that way.

00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:08.322
Used to.

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:11.935
Until last year,

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:16.081
when I felt the weight
of my age on my shoulders

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:21.876
the first time I opened Snapchat.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.869
(Laughter)

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.995
(Applause)

00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:34.245
I didn't understand a thing!

00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:37.469
I found it unnecessary,

00:10:37.493 --> 00:10:40.635
useless, hard to understand;

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:42.547
it looked like a camera!

00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:44.247
It didn't have menu options!

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.268
It was the first time I felt the gap

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:51.884
that sometimes exists
between kids and adults.

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:56.822
But it was also an opportunity
to do the right thing,

00:10:56.846 --> 00:10:59.196
to leave my comfort zone, to force myself.

00:11:00.768 --> 00:11:04.079
I never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,

00:11:04.103 --> 00:11:08.705
but then I asked my teenage cousin
to show me how to use it.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.999
I also asked why she used it.

00:11:12.608 --> 00:11:14.040
What was fun about it?

00:11:15.558 --> 00:11:17.118
We had a really nice talk.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:20.202
She showed me her Snapchat,
she told me things,

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.637
we got closer, we laughed.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:26.149
Today, I use it.

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:27.995
(Laughter)

00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:30.233
I don't know if I do it right,

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:34.628
but the most important thing
is that I know it and I understand it.

00:11:36.226 --> 00:11:40.363
The key was to overcome the initial shock

00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:42.237
and do something new.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.240
Something new.

00:11:45.264 --> 00:11:48.184
Today, we have the chance
to create new conversations.

00:11:49.132 --> 00:11:51.448
What's the last app you downloaded?

00:11:51.472 --> 00:11:54.332
Which social network do you use
to contact your friends?

00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:57.084
What kind of information do you share?

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:00.456
Have you ever been
approached by strangers?

00:12:02.682 --> 00:12:05.818
Could we have these conversations
between kids and adults?

00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:10.039
We have to force ourselves
to do it. All of us.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:14.633
Today, lots of kids are listening to us.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.260
Sometimes when we go
to schools to give our talks,

00:12:19.284 --> 00:12:20.934
or through social networks,

00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.288
kids ask or tell us things

00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:27.609
they haven't told
their parents or their teachers.

00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:29.713
They tell us -- they don't even know us.

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.726
Those kids need to know

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.275
what the risks of being online are,

00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:41.500
how to take care of themselves,

00:12:41.524 --> 00:12:45.091
but also that, fundamentally,
as with almost everything else,

00:12:45.115 --> 00:12:48.120
kids can learn this from any adult.

00:12:51.378 --> 00:12:55.264
Online safety needs to be
a conversation topic

00:12:55.288 --> 00:12:57.889
in every house and every
classroom in the country.

00:12:59.683 --> 00:13:03.948
We did a survey this year that showed
that 15 percent of schools said

00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:06.263
they knew of cases of grooming
in their school.

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:08.617
And this number is growing.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.111
Technology changed
every aspect of our life,

00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:17.876
including the risks we face

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.302
and how we take care of ourselves.

00:13:20.326 --> 00:13:23.696
Grooming shows us this
in the most painful way:

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.357
by involving our kids.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.641
Are we going to do something
to avoid this?

00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:35.461
The solution starts
with something as easy as:

00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:37.504
talking about it.

00:13:37.528 --> 00:13:38.686
Thank you.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.449
