00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:15.654
What is love?

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:17.961
It's a hard term to define

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.850
in so far as it has a very wide application.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.619
I can love jogging.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.645
I can love a book, a movie.

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.516
I can love escalopes.

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.711
I can love my wife.

00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:34.115
(Laughter)

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:38.810
But there's a great difference

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.901
between an escalope and my wife, for instance.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.906
That is, if I value the escalope,

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:53.019
the escalope, on the other hand, 
it doesn't value me back.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.321
Whereas my wife, she calls me

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.122
the star of her life.

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:00.706
(Laughter)

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:02.662
Therefore, only another desiring conscience

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.894
can conceive me as a desirable being.

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:07.474
I know this, that's why

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:09.820
love can be defined in a more accurate way

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.130
as the desire of being desired.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.925
Hence the eternal problem of love:

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:22.869
how to become and remain desirable?

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.489
The individual used to find

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:28.722
an answer to this problem

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.727
by submitting his life to community rules.

00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:33.834
You had a specific part to play

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.049
according to your sex, your age,

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.925
your social status,

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.955
and you only had to play your part

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:44.032
to be valued and loved by the whole community.

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:47.789
Think about the young woman
who must remain chaste before marriage.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.155
Think about the youngest son 
who must obey the eldest son,

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:57.861
who in turn must obey the patriarch.

00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:02.147
But a phenomenon

00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:05.510
started in the 13th century,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.512
mainly in the Renaissance, in the West,

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.891
that caused the biggest identity crisis

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.088
in the history of humankind.

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:17.358
This phenomenon is modernity.

00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:20.306
We can basically summarize it
through a triple process.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:26.029
First, a process of rationalization
of scientific research,

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.714
which has accelerated technical progress.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:33.178
Next, a process of political democratization,

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:36.292
which has fostered individual rights.

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:40.850
And finally, a process of rationalization 
of economic production

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.735
and of trade liberalization.

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:46.617
These three intertwined processes

00:02:46.617 --> 00:02:49.026
have completely annihilated

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:53.332
all the traditional bearings of Western societies,

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:55.957
with radical consequences for the individual.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:58.518
Now individuals are free

00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:01.922
to value or disvalue

00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:06.127
any attitude, any choice, any object.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:12.344
But as a result, they are themselves confronted

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:14.409
with this same freedom that others have

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.861
to value or disvalue them.

00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:24.201
In other words, my value was once ensured

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:28.114
by submitting myself 
to the traditional authorities.

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:33.398
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.

00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:38.048
On the free market of individual desires,

00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:42.033
I negotiate my value every day.

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:44.619
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man.

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.705
He is obsessed: "Am I desirable? How desirable?

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:51.803
How many people are going to love me?"

00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:54.509
And how does he respond to this anxiety?

00:03:54.509 --> 00:04:03.025
Well, by hysterically collecting
symbols of desirability.

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:07.460
(Laughter)

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.765
I call this act of collecting,

00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:13.119
along with others, seduction capital.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.162
Indeed, our consumer society

00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:20.631
is largely based on seduction capital.

00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:24.742
It is said about this consumption
that our age is materialistic.

00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:28.690
But it's not true! We only accumulate objects

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.501
in order to communicate with other minds.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:36.918
We do it to make them love us, to seduce them.

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:40.638
Nothing could be less materialistic, 
or more sentimental,

00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:44.863
than a teenager buying brand new jeans

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:47.355
and tearing them at the knees,

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:49.467
because he wants to please Jennifer.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.917
(Laughter)

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.201
Consumerism is not materialism.

00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:57.276
It is rather what is swallowed up

00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:00.285
and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:04.731
or rather in the name of seduction capital.

00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:10.112
In light of this observation on contemporary love,

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:13.427
how can we think of love in the years to come?

00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:15.711
We can envision two hypotheses:

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:18.447
The first one consists of betting

00:05:18.447 --> 00:05:24.141
that this process of narcissistic 
capitalization will intensify.

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:28.209
It is hard to say what shape 
this intensification will take,

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:29.940
because it largely depends

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.708
on social and technical innovations,

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:37.755
which are by definition difficult to predict.

00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.657
But we can, for instance,

00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:43.381
imagine a dating website

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.513
which, a bit like those loyalty points programs,

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.705
uses seduction capital points

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:54.500
that vary according to my age, 
my height/weight ratio,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.023
my degree, my salary,

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.488
or the number of clicks on my profile.

00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:05.374
We can also imagine

00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:08.747
a chemical treatment for breakups

00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:12.565
that weakens the feelings of attachment.

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:16.622
By the way, there's a program on MTV already

00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:20.606
in which seduction teachers

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:24.524
treat heartache as a disease.

00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:28.226
These teachers call themselves "pick-up artists."

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:31.470
"Artist" in French is easy, it means "artiste."

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.182
"Pick-up" is to pick someone up,

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:36.298
but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:40.767
So they are artists of picking up chicks.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.224
(Laughter)

00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:47.339
And they call heartache "one-itis."

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.889
In English, "itis" is a suffix that signifies infection.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.353
One-itis can be translated as "an infection from one."

00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:59.122
It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:02.571
falling in love with someone

00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:04.403
is a waste of time,

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:06.310
it's squandering your seduction capital,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.102
so it must be eliminated

00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:11.831
like a disease, like an infection.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:15.532
We can also envision

00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:18.549
a romantic use of the genome.

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:22.199
Everyone would carry it around

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.399
and present it like a business card

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:30.393
to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.

00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:34.021
(Laughter)

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:39.184
Of course, this race for seduction,

00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:41.287
like every fierce competition,

00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:46.220
will create huge disparities 
in narcissistic satisfaction,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.270
and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.014
So we can expect that modernity itself,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:57.550
which is the origin of seduction capital,
would be called into question.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.181
I'm thinking particularly of the reaction

00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:05.110
of neo-fascist or religious communes.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.746
But such a future doesn't have to be.

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:16.168
Another path to thinking about love may be possible.

00:08:16.168 --> 00:08:18.258
But how?

00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:22.572
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?

00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:26.780
Well, by becoming aware
of my uselessness.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.879
(Laughter)

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.818
Yes,

00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:32.109
I'm useless.

00:08:32.109 --> 00:08:33.980
But rest assured:

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.442
so are you.

00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:37.592
(Laughter)

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:41.629
(Applause)

00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:45.999
We are all useless.

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:48.414
This uselessness is easily demonstrated,

00:08:48.414 --> 00:08:52.015
because in order to be valued

00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:55.026
I need another to desire me,

00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:57.316
which shows that I do not have any value of my own.

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:00.400
I don't have any inherent value.

00:09:02.764 --> 00:09:05.489
We all pretend to have an idol;

00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:08.408
we all pretend to be an idol for
someone else, but actually

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:11.830
we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.689
who appears totally cool and indifferent,

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:17.838
while he has actually anticipated and calculated

00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:21.443
so that all eyes are on him.

00:09:21.443 --> 00:09:23.012
I think that becoming aware

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:25.219
of this general imposture

00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:26.627
that concerns all of us

00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:28.447
would ease our love relationships.

00:09:28.447 --> 00:09:30.837
It is because I want to be loved

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:32.334
from head to toe,

00:09:32.334 --> 00:09:34.309
justified in my every choice,

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:37.081
that the seduction hysteria exists.

00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:39.374
And therefore I want to seem perfect

00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:40.994
so that another can love me.

00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:42.521
I want them to be perfect

00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:44.678
so that I can be reassured of my value.

00:09:44.678 --> 00:09:47.065
It leads to couples

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:49.357
obsessed with performance

00:09:49.357 --> 00:09:51.513
who will break up, just like that,

00:09:51.513 --> 00:09:54.067
at the slightest underachievement.

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:58.190
In contrast to this attitude,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.928
I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.

00:10:00.928 --> 00:10:02.296
What is tenderness?

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:06.169
To be tender is to accept 
the loved one's weaknesses.

00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:09.826
It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.021
(Laughter)

00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:13.091
That's pretty bad.

00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.423
On the contrary,

00:10:14.423 --> 00:10:17.189
there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:21.238
I refer specifically to a kind of humor
that is unfortunately underused.

00:10:21.238 --> 00:10:24.115
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.

00:10:24.115 --> 00:10:26.896
I refer to self-mockery.

00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:29.717
For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:31.794
by the constraints of tradition,

00:10:31.794 --> 00:10:33.342
I believe that self-mockery

00:10:33.342 --> 00:10:37.695
is one of the best means for 
the relationship to endure.
