00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
has been being able to create a photo-real,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
digital human face.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
we look at human faces every day.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
They are very important to how we communicate with each other.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
in order to believe whether these things are realistic.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
is take you through a process

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
using some computer graphics technology we've developed,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
that allow us to photograph her

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
And we basically capture enough information

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and different principle directions of light from the light stage,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
to figure out both the coarse-scale

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
and the fine-scale detail of her face.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
If we zoom in on this photograph right here,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.330
because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
to get a nice image of her facial texture.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
just like polarized sunglasses can block

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
the glare off of the road,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
polarizers can block the shine off of the skin,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
we can actually bring that specular reflection

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
of the skin back in,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
If you take the difference between these two images here,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
of just the shine off of Emily's skin.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
before we had done this.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And this is very important light to capture,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
It doesn't get underneath the translucent

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
layers of the skin and blur out.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
And, as a result, it's a very good cue

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
the things that actually make us look like real humans.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
we can go from a traditional face scan

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
and augment it with information

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And, even more importantly,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
we can shoot Emily

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
in just part of an afternoon,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
in many different facial poses and facial expressions.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
as it goes into different facial expressions.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
You can see things. Not only the face shape changes,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
from stretched skin pores

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
to the regular skin texture.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.330
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
the red and the green and the blue,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
diffuse the light differently,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And this is what we used

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
to give to the company Image Metrics

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
to create a rigged, digital version of Emily.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
But they basically created a digital puppet of her,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
where you can pull on these various strings,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
and it actually moves her face in ways that are

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
completely consistent with the scans that we took.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
they also used all of that detail

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
to create a set of what are called "displacement maps"

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
that animate as well.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
These are the displacement maps here.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
So the next process was then to animate her.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.330
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
they were able to drive the facial rig

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
with the computer-generated performance.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
So what you're going to see now, after this,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
is a completely photo-real digital face.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.330
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
We specialize in high-quality facial animation

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
for video games and films.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
We specialize in high quality facial animation

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
for video games and films.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
we saw in the first slide.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
Here is the specular component animating.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
You can see all the wrinkles happening there.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And that is Emily herself.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
Now, where are we going with this here?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.330
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
and we're looking at taking this technology

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
and applying it to whole human bodies.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
of Bruce, running in a new environment.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
And thank you very much.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.330
(Applause)
