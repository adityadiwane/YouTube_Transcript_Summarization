00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:18.376
When I was growing up, I really 
liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:22.492
One time, though, I thought climbing
a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:25.395
but I fell and broke my arm.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.478
I actually started first grade
with a big cast all over my torso.

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:34.323
It was taken off six weeks later,
but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:37.376
and I had to do physical therapy
to flex and extend it,

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.271
100 times per day, seven days per week.

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.063
I barely did it, because
I found it boring and painful,

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:47.694
and as a result, it took me
another six weeks to get better.

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:51.548
Many years later, my mom
developed frozen shoulder,

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:56.044
which leads to pain
and stiffness in the shoulder.

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:59.155
The person I believed for half of my life
to have superpowers

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.463
suddenly needed help
to get dressed or to cut food.

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:06.283
She went each week to physical therapy,
but just like me,

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.187
she barely followed the home treatment,

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:11.228
and it took her
over five months to feel better.

00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:14.503
Both my mom and I
required physical therapy,

00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:17.266
a process of doing a suite
of repetitive exercises

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.794
in order to regain the range of movement
lost due to an accident or injury.

00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:24.171
At first, a physical therapist
works with patients,

00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.134
but then it's up to the patients
to do their exercises at home.

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:30.923
But patients find physical therapy
boring, frustrating, confusing

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.844
and lengthy before seeing results.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:38.837
Sadly, patient noncompliance
can be as high as 70 percent.

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:42.226
This means the majority of patients
don't do their exercises

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:46.011
and therefore take
a lot longer to get better.

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:48.797
All physical therapists agree
that special exercises

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:50.957
reduce the time needed for recovery,

00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:53.333
but patients lack
the motivation to do them.

00:01:54.393 --> 00:01:58.898
So together with three friends,
all of us software geeks,

00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:00.987
we asked ourselves,

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:05.585
wouldn't it be interesting if patients
could play their way to recovery?

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.441
We started building MIRA,
A P.C. software platform

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:11.339
that uses this Kinect device,
a motion capture camera,

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.072
to transform traditional exercises
into video games.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:20.364
My physical therapist has already set up
a schedule for my particular therapy.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:22.616
Let's see how this looks.

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:28.746
The first game asks me
to fly a bee up and down

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:31.277
to gather pollen to deposit in beehives,

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.738
all while avoiding the other bugs.

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:36.964
I control the bee by doing
elbow extension and flexion,

00:02:36.964 --> 00:02:40.846
just like when I was seven years old
after the cast was taken off.

00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:44.929
When designing a game,
we speak to physical therapists at first

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.856
to understand what movement
patients need to do.

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:49.527
We then make that a video game

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:52.722
to give patients simple,
motivating objectives to follow.

00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:55.239
But the software is very customizable,

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.652
and physical therapists can also
create their own exercises.

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.183
Using the software, my physical therapist

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:03.471
recorded herself performing
a shoulder abduction,

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.664
which is one of the movements
my mom had to do

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:07.361
when she had frozen shoulder.

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.819
I can follow my therapist's example
on the left side of the screen,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.511
while on the right, I see myself
doing the recommended movement.

00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:16.554
I feel more engaged and confident,

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:19.015
as I'm exercising alongside my therapist

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:22.870
with the exercises my therapist
thinks are best for me.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.795
This basically extends the application
for physical therapists

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:30.323
to create whatever exercises
they think are best.

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:33.574
This is an auction house game
for preventing falls,

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:36.569
designed to strengthen muscles
and improve balance.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.564
As a patient, I need to do
sit and stand movements,

00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:41.422
and when I stand up,

00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:43.767
I bid for the items I want to buy.

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.880
(Laughter)

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.875
In two days, my grandmother
will be 82 years old,

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.290
and there's a 50 percent chance
for people over 80

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.171
to fall at least once per year,

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.259
which could lead to a broken hip
or even worse.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.415
Poor muscle tone and impaired balance
are the number one cause of falls,

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.526
so reversing these problems
through targeted exercise

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:06.196
will help keep older people
like my grandmother

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:09.029
safer and independent for longer.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.514
When my schedule ends,
MIRA briefly shows me

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:14.693
how I progressed throughout my session.

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:17.620
I have just shown you
three different games

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.113
for kids, adults and seniors.

00:04:20.113 --> 00:04:22.942
These can be used with orthopedic
or neurologic patients,

00:04:22.942 --> 00:04:25.886
but we'll soon have options
for children with autism,

00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:28.311
mental health or speech therapy.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.999
My physical therapist
can go back to my profile

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.990
and see the data gathered
during my sessions.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.660
She can see how much I moved,
how many points I scored,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.610
with what speed I moved my joints,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.841
and so on.

00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:43.118
My physical therapist can use all of this
to adapt my treatment.

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:45.947
I'm so pleased this version is now in use

00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:49.244
in over 10 clinics
across Europe and the U.S.,

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:51.197
and we're working on the home version.

00:04:51.197 --> 00:04:55.670
We want to enable physical therapists
to prescribe this digital treatment

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.310
and help patients play their way
to recovery at home.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.473
If my mom or I had a tool like this
when we needed physical therapy,

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:06.519
then we would have been more successful
following the treatment,

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:10.049
and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:11.651
Thank you.

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.031
(Applause)

00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:17.607
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me
what hardware is this

00:05:17.607 --> 00:05:19.470
that they're rapidly putting away?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.710
What is that made of,
and how much does it cost?

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.789
Cosmin Milhau: So it's
a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.534
but you just need a computer
and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.

00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:31.981
TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing
that people use for their Xboxes

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:33.052
to do 3D games, right?

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:36.113
CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,
you only need a camera.

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:38.875
TR: Right, so this is less
than a $1,000 solution.

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:41.458
CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,
you can definitely use it.

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:44.254
TR: So right now, you're doing
clinical trials in clinics.

00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:44.993
CM: Yes.

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:47.713
TR: And then the hope is to get it
so it's a home version

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.392
and I can do my exercise remotely,

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:52.922
and the therapist at the clinic
can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:53.989
CM: Exactly.

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:55.843
TR: Cool. Thanks so much.
CM: Thank you.

00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:56.584
(Applause)
