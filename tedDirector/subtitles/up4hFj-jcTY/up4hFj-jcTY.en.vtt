00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I have been teaching for a long time,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and in doing so

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
that I really wish more people would understand

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
about the potential of students.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
In 1931, my grandmother --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
bottom left for you guys over here --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
graduated from the eighth grade.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
She went to school to get the information

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
because that's where the information lived.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and she needed to go there to get the information,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
because that's how you learned.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Fast-forward a generation:

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And he again had to travel to the school

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to get the information from the teacher,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and take it with him,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
because that is how information was being transported

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
from teacher to student and then used in the world.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
When I was a kid,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
It was purchased the year I was born,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and it was extraordinary,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
The information was inside my house

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and it was awesome.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
This was different

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
than either generation had experienced before,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and it changed the way I interacted with information

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
even at just a small level.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
But the information was closer to me.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I could get access to it.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
In the time that passes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
between when I was a kid in high school

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and when I started teaching,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
we really see the advent of the Internet.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Right about the time that the Internet gets going

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
as an educational tool,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I take off from Wisconsin

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
where I had an opportunity to teach

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
in a lovely, small-town,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
rural Kansas school district,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
where I was teaching my favorite subject,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
American government.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
loved the political system.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Kids in the 12th grade:

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
not exactly all that enthusiastic

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
about the American government system.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And I put in front of them an authentic experience

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that allowed them to learn for themselves.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I posed a problem in front of them,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
They produced flyers. They called offices.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
They produced an election forum booklet

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
They invited everyone into the school

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
for an evening of conversation

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
about government and politics

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and whether or not the streets were done well,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and really had this robust experiential learning.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The older teachers -- more experienced --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
looked at me and went,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Laughter)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
"She doesn't know what she's in for."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But I knew that the kids would show up,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and I believed it,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And that night, all 90 kids --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
I had to just sit and watch.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
It meant something to them.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And they will step up.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
this time with middle school students.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Again, "thrilled" to learn.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
But what was interesting

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
was I had this really

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in a truly public school,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And one opportunity

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
which is the gentleman

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
The problem then becomes

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and deal with the subject in a way

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that is responsible and respectful,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and they know what to do with it.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
as an example of a gentleman

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.260
who singularly used his life to do something positive.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I then challenged the kids to identify

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It's the first time we'd done this.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It was the most awesome moment of revelation

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that when you ask kids to use their own voice

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and ask them to speak for themselves,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
what they're willing to share.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The last question of the assignment is:

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
how do you plan to use your life

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to positively impact other people?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
The things that kids will say

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
when you ask them and take the time to listen

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is extraordinary.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and the school district of Philadelphia.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We are a nine through 12 public school,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
but we do school quite differently.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I moved there primarily

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to be part of a learning environment

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and that really wanted to investigate

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
what was possible

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
when you are willing to let go

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
of some of the paradigms of the past,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and to a moment when we have information surplus.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So what do you do when the information is all around you?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Why do you have kids come to school

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
taking them home, getting access to information.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
when you've given the tool

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to acquire information to students,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
of allowing kids to fail

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
as part of the learning process.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
We deal right now in the educational landscape

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
with an infatuation

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
with the culture of one right answer

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and I am here to share with you:

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
it is not learning.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to tell kids to never be wrong.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
To ask them to always have the right answer

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
doesn't allow them to learn.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So we did this project,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I almost never show them off

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
My students produced these info-graphics

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
responding to the oil spill.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
of the info-graphics that existed

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
in a lot of mass media,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and produce one for themselves

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
of a different man-made disaster from American history.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And they had certain criteria to do it.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
They were a little uncomfortable with it,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
They can talk -- they're very smooth,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and they can write very, very well,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
was a little uncomfortable for them.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Go create. Go figure it out.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And the student that persistently

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
This was done in like two or three days.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And they immediately went, "There it is."

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Didn't read anything. "There it is."

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And I said, "Go read it."

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And then we went to another one --

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
or whether or not it was what I could create.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
It asked them to create for themselves,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and it allowed them to fail,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
process, learn from.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
they will do better this time,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
because learning

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
has to include an amount of failure,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
because failure is instructional

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
in the process.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
There are a million pictures

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that I could click through here,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
of students learning,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
of what learning can look like

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
in a landscape where we let go of the idea

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that kids have to come to school to get the information,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Ask them really interesting questions.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
They will not disappoint.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Ask them to go to places,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to see things for themselves,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
to actually experience the learning,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to play, to inquire.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
This is one of my favorite photos,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
because this was taken on Tuesday,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
when I asked the students to go to the polls.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
But this is learning too,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
The main point

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
is that, if we continue to look at education

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
as if it's about coming to school

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
to get the information

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
and not about experiential learning,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
empowering student voice and embracing failure,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
we're missing the mark.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And everything that everybody is talking about today

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that does not value these qualities,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
because we won't get there with a standardized test,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
We know how to do this better,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and it's time to do better.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.260
(Applause)
