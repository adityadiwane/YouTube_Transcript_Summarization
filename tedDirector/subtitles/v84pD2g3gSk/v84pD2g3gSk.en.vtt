00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:13.645
Hi.

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.837
Today I'm going to share
my personal journey

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:20.885
with female genital mutilation, FGM.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.557
Feel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.828
or do anything your body feels like doing.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.086
I'm not going to name
the things your body does.

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.302
I was born in Sierra Leone.

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:35.403
Did anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.888
If you have any thoughts --

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:42.096
I don't have any diamonds 
on me, by the way.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.355
If you have heard of Ebola,
well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:47.113
I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.527
Don't rush to the door.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.437
Be seated. You're fine.
I was checked before I got here.

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:56.246
My grandfather had three wives.

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:58.575
Don't ask me why a man
needs more than one wife.

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:00.584
Men, do you need more than one wife?

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:02.292
I don't think so. There you go.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.926
He was looking for a heart attack,
that's what I say.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:07.559
Oh yeah, he was.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.452
When I was three, war broke out
in Sierra Leone in 1991.

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:16.428
I remember literally going to bed
one night, everything was good.

00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:18.140
The next day, I woke up,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.081
bombs were dropping everywhere,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.662
and people were trying
to kill me and my family.

00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:27.465
We escaped the war and ended up
in Gambia, in West Africa.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:30.335
Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:32.868
While we were there as refugees,

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:36.684
we didn't know what
was going to become of us.

00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:38.573
My mom applied for refugee status.

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:41.304
She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:42.583
and we were lucky.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:45.393
Australia said, we will take you in.

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:47.129
Good job, Aussies.

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:51.350
Before we were meant to travel,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.192
my mom came home one day, and said,

00:01:53.192 --> 00:01:56.370
"We're going on 
a little holiday, a little trip."

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.668
She put us in a car,

00:01:57.668 --> 00:02:01.273
and we drove for hours
and ended up in a bush

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:03.928
in a remote area in Gambia.

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:07.677
In this bush, we found two huts.

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:11.899
An old lady came towards us.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.646
She was ethnic-looking, very old.

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.770
She had a chat with my mom, and went back.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.188
Then she came back and walked
away from us into a second hut.

00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:23.552
I'm standing there thinking,

00:02:23.552 --> 00:02:26.221
"This is very confusing.
I don't know what's going on."

00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.023
The next thing I knew,

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.989
my mom took me into this hut.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.065
She took my clothes off,

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:36.287
and then she pinned me down on the floor.

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:40.935
I struggled and tried
to get her off me, but I couldn't.

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:44.530
Then the old lady came towards me
with a rusty-looking knife,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.410
one of the sharp knives,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.613
orange-looking, has never seen
water or sunlight before.

00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:52.317
I thought she was going to slaughter me,

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:54.344
but she didn't.

00:02:54.344 --> 00:02:57.486
She slowly slid down my body

00:02:57.486 --> 00:03:00.893
and ended up where my vagina is.

00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:06.045
She took hold of what I now know
to be my clitoris,

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:13.663
she took that rusty knife,
and started cutting away, inch by inch.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:19.056
I screamed, I cried,

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:23.738
and asked my mom to get off me
so this pain will stop,

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:26.928
but all she did was say, "Be quiet."

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:32.956
This old lady sawed away at my flesh
for what felt like forever,

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:35.019
and then when she was done,

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.834
she threw that piece of flesh
across the floor

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:43.460
as if it was the most disgusting thing
she's ever touched.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.966
They both got off me,
and left me there bleeding,

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:52.811
crying, and confused
as to what just happened.

00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:55.805
We never talked about this again.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:59.280
Very soon, we found
that we were coming to Australia,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.015
and this is when you had
the Sydney Olympics at the time,

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:04.572
and people said we were going
to the end of the world,

00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:06.669
there was nowhere else
to go after Australia.

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.294
Yeah, that comforted us a bit.

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:11.607
It took us three days to get here.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:16.335
We went to Senegal, then France,
and then Singapore.

00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:19.144
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.

00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:23.864
We spent 15 minutes
opening the tap like this.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.651
Then somebody came in,

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:27.748
slid their hand under and water came out,

00:04:27.748 --> 00:04:30.255
and we thought, is this what we're in for?

00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:32.833
Like, seriously.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.641
We got to Adelaide, small place,

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.968
where literally they dumped us
in Adelaide, that's what I would say.

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.407
They dumped us there.

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:42.015
We were very grateful.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.678
We settled and we liked it.

00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:45.937
We were like, "We're home, we're here."

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.571
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:49.880
Adelaide has only one mall.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.946
It's this small place.

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.028
And we saw a lot of Asian people.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.230
My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.496
"You brought us to the wrong place.
You must take us back to Australia."

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.851
Yeah. It had to be explained to her that 
there were a lot of Asians in Australia

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.509
and we were in the right place.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.411
So fine, it's all good.

00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:15.166
My mom then had this brilliant idea

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:18.482
that I should go to a girls school
because they were less racist.

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:21.693
I don't know where she read 
that publication. (Laughter)

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:25.290
Never found evidence of it to this day.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.046
Six hundred white kids, 
and I was the only black child there.

00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:32.112
No, I was the only person
with a bit of a color on me.

00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:34.674
Let me say that. Chocolate color.

00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:38.055
There were no Asians, no indigenous.

00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:39.782
All we had was some tan girls,

00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:41.899
girls who felt the need
to be under the sun.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.684
It wasn't the same as my chocolate,
though. Not the same.

00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:48.382
Settling in Australia was quite hard,

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.700
but it became harder when I started
volunteering for an organization

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.212
called Women's Health Statewide,

00:05:55.552 --> 00:05:58.411
and I joined their
female genital mutilation program

00:05:58.411 --> 00:06:02.161
without any awareness of what
this program was actually about,

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:04.616
or that it related to me in any way.

00:06:04.616 --> 00:06:07.566
I spent months educating
nurses and doctors

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:10.103
about what female genital mutilation was

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.592
and where it was practiced:

00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:16.866
Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
and now, Australia and London and America,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.362
because, as we all know,
we live in a multicultural society,

00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:24.765
and people who come from those backgrounds
come with their culture,

00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:30.470
and sometimes they have cultural practices
that we may not agree with,

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.781
but they continue to practice them.

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.662
One day, I was looking at the chart

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:38.984
of the different types
of female genital mutilation,

00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:41.441
FGM, I will just say FGM for short.

00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:44.609
Type I is when they cut off the hood.

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:47.877
Type II is when
they cut off the whole clitoris

00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:52.002
and some of your labia majora,
or your outer lips,

00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:54.739
and Type III is when they 
cut off the whole clitoris

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.584
and then they sew you up

00:06:56.584 --> 00:07:00.687
so you only have a little hole
to pee and have your period.

00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:03.016
My eyes went onto Type II.

00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:05.306
Before all of this,
I pretty much had amnesia.

00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:08.733
I was in so much shock 
and traumatized by what had happened,

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:10.864
I didn't remember any of it.

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:13.139
Yes, I was aware something bad
happened to me,

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.351
but I had no recollection
of what had happened.

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.312
I knew I had a scar down there,

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.455
but I thought everybody
had a scar down there.

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:21.188
This had happened to everybody else.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:25.397
But when I looked at Type II,
it all came back to me.

00:07:25.397 --> 00:07:27.733
I remembered what was done to me.

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:29.740
I remembered being in that hut

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.569
with that old lady and my mom
holding me down.

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:39.214
Words cannot express the pain I felt,

00:07:39.214 --> 00:07:42.191
the confusion that I felt,

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:46.993
because now I realized that 
what was done to me was a terrible thing

00:07:46.993 --> 00:07:49.977
that in this society was called barbaric,

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:51.944
it was called mutilation.

00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:54.107
My mother had said
it was called circumcision,

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:56.327
but here it was mutilation.

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:59.384
I was thinking, I'm mutilated?
I'm a mutilated person.

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.114
Oh my God.

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.002
And then the anger came.

00:08:03.002 --> 00:08:07.002
I was a black angry woman.
(Laughter)

00:08:07.002 --> 00:08:08.379
Oh yeah.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:10.864
A little one, but angry nevertheless.

00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:15.720
I went home and said to my mom,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.665
"You did something."

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.551
This is not the African thing to do,
pointing at your mother,

00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:22.762
but hey, I was ready for any consequences.

00:08:22.762 --> 00:08:24.892
"You did something to me."

00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:27.250
She's like, "What are you
talking about, Khadija?"

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.936
She's used to me mouthing off.

00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:33.111
I'm like, "Those years ago,
You circumcised me.

00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:36.594
You cut away something
that belonged to me."

00:08:36.594 --> 00:08:38.414
She said, "Yes, I did.

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:41.384
I did it for your own good.

00:08:43.144 --> 00:08:45.232
It was in your best interest.

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:48.417
Your grandmother did it to me,
and I did it to you.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.368
It's made you a woman."

00:08:50.368 --> 00:08:52.120
I'm like, "How?"

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.206
She said, "You're empowered, Khadija.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.023
Do you get itchy down there?"

00:08:56.023 --> 00:08:58.341
I'm like, "No, why would I
get itchy down there?"

00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:01.020
She said, "Well,
if you were not circumcised,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.179
you would get itchy down there.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.314
Women who are not circumcised
get itchy all the time.

00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:09.373
Then they sleep around with everybody.

00:09:09.373 --> 00:09:12.185
You are not going
to sleep around with anybody."

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.919
And I thought,

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:19.147
her definition of empowerment
was very strange. (Laughter)

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.078
That was the end
of our first conversation.

00:09:23.078 --> 00:09:24.389
I went back to school.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:27.885
These were the days when we had 
Dolly and Girlfriend magazines.

00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:32.152
There was always the sealed section.
Anybody remember those sealed sections?

00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:34.226
The naughty bits, you know?

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:37.101
Oh yeah, I love those.
(Laughter)

00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:40.694
Anyway, there was always
an article about pleasure

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:43.960
and relationships and, of course, sex.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.966
But it always assumed
that you had a clitoris, though,

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:51.649
and I thought, this doesn't fit me.

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:54.467
This doesn't talk about people like me.

00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:56.120
I don't have a clitoris.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.272
I watched TV and those women
would moan like, "Oh! Oh!"

00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:03.275
I was like, these people
and their damned clitoris.

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:04.958
(Laughter)

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.991
What is a woman without a clitoris
supposed to do with her life?

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:10.524
That's what I want to know.

00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:14.394
I want to do that too --
"Oh! Oh!" and all of that.

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:16.072
Didn't happen.

00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:19.157
So I came home once again
and said to my mom,

00:10:19.157 --> 00:10:23.653
"Dolly and Girlfriend said
I deserve pleasure,

00:10:23.653 --> 00:10:25.596
that I should be having orgasms,

00:10:25.603 --> 00:10:30.248
and that white men should figure out
how to find the clitoris."

00:10:30.248 --> 00:10:33.504
Apparently, white men
have a problem finding the clitoris.

00:10:33.504 --> 00:10:35.410
(Laughter)

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.017
Just saying, it wasn't me.
It was Dolly that said that.

00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:43.608
And I thought to myself,
I had an inner joke in my head

00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:46.719
that said, "I will marry a white man.

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:50.300
He won't have that problem with me."
(Laughter)

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.836
So I said to my mom,

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:58.935
"Dolly and Girlfriend said
I deserve pleasure, and do you know

00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:02.720
what you have taken away from me,
what you have denied me?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.893
You have invaded me
in the most sacred way.

00:11:05.893 --> 00:11:07.446
I want pleasure.

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:10.751
I want to get horny, dammit, as well."

00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:13.469
And she said to me,
"Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?

00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:15.929
Are they your new friends, Khadija?"

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:19.784
I was like, "No, they're not.
That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."

00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:21.399
She didn't get it.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:23.507
We came from two different worlds.

00:11:23.507 --> 00:11:27.112
When she was growing up,
not having a clitoris was the norm.

00:11:27.112 --> 00:11:29.786
It was celebrated.

00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:32.153
I was an African Australian girl.

00:11:32.153 --> 00:11:35.962
I lived in a society
that was very clitoris-centric.

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:40.193
It was all about the damn clitoris!

00:11:40.193 --> 00:11:41.912
And I didn't have one!

00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:45.466
That pissed me off.

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:49.270
So once I went through
this strange phase of anger

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.976
and pain and confusion,

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:53.560
I remember booking
an appointment with my therapist.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.585
Yes, I'm an African 
who has a therapist. There you go.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:59.566
And I said to her,

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:02.001
"I was 13. I was a child.

00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:03.524
I was settling in a new country,

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:06.569
I was dealing with racism
and discrimination,

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:09.463
English is my third language,
and then there it was."

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:12.350
I said to her, "I feel like
I'm not a woman

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.774
because of what was done to me.

00:12:14.774 --> 00:12:17.530
I feel incomplete.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.901
Am I going to be asexual?"

00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:23.704
Because from what I knew about FGM,

00:12:23.704 --> 00:12:27.386
the whole aim of it was to control
the sexuality of women.

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:30.530
It's so that we don't have
any sexual desire.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.317
And I said, "Am I asexual now?

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.678
Will I just live the rest of my life
not feeling like having sex,

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:38.190
not enjoying sex?"

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.810
She couldn't answer my questions,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.463
so they went unanswered.

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:46.092
When I started having my period
around the age of 14,

00:12:46.092 --> 00:12:49.973
I realized I didn't have 
normal periods because of FGM.

00:12:49.973 --> 00:12:55.719
My periods were heavy, they were long,
and they were very painful.

00:12:55.726 --> 00:12:57.709
Then they told me I had fibroids.

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:00.336
They're like these little balls
sitting there.

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:03.080
One was covering one of my ovaries.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.165
And there came then the big news.

00:13:06.165 --> 00:13:09.416
"We don't think you can
have children, Khadija."

00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:14.138
And once again, I was
an angry black woman.

00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:17.313
I went home and I said to my mom,

00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:21.807
"Your act, your action,
no matter what your may defense may be" --

00:13:21.807 --> 00:13:24.401
because she thought she did it out love --

00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:29.029
"what you did out of love 
is harming me, and it's hurting me.

00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:32.851
What do you have to say for that?"

00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:36.035
She said, "I did what I had to do
as a mother."

00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:38.744
I'm still waiting
for an apology, by the way.

00:13:40.124 --> 00:13:42.511
Then I got married.

00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:45.949
And once again --

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:48.177
FGM is like the gift that keeps giving.

00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:50.862
You figure that out very soon.

00:13:50.862 --> 00:13:53.888
Sex was very painful.

00:13:53.888 --> 00:13:56.138
It hurt all the time.

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:59.836
And of course I realized, they said,
"You can't have kids."

00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:05.769
I thought, "Wow, is this my existence?
Is this what life is all about?"

00:14:08.843 --> 00:14:11.045
I'm proud to tell you,

00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:12.921
five months ago,

00:14:12.921 --> 00:14:15.435
I was told I was pregnant.

00:14:15.435 --> 00:14:19.831
(Applause)

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:25.842
I am the lucky girl.

00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:28.652
There are so many women out there
who have gone through FGM

00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:30.283
who have infertility.

00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:36.943
I know a nine-year-old girl who has
incontinence, constant infections, pain.

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:40.140
It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.286
It affects every area of your life,

00:14:43.286 --> 00:14:46.572
and this happened to me
because I was born a girl

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:48.301
in the wrong place.

00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:50.845
That's why it happened to me.

00:14:50.845 --> 00:14:55.117
I channel all that anger, 
all that pain, into advocacy

00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:58.587
because I needed my pain
to be worth something.

00:14:58.587 --> 00:15:02.658
So I'm the director of an organization
called No FGM Australia.

00:15:02.663 --> 00:15:04.107
You heard me right.

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:05.775
Why No FGM Australia?

00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:08.941
FGM is in Australia.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:12.606
Two days ago, I had to call
Child Protective Services,

00:15:12.606 --> 00:15:15.401
because somewhere in Australia,

00:15:15.401 --> 00:15:17.547
there's a four-year old

00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:22.277
there's a four-year-old whose mom 
is planning on performing FGM on her.

00:15:22.277 --> 00:15:28.381
That child is in kindy.
I'll let that sink in: four years old.

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:35.763
A couple of months ago, I met a lady
who is married to a Malaysian man.

00:15:35.763 --> 00:15:39.334
Her husband came home one day and said
he was going to take their daughters

00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:41.709
back to Malaysia
to cut off their clitoris.

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:45.443
And she said, "Why?"
He said they were dirty.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.728
And she said, "Well, you married me."

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:50.278
He said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief."

00:15:51.278 --> 00:15:54.163
They then went into a whole discussion
where she said to him,

00:15:54.163 --> 00:15:57.255
"Over my dead body
will you do that to my daughters."

00:15:57.255 --> 00:16:01.004
But imagine if this woman
wasn't aware of what FGM was,

00:16:01.004 --> 00:16:03.161
if they never had that conversation?

00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:06.399
Her children would have been
flown over to Malaysia

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:09.709
and they would have come back
changed for the rest of their lives.

00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:11.416
Do you know the millions of dollars

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.802
it would take us to deal
with an issue like that?

00:16:13.802 --> 00:16:16.561
[Three children per day] in Australia

00:16:16.561 --> 00:16:19.760
are at risk of having FGM
performed on them.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.261
This is an Australian problem, people.

00:16:22.261 --> 00:16:25.268
It's not an African problem.
It's not a Middle Eastern problem.

00:16:25.268 --> 00:16:30.411
It's not white, it's not black,
it has no color, it's everybody's problem.

00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.844
FGM is child abuse.

00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:35.754
It's violence against women.

00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:39.769
It's saying that women don't have
a right to sexual pleasure.

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:42.804
It says we don't have
a right to our bodies.

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:46.613
Well, I say no to that,
and you know what? Bullshit.

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:48.719
That's what I have to say to that.

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:53.600
(Applause)

00:16:54.999 --> 00:17:00.514
I am proud to say that
I'm doing my part in ending FGM.

00:17:00.514 --> 00:17:02.646
What are you going to do?

00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:07.297
There may be a child in your classroom
who is at risk of FGM.

00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:10.393
There may be a patient
who comes to your hospital

00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:12.026
who is at risk of FGM.

00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:14.385
But this is the reality,

00:17:14.385 --> 00:17:16.465
that even in our beloved Australia,

00:17:16.465 --> 00:17:18.567
the most wonderful place in the world,

00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:22.653
children are being abused
because of a culture.

00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:25.612
Culture should not be
a defense for child abuse.

00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:30.655
I want ever single one of you
to see FGM as an issue for you.

00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:32.141
Make it personal.

00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:35.230
It could be your daughter,
your sister, your cousin.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.391
I can't fight FGM alone.

00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:40.928
I could try, but I can't.

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:43.733
So my appeal to you is, please join me.

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:45.846
Sign my petition on Change.org

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:49.833
and type in Khadija, my name,
and it'll come up, and sign it.

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:53.425
The aim of that is to get support
for FGM victims in Australia

00:17:53.425 --> 00:17:55.688
and to protect little girls
growing up here

00:17:55.688 --> 00:17:58.826
to not have this evil done to them,

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:02.509
because every child
has a right to pleasure.

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:05.970
Every child has a right
to their bodies being left intact,

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.687
and dammit, ever child
has a right to a clitoris.

00:18:10.687 --> 00:18:14.352
So please join me in ending this act.

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:16.501
My favorite quote is,

00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:18.349
"All it takes for evil to prevail

00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:21.783
is for a few good men
and women to do nothing."

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:26.652
Are you going to let this evil
of female genital mutilation

00:18:26.652 --> 00:18:28.884
to prevail in Australia?

00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:30.172
I don't think so,

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:34.198
so please join me in ensuring
that it ends in my generation.

00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:36.269
Thank you.

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:38.707
(Applause)
