00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm here to share my photography.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Or is it photography?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Because, of course, this is a photograph

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
that you can't take with your camera.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Yet, my interest in photography started

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
as I got my first digital camera

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
at the age of 15.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
but it was a bit different,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
because using the camera,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
the process was in the planning instead.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And when you take a photograph with a camera,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.260
the process ends when you press the trigger.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So to me it felt like photography was more about

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
being at the right place and the right time.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I felt like anyone could do that.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
So I wanted to create something different,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
something where the process starts

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
when you press the trigger.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Photos like this:

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
construction going on along a busy road.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But it has an unexpected twist.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And despite that,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
it retains a level of realism.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Or photos like these --

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
both dark and colorful,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
but all with a common goal

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
of retaining the level of realism.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
When I say realism,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I mean photo-realism.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Because, of course,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
it's not something you can capture really,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
as a photograph.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
to figure out the trick.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So it's more about capturing an idea

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
than about capturing a moment really.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
But what's the trick

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that makes it look realistic?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Is it something about the details

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
or the colors?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Is it something about the light?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
What creates the illusion?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It's not really what is realistic,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.260
it's what we think looks realistic really.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So I think the basics

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
are quite simple.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I just see it as a puzzle of reality

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to create alternate reality.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And let me show you a simple example.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
But combined in a certain way,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
like it could exist.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
But at the same time, we know it can't.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So we trick our brains,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that it doesn't really make sense.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And I see the same process

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
with combining photographs.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
It's just really about combining different realities.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
I think it's the things that we don't even think about,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
the things all around us in our daily lives.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
But when combining photographs,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
this is really important to consider,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
to achieve a realistic result.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
As you can see, these images aren't really special.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.260
But combined, they can create something like this.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
So the first rule is that photos combined

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
should have the same perspective.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Secondly, photos combined

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
should have the same type of light.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260
shot at the same height and in the same type of light.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
where the different images begin and end

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
by making it seamless.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Make it impossible to say

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
how the image actually was composed.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So by matching color, contrast and brightness

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
in the borders between the different images,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
adding photographic defects

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
like depth of field,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
desaturated colors and noise,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
we erase the borders between the different images

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and make it look like one single image,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
despite the fact that one image

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
can contain hundreds of layers basically.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So here's another example.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and the lower part is what's manipulated.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But this image is actually entirely composed

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
of photographs from different locations.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
than to find a place,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
because then you don't need to compromise

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
with the ideas in your head.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
But it does require a lot of planning.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And getting this idea during winter,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
I knew that I had several months to plan it,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
to find the different locations

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
for the pieces of the puzzle basically.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
So for example,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
the fish was captured on a fishing trip.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
The shores are from a different location.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to make it look more Swedish.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
So to achieve a realistic result,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I think it comes down to planning.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.260
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Then it's about combining the different photographs.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And here every piece is very well planned.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the result can be quite beautiful

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and also quite realistic.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So all the tools are out there,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and the only thing that limits us

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.260
is our imagination.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Thank you.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
(Applause)
