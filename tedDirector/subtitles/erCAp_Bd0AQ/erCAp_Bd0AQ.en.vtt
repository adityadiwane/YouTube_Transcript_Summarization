00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.620
Four years ago,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.422
a security researcher,

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:20.671
or, as most people would call it, a hacker,

00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:22.838
found a way to literally

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:26.041
make ATMs throw money at him.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.382
His name was Barnaby Jack,

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:33.041
and this technique was later called "jackpotting"

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.950
in his honor.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.799
I'm here today because I think

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.850
we actually need hackers.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.712
Barnaby Jack

00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:43.199
could have easily turned

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.397
into a career criminal or James Bond villain

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:48.893
with his knowledge,

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.381
but he chose to show the world

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:54.070
his research instead.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.923
He believed that sometimes

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.963
you have to demo a threat

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.880
to spark a solution.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.810
And I feel the same way.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.660
That's why I'm here today.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.938
We are often terrified and fascinated

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:11.399
by the power hackers now have.

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.131
They scare us.

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.116
But the choices they make

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.286
have dramatic outcomes

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:20.274
that influence us all.

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:23.609
So I am here today because I think we need hackers,

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.192
and in fact, they just might be

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:31.532
the immune system for the information age.

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:33.565
Sometimes they make us sick,

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:36.920
but they also find those hidden threats

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.244
in our world,

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:41.089
and they make us fix it.

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.447
I knew that I might get hacked

00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:45.855
for giving this talk,

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.328
so let me save you the effort.

00:01:48.328 --> 00:01:50.162
In true TED fashion,

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:54.135
here is my most embarrassing picture.

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.005
But it would be difficult for you to find me in it,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.743
because I'm the one who looks like a boy

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:02.548
standing to the side.

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:04.930
I was such a nerd back then

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.532
that even the boys on the
Dungeons and Dragons team

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.729
wouldn't let me join.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.714
This is who I was,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:15.829
but this is who I wanted to be:

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.727
Angelina Jolie.

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:19.282
She portrayed Acid Burn

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.776
in the '95 film "Hackers."

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:24.954
She was pretty and she could rollerblade,

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:29.063
but being a hacker, that made her powerful.

00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:31.523
And I wanted to be just like her,

00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:33.889
so I started spending a lot of time

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.774
on hacker chat rooms and online forums.

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:39.107
I remember one late night

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:41.368
I found a bit of PHP code.

00:02:41.368 --> 00:02:42.990
I didn't really know what it did,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.615
but I copy-pasted it

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.329
and used it anyway

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.802
to get into a password-protected site

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:50.606
like that.

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.009
Open Sesame.

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.531
It was a simple trick,

00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:56.536
and I was just a script kiddie back then,

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:57.974
but to me, that trick,

00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:00.189
it felt like this,

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.633
like I had discovered limitless potential

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.424
at my fingertips.

00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:07.733
This is the rush of power that hackers feel.

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:10.637
It's geeks just like me

00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:13.869
discovering they have access to superpower,

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.496
one that requires the skill and tenacity

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.004
of their intellect,

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.565
but thankfully no radioactive spiders.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:23.406
But with great power

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.710
comes great responsibility,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.374
and you all like to think that if we had such powers,

00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:31.653
we would only use them for good.

00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:35.000
But what if you could read your ex's emails,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.112
or add a couple zeros to your bank account.

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:40.132
What would you do then?

00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:42.369
Indeed, many hackers do not resist

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.357
those temptations,

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:47.482
and so they are responsible in one way or another

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:49.886
to billions of dollars lost each year

00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:53.147
to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:55.025
which is a serious issue.

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:57.010
But there are other hackers,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.772
hackers who just like to break things,

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.480
and it is precisely those hackers

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.773
that can find the weaker elements in our world

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:07.450
and make us fix it.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.370
This is what happened last year

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.379
when another security researcher

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.944
called Kyle Lovett

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:14.501
discovered a gaping hole

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.461
in the design of certain wireless routers

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.000
like you might have in your home or office.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.645
He learned that anyone could remotely connect

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:24.967
to these devices over the Internet

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.728
and download documents from hard drives

00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:29.903
attached to those routers,

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:31.750
no password needed.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.087
He reported it to the company, of course,

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:36.401
but they ignored his report.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.265
Perhaps they thought universal access

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:41.250
was a feature, not a bug,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.105
until two months ago

00:04:43.105 --> 00:04:44.538
when a group of hackers used it

00:04:44.538 --> 00:04:46.992
to get into people's files.

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:49.393
But they didn't steal anything.

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:51.410
They left a note:

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.288
Your router and your documents

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:55.447
can be accessed by anyone in the world.

00:04:55.447 --> 00:04:57.715
Here's what you should do to fix it.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:00.093
We hope we helped.

00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:02.623
By getting into people's files like that,

00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:04.083
yeah, they broke the law,

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.551
but they also forced that company

00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:08.532
to fix their product.

00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:10.700
Making vulnerabilities known to the public

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.445
is a practice called full disclosure

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.047
in the hacker community,

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:17.081
and it is controversial,

00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.613
but it does make me think of how hackers

00:05:19.613 --> 00:05:22.599
have an evolving effect on technologies we use

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.095
every day.

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:26.373
This is what Khalil did.

00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:28.988
Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,

00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:32.997
and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook

00:05:32.997 --> 00:05:34.847
which he attempted to report

00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:37.837
through the company's bug bounty program.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.494
These are usually great arrangements for companies

00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:43.671
to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities

00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:45.360
they find in their code.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.910
Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.946
his report was not acknowledged.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.791
Frustrated with the exchange,

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:57.068
he took to use his own discovery

00:05:57.068 --> 00:06:00.203
to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.

00:06:00.203 --> 00:06:02.970
This got their attention, all right,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.265
and they fixed the bug,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.120
but because he hadn't reported it properly,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.345
he was denied the bounty usually paid out

00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:13.349
for such discoveries.

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.338
Thankfully for Khalil,

00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:18.224
a group of hackers were watching out for him.

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:22.033
In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.111
to reward him for this discovery,

00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.311
raising a vital discussion in the technology industry

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:30.370
about how we come up with incentives

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.960
for hackers to do the right thing.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.980
But I think there's a greater story here still.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.915
Even companies founded by hackers,

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:41.302
like Facebook was,

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:43.885
still have a complicated relationship

00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:45.689
when it comes to hackers.

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:48.520
And so for more conservative organizations,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.038
it is going to take time and adapting

00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:54.620
in order to embrace hacker culture

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.741
and the creative chaos that it brings with it.

00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.183
But I think it's worth the effort,

00:07:00.183 --> 00:07:02.163
because the alternative,

00:07:02.163 --> 00:07:05.993
to blindly fight all hackers,

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.581
is to go against the power you cannot control

00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:11.882
at the cost of stifling innovation

00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:14.076
and regulating knowledge.

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:18.370
These are things that will come back and bite you.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.848
It is even more true

00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:21.927
if we go after hackers

00:07:21.927 --> 00:07:24.964
that are willing to risk their own freedom

00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:27.867
for ideals like the freedom of the web,

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:31.930
especially in times like this, like today even,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.550
as governments and corporates

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.776
fight to control the Internet.

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:40.100
I find it astounding

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.113
that someone from the shadowy
corners of cyberspace

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:45.928
can become its voice of opposition,

00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:48.570
its last line of defense even,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.987
perhaps someone like Anonymous,

00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:55.840
the leading brand of global hacktivism.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.100
This universal hacker movement

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.706
needs no introduction today,

00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.809
but six years ago

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:05.238
they were not much more than an Internet subculture

00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:08.157
dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats

00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:11.587
and Internet trolling campaigns.

00:08:11.587 --> 00:08:16.429
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.079
when the Church of Scientology

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:21.146
attempted to remove certain leaked videos

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:25.549
from appearing on certain websites.

00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:27.989
This is when Anonymous was forged

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:30.620
out of the seemingly random collection

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.363
of Internet dwellers.

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.817
It turns out,

00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:36.146
the Internet doesn't like it

00:08:36.146 --> 00:08:38.769
when you try to remove things from it,

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.739
and it will react with cyberattacks

00:08:41.739 --> 00:08:43.840
and elaborate pranks

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.489
and with a series of organized protests

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:47.834
all around the world,

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.822
from my hometown of Tel Aviv

00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:52.066
to Adelaide, Australia.

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:55.196
This proved that Anonymous and this idea

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:58.279
can rally the masses from the keyboards

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.855
to the streets,

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:01.802
and it laid the foundations

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:04.020
for dozens of future operations

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.960
against perceived injustices

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.316
to their online and offline world.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:11.341
Since then, they've gone after many targets.

00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:14.130
They've uncovered corruption, abuse.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.950
They've hacked popes and politicians,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.627
and I think their effect is larger

00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:21.424
than simple denial of service attacks

00:09:21.424 --> 00:09:22.800
that take down websites

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.438
or even leak sensitive documents.

00:09:26.438 --> 00:09:29.480
I think that, like Robin Hood,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.380
they are in the business of redistribution,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.112
but what they are after isn't your money.

00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:40.842
It's not your documents. It's your attention.

00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:45.382
They grab the spotlight for causes they support,

00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:48.013
forcing us to take note,

00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:50.478
acting as a global magnifying glass

00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:52.622
for issues that we are not as aware of

00:09:52.622 --> 00:09:54.731
but perhaps we should be.

00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:56.584
They have been called many names

00:09:56.584 --> 00:09:58.355
from criminals to terrorists,

00:09:58.355 --> 00:10:01.801
and I cannot justify their illegal means,

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.942
but the ideas they fight for

00:10:03.942 --> 00:10:07.968
are ones that matter to us all.

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:09.951
The reality is,

00:10:09.951 --> 00:10:12.756
hackers can do a lot more than break things.

00:10:12.756 --> 00:10:15.229
They can bring people together.

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.552
And if the Internet doesn't like it

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:20.199
when you try to remove things from it,

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:21.100
just watch what happens

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.929
when you try to shut the Internet down.

00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:28.521
This took place in Egypt in January 2011,

00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.737
and as President Hosni Mubarak

00:10:31.737 --> 00:10:33.791
attempted a desperate move

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:37.633
to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,

00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:39.503
he sent his personal troops

00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:43.146
down to Egypt's Internet service providers

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.617
and had them physically kill the switch

00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:49.862
on the country's connection to the world overnight.

00:10:49.862 --> 00:10:51.477
For a government to do a thing like that

00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:53.196
was unprecedented,

00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:56.660
and for hackers, it made it personal.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.748
Hackers like the Telecomix group

00:10:58.748 --> 00:11:00.621
were already active on the ground,

00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:03.439
helping Egyptians bypass censorship

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:05.929
using clever workarounds like Morse code

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:07.957
and ham radio.

00:11:07.957 --> 00:11:10.086
It was high season for low tech,

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.650
which the government couldn't block,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.892
but when the Net went completely down,

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:18.830
Telecomix brought in the big guns.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.001
They found European service providers

00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:23.310
that still had 20-year-old

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.890
analog dial-up access infrastructure.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.292
They opened up 300 of those lines

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:31.766
for Egyptians to use,

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:34.603
serving slow but sweet Internet connection

00:11:34.603 --> 00:11:36.004
for Egyptians.

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:37.299
This worked.

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:39.092
It worked so well, in fact,

00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:41.372
one guy even used it to download an episode

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:45.710
of "How I Met Your Mother."

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.631
But while Egypt's future is still uncertain,

00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:52.284
when the same thing happened in Syria

00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:53.804
just one year later,

00:11:53.804 --> 00:11:57.539
Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,

00:11:57.539 --> 00:11:58.708
and Anonymous,

00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:00.954
they were perhaps the first international group

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.658
to officially denounce the actions

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:04.571
of the Syrian military

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:07.375
by defacing their website.

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:10.867
But with this sort of power,

00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:13.213
it really depends on where you stand,

00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:16.722
because one man's hero

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:18.969
can be another's villain,

00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:21.367
and so the Syrian Electronic Army

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:23.838
is a pro-Assad group of hackers

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:26.503
who support his contentious regime.

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:29.185
They've taken down multiple high-profile targets

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:30.820
in the past few years,

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.203
including the Associated Press's Twitter account,

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:37.219
in which they posted a message

00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:39.375
about an attack on the White House

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.638
injuring President Obama.

00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:44.783
This tweet was fake, of course,

00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:47.722
but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index

00:12:47.722 --> 00:12:51.099
that day was most certainly not,

00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:54.361
and a lot of people lost a lot of money.

00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:58.267
This sort of thing is happening
all over the world right now.

00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:01.214
In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.576
to Latin America,

00:13:03.576 --> 00:13:05.880
from Europe to the United States,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.937
hackers are a force for social,

00:13:08.937 --> 00:13:12.703
political and military influence.

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:14.954
As individuals or in groups,

00:13:14.954 --> 00:13:17.594
volunteers or military conflicts,

00:13:17.594 --> 00:13:20.235
there are hackers everywhere.

00:13:20.235 --> 00:13:22.330
They come from all walks of life,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.254
ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.

00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:31.053
They are now shaping the world's stage.

00:13:31.053 --> 00:13:33.898
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:36.062
in the 21st century.

00:13:36.062 --> 00:13:38.599
This is because access to information

00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:41.912
is a critical currency of power,

00:13:41.912 --> 00:13:44.878
one which governments would like to control,

00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:47.339
a thing they attempt to do by setting up

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:50.999
all-you-can-eat surveillance programs,

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:53.737
a thing they need hackers for, by the way.

00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:56.384
And so the establishment has long had

00:13:56.384 --> 00:14:00.091
a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,

00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.849
because the same people who demonize hacking

00:14:02.849 --> 00:14:07.931
also utilize it at large.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.179
Two years ago,

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.952
I saw General Keith Alexander.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:16.170
He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.878
but instead of his four star general uniform,

00:14:19.878 --> 00:14:22.174
he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:23.918
This was at DEF CON,

00:14:23.918 --> 00:14:27.023
the world's largest hacker conference.

00:14:27.023 --> 00:14:28.950
Perhaps like me, General Alexander

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.770
didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.881
I think he saw untapped potential.

00:14:35.881 --> 00:14:39.254
In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.894
"In this room right here," he said,

00:14:41.894 --> 00:14:44.284
"is the talent our nation needs."

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:47.664
Well, hackers in the back row replied,

00:14:47.664 --> 00:14:49.790
"Then stop arresting us."

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.224
(Applause)

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:55.803
Indeed, for years,

00:14:55.803 --> 00:14:58.619
hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,

00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:01.527
but in light of what we know now,

00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:05.800
who is more watchful of our online world?

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.806
The rules of the game are not that clear anymore,

00:15:08.806 --> 00:15:12.218
but hackers are perhaps the only ones

00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:16.101
still capable of challenging
overreaching governments

00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.316
and data-hoarding corporates

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:20.794
on their own playing field.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.914
To me, that represents hope.

00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:25.238
For the past three decades,

00:15:25.238 --> 00:15:26.789
hackers have done a lot of things,

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:30.006
but they have also impacted civil liberties,

00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:32.376
innovation and Internet freedom,

00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:35.305
so I think it's time we take a good look

00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:37.435
at how we choose to portray them,

00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:41.019
because if we keep expecting
them to be the bad guys,

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:44.489
how can they be the heroes too?

00:15:44.489 --> 00:15:46.500
My years in the hacker world

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.142
have made me realize

00:15:48.142 --> 00:15:53.875
both the problem and the beauty about hackers:

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:57.033
They just can't see something broken in the world

00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:58.680
and leave it be.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.360
They are compelled

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.890
to either exploit it or try and change it,

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.806
and so they find the vulnerable aspects

00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:09.940
in our rapidly changing world.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.282
They make us, they force us to fix things

00:16:14.282 --> 00:16:16.001
or demand something better,

00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:17.995
and I think we need them

00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:20.201
to do just that,

00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:23.470
because after all, it is not information

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.575
that wants to be free, it's us.

00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:29.937
Thank you very much.

00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:32.295
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:34.180
Hack the planet!
