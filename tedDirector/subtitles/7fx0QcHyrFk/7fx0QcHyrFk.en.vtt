00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So I just want to tell you my story.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I spend a lot of time

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
teaching adults how to use visual language

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and doodling in the workplace.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and counter to serious learning.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
But I have a problem with that belief,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
because I know that doodling has a profound impact

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
on the way that we can process information

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and the way that we can solve problems.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
between the way our society perceives doodling

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and the way that the reality is.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So I discovered some very interesting things.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
For example, there's no such thing

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
as a flattering definition of a doodle.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
as in Yankee Doodle.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
In the 18th century, it became a verb,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
at least to me, which is the following:

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
To doodle officially means

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
to dawdle,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to dilly dally, to monkey around,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
to make meaningless marks,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
to do something of little value, substance or import,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and -- my personal favorite --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
to do nothing.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
it's totally inappropriate.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
(Laughter)

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Additionally, I've heard horror stories

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And unfortunately,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
the press tends to reinforce this norm

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
when they're reporting on a doodling scene --

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
they typically use words like "discovered"

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
or "caught" or "found out,"

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
thank you, Freud.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
In the 1930s, Freud told us all

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that you could analyze people's psyches

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
based on their doodles.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
at the Davos Forum in 2005,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
when his doodles were, of course, "discovered"

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and he was labeled the following things.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
(Laughter)

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
But that does contribute

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
to people not wanting to share their doodles.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
I think that our culture

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is so intensely focused on verbal information

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And I'm not comfortable with that.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And here's the truth:

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
So here's a new definition for doodling.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
because I want to talk to you later.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Here's the real definition:

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
That is why millions of people doodle.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
retain more of that information

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
than their non-doodling counterparts.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
but in reality, it is a preemptive measure

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to stop you from losing focus.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Additionally, it has a profound effect

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
on creative problem-solving

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and deep information processing.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
There are four ways that learners intake information

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
so that they can make decisions.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
They are visual, auditory,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
reading and writing and kinesthetic.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Now in order for us to really chew on information

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and do something with it,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
we have to engage at least two of those modalities,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
or we have to engage one of those modalities

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
coupled with an emotional experience.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
The incredible contribution of the doodle

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
with the possibility of an emotional experience.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
That is a pretty solid contribution

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
for a behavior equated with doing nothing.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
This is so nerdy,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
but this made me cry when I discovered this.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
So they did anthropological research

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
into the unfolding of artistic activity in children,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and they found that, across space and time,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
as they grow.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
In other words, they have a shared and growing

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
complexity in visual language

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that happens in a predictable order.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And I think that is incredible.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I think that means doodling is native to us

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
but the doodle is a precursor

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to some of our greatest cultural assets.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
This is but one:

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
So here is my point:

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
from a classroom or a boardroom

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
or even the war room.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
On the contrary,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
where information density is very high

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and the need for processing that information is very high.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And I will go you one further.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Because doodling is so universally accessible

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and it is not intimidating as an art form,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
it can be leveraged as a portal

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
through which we move people

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
into higher levels of visual literacy.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
My friends, the doodle has never been

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
the nemesis of intellectual thought.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Thank you.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
(Applause)
