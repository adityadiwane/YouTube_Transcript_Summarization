00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
You know, cadaver dissection

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
For students, it's quite an experience,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
but for a school, it could be very difficult

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
or expensive to maintain.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.260
So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
cadavers may not be easily available.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
So to address this, we developed

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.260
So we call this Anatomage Table.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
So with this Anatomage Table,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
students can experience

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
the dissection without a human cadaver.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And the table form is important,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and since it's touch-interactive,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.260
just like the way they do dissections in the lab,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
you can literally interact with your table.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Our digital body is one-to-one life size,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
so this is exactly the way

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
students will see the real anatomy.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
I'm going to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
do some demonstrations.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
As you can see,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I use my finger to interact with my digital body.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm going to do some cuts.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Then it's going to show inside.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And I can change my cut

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to see different parts.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Maybe I can cut there,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
see the brain,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and I can change my cut.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
You can see some internal organs.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So we call this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the slicer mode.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
OK, I'm going to do another cut.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Right there.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
This shows a lot of internal structures.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So if I want to see the back side,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I can flip

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and see from behind.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Like this.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So if these images are

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
that means we did the right job.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So our doctors said

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
these are eye candies.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So instead of just butchering the body,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
What I'm going to do is

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
just to see a few internal organs.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Right here.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Let's say I'm going to cut

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the liver right here.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.260
OK.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I'm going to do some surgery here.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.260
I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Oops! ...

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
(Laughter)

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Laughter)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Okay.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
All right then.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Let me zoom in.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I'm going to make a cut right there.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And then you can see the inside of the heart.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
You can see the atrium and the ventricles,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
how blood flows to our arteries and veins.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Just like this,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
students can isolate anybody

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and dissect any way you want to.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
It doesn't have to be always dissection.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So let me show you,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
I'm going to start with the skeletal structure,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and I can add a few internal organs.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Yep.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Maybe I can add quickly this way.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And I can build muscles

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
gradually,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
just like that.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
We can see tendons and muscles.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Wish I could build my muscle this fast.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Laughter)

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And this is another way to learn anatomy.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Another thing I can show you is,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
more often than not,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
doctors get to meet patients

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in X-ray form.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Anatomage Table shows

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.260
You can also interact with your X-ray,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and also if you want,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
you can compare

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
with how anatomy would appear

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
in X-ray, too.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So when you are done,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
just bring back the body

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and then it's ready for another session.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
It looks like our table

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
also can transform gender, too.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It's a female now.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
(Applause)
