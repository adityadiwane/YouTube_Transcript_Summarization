00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I thought to myself that well, it's TED.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.160
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
to justify my participation in something like that?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
might help things a bit.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
and just talk the way I really talk

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
because I am from Queens, New York.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.160
(Laughter)

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
I suppose it's fair to say

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
But then what?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
And well, they're very excited.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
What I should tell you --

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
(Laughter)

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Oh, wonderful.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Good evening everybody.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
Thank you so very much for having me here today.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Oh my! There's so many of you.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Hi sweetheart. Okay.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
(Laughter)

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
She's a very nice, young black girl.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
Well you know, she calls herself black --

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
But anyway.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
(Laughter)

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
She has me here because she puts me in her show,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
what she calls her one-woman show.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
And you know what that means, of course.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
But I don't mind.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Really, it's amazing.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
but the celebrities.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
There are so many celebrities running around here.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
Isn't that adorable?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
(Laughter)

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
You know, she's only half Jewish.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Did you know that about her?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Yeah, she's lovely.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
you're all so young.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
You know, your parents must be very proud.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
I noticed it's very multicultural.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
It's like a rainbow.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
What are you allowed to say or not say?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
But anyway, you know,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
I just think that to be here with all of you

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
accomplished young people --

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.160
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
You know, it's heartening to me.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
absolutely horrifying.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
It's true. It's true.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
You know, between the environmental degradation

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
Anyway.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160
(Laughter)

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
to get us out of this mess.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Thank you for all that you do.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
So, happy continued success.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Congratulations. Mazel tov.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.160
(Applause)

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Hi. Hi.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Thank you everybody.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
My name is Noraida. And I'm just --

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
that you're doing and everything like that.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I am Dominican-American.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And I think he's Mexican, so that's --

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
(Laughter)

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
I just -- I'm sorry.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160
as you can imagine.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.160
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
that this even exists.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
I like that.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.160
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
which is like a leadership thing,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
And the organization is called DA BOMB,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
but with the war on terror and everything,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
So, basically like DA BOMB --

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:25.160
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
and who also happen to be mothers like me.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
Right now it's very exciting actually for me

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
that's my new title.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.160
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
like something like this is so vital

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
So, I think all people, we need that,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.160
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.160
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
making the talks available online.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
That's very good. I love that.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
Thank you very much.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
(Laughter)

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.160
(Applause)

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
So, that was Noraida,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
friends, neighbors, family members.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
I come from a multicultural family.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
In fact, the older lady you just met:

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
It's a long story, believe me.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
But on top of my family background,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
where I encountered a plethora of new characters,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160
including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.160
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
you know, she was kind of typically French.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.160
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.160
But [German].

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
Yes, I took German for three years, [German],

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
even in the UN school.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Although, you know, it was wonderful.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Never. He always, always treated each of us,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
you know, equally unbearably during the class.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
classmates from everywhere,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.160
And they've inspired many characters as well.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
For example, a friend of mine.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
But, you know, I am originally from India,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
and I wanted to start by telling you

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
to come here to TED in California,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
trying to make me feel comfortable

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
So, you can just imagine -- right.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.160
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:38.160
(Applause)

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.160
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
I'm trying to behave myself,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
it's my first time here.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
Uh, well, thank you.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
Good evening.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
My name is Pauline Ning,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160
and first I want to tell you that I'm --

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.160
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.160
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.160
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.160
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
much less like this

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
because I did not like to give speeches

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:42.160
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.160
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160
I try anyway.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160
(Laughter)

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
But my background --

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
I want to tell you story only briefly.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.160
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
and they would always answer me back in English.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
But when they got older,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:41.160
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
But that's where we had some problems.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.160
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.160
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
But I think he will change his mind soon.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.160
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
But first, she said she's not interested.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
She only wants to spend time with her friends.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160
And then at college, it's like she never came home.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.160
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.160
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
because I don't like them."

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
(Laughter)

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:47.160
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.160
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
I am lesbian."

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.160
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.160
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160
(Laughter) --

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:14.160
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
(Laughter)

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
but from my son, not my daughter.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.160
(Laughter)

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
But at first I did not know what to do.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:44.160
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160
So, even though sometimes it's still hard,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160
I will share with you that it helps me to realize

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.160
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
because of ideas like this,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
and people like you, with an open mind.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.160
in the ways maybe even you don't realize.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
So, for my daughter's sake,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.160
I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Thank you. Xie xie.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:31.160
(Applause)

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.160
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
to be last today.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
I am originally from Jordan.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
It is not Harvard.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
But I am very proud of my students.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.160
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:15.160
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:21.160
I do like to make the point that we in global society,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.160
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.160
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.160
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
So, back in the ancient times.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:57.160
[Arabic]

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160
And this roughly translates:

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160
"Please, let me hold your hand.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.160
I want to hold your hand.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
I want to hold your hand.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.160
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.160
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:27.160
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.160
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
listening to the Beatles.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.160
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.160
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:57.160
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.160
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.160
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.160
Okay? Great.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160
(Applause)

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
Thank you for having me.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.160
(Applause)

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.160
Thank you very, very much. I love you.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.160
(Applause)

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.160
Well, you have to let me say this.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.160
I just -- thank you.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.160
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.160
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
And I know I've performed for some of your companies

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
or some of you have seen me elsewhere,

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.160
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.160
(Applause)
