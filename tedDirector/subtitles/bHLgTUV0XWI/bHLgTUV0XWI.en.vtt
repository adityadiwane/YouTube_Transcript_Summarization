00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
For a long time,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
there was me, and my body.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Me was composed of stories,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
of cravings, of strivings,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
of desires of the future.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Me was trying

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
not to be an outcome of my violent past,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
but the separation that had already occurred

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
between me and my body

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
was a pretty significant outcome.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Me was always trying to become something, somebody.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Me only existed in the trying.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
My body was often in the way.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Me was a floating head.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
For years, I actually only wore hats.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It was a way of keeping my head attached.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
It was a way of locating myself.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I worried that [if] I took my hat off

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I wouldn't be here anymore.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I actually had a therapist who once said to me,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
All this time I lived in the city

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
because, to be honest,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I was afraid of trees.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I never had babies

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
because heads cannot give birth.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
As I had no reference point for my body,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I began to ask other women about their bodies --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
in particular, their vaginas,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
because I thought vaginas were kind of important.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,"

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
which led to me obsessively and incessantly

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
talking about vaginas everywhere I could.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I did this in front of many strangers.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
One night on stage,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I actually entered my vagina.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It was an ecstatic experience.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
It scared me, it energized me,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and then I became a driven person,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
a driven vagina.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I began to see my body like a thing,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
a thing that could move fast,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
like a thing that could accomplish other things,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
many things, all at once.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I would drive it and demand things from it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It had no limits. It was invincible.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I didn't heed it;

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
no, I organized it and I directed it.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I didn't have patience for my body;

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
I snapped it into shape.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I was greedy.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I took more than my body had to offer.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
the way an abusive parent

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
can sometimes have a moment of kindness.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
My father was really kind to me

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
on my 16th birthday, for example.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
I heard people murmur from time to time

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
that I should love my body,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
so I learned how to do this.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
But all that was just a more sophisticated way

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to manipulate my body --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
a further disassociation,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
like planting a vegetable field on a freeway.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
many women started to tell me about theirs --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
their stories about their bodies.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Actually, these stories compelled me around the world,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
and I've been to over 60 countries.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I heard thousands of stories,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and I have to tell you, there was always this moment

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
where the women shared with me

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that particular moment when she separated from her body --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
when she left home.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I heard about women being molested in their beds,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
flogged in their burqas,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
left for dead in parking lots,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
acid burned in their kitchens.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Some women became quiet and disappeared.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
In the middle of my traveling,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I turned 40 and I began to hate my body,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
which was actually progress,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
because at least my body existed enough to hate it.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
It was proof that I had not measured up,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.260
or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
My stomach was proof that I had failed,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that it had failed me, that it was broken.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
In fact, it became so extreme

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I wrote a play about it.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
But the more I talked about it,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
the more objectified and fragmented my body became.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
something I was selling.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Then I went somewhere else.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
I went outside

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
what I thought I knew.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And I heard stories

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
that shattered all the other stories.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I heard stories

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that got inside my body.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I heard about a little girl

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
who couldn't stop peeing on herself

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because so many grown soldiers

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
had shoved themselves inside her.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
I heard an 80-year-old woman

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and twisted up on her head

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
as the soldiers raped her like that.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
There are thousands of these stories,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and many of the women had holes in their bodies --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
holes, fistula --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that were the violation of war --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
holes in the fabric of their souls.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
These stories saturated my cells and nerves,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and to be honest,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I stopped sleeping for three years.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
All the stories began to bleed together.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
The raping of the Earth,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the pillaging of minerals,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
the destruction of vaginas --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
none of these were separate anymore

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
from each other or me.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Militias were raping six-month-old babies

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
so that countries far away

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
could get access to gold and coltan

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
for their iPhones and computers.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
My body had not only become a driven machine,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
but it was responsible now

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
for destroying other women's bodies

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
in its mad quest to make more machines

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Then I got cancer --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
or I found out I had cancer.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It arrived like a speeding bird

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
smashing into a windowpane.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Suddenly, I had a body,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
a body that was pricked

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and poked and punctured,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
a body that was cut wide open,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
a body that had organs removed

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and transported and rearranged and reconstructed,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
a body that was scanned

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and had tubes shoved down it,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
a body that was burning from chemicals.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Cancer exploded

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
the wall of my disconnection.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
was the crisis in the world,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and it wasn't happening later,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
it was happening now.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
the cancer that gets inside people

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the cancer of stress for not achieving enough,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
the cancer of buried trauma,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
In his new and visionary book,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
"New Self, New World,"

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
the writer Philip Shepherd says,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
"If you are divided from your body,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
you are also divided from the body of the world,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
which then appears to be other than you

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or separate from you,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
rather than the living continuum

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
to which you belong."

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Before cancer,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
the world was something other.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and cancer dynamited the boulder

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that was separating me from the larger sea.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Now I am swimming in it.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Now I lay down in the grass

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and I rub my body in it,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and I love the mud on my legs and feet.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Now I make a daily pilgrimage

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and I hunger for the green fields

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
in the bush outside Bukavu.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And when it rains hard rain,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I scream and I run in circles.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
I know that everything is connected,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and the scar that runs the length of my torso

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
is the markings of the earthquake.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And the fire that burned in me

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
on day three through six of chemo

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
is the fire that is burning

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
in the forests of the world.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
I know that the abscess

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
that grew around my wound after the operation,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
the 16 ounces of puss,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and dead floating fish.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
made me scream out

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
the way the Earth cries out from the drilling.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
In my second chemo,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
my mother got very sick

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and I went to see her.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And in the name of connectedness,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
the only thing she wanted before she died

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
was to be brought home

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
So we brought her home,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
before she died.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And gratefully, it didn't.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And she died quietly in her favorite place.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and this beautiful, spiritual friend

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
told me she wanted to do a healing for me.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And I was honored.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And I went to her house, and it was morning,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
And my friend was preparing this big bowl,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and I said, "What is it?"

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And she said, "It's for you.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
The flowers make it beautiful,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and the honey makes it sweet."

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And I said, "But what's the water part?"

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And in the name of connectedness,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And I said, "Of course it is."

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And the other women sang

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and they prayed for me and my mother.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
I realized that it held

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
the best and the worst of us.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
It was the greed and recklessness

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that led to the drilling explosion.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
It was all the lies that got told

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
before and after.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
it was the oil that made it sick.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
It was my head that was bald --

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and comfortable now without a hat.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
It was my whole self

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
melting into Michaela's lap.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
that were falling down my cheek.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.260
It was finally being in my body.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
It was the sorrow

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
that's taken so long.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
It was finding my place

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and the huge responsibility

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
that comes with connection.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and the indifference of the world.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
It was the Congolese women

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
who are now rising up.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
It was my mother leaving,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
just at the moment

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
that I was being born.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It was the realization

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
that I had come very close to dying --

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
in the same way that the Earth, our mother,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
is barely holding on,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.260
in the same way that 75 percent of the planet

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
are hardly scraping by,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
in the same way

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
that there is a recipe for survival.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
What I learned

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
is it has to do with attention and resources

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
that everybody deserves.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
It was advocating friends

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and a doting sister.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
It was wise doctors and advanced medicine

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It was underpaid and really loving nurses.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
It was people who came with spells and rituals.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
It was having a vision of the future

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and something to fight for,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
because I know this struggle isn't my own.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
It was a million prayers.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
It was a thousand hallelujahs

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and a million oms.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
It was a lot of anger,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
insane humor,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
a lot of attention, outrage.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
It was energy, love and joy.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It was all these things.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
It was all these things.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
It was all these things

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
in the water, in the world, in my body.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:52.260
(Applause)
