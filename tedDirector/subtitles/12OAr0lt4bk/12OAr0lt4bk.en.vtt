00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
the dramatic moments of the birth

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of our first son, Declan.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Obviously a really profound moment,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and it changed our lives in many ways.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and a year later, we launched Babble,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
a website for parents.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
AV: We did.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It was a website called Nerve.com,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the tagline of which was "literate smut."

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
a smart online magazine

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
about sex and culture.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
AV: That spawned a dating site.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
which we did.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
was not just the life stage thing,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
which is, of course, relevant,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
but it was really more about

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
our desire to speak very honestly

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
It seems to us that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
when people start dissembling, people start lying about things,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that's when it gets really interesting.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
That's a subject that we want to dive into.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
that there are almost more taboos around parenting

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
than there are around sex.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
AV: It's true. So like we said,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
the early years were really wonderful,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
but they were also really difficult.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And we feel like some of that difficulty

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
was because of this false advertisement around parenting.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
(Laughter)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And we went into parenting

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
expecting our lives to look like this.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and in fact, it was not like that at all.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
that we were looking at, with these beautiful images,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and looked at the scene in our actual living room,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
it looked a little bit more like this.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
These are our three sons.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
but with three boys, there's a decent probability

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that at least one of them will not be comporting himself

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
exactly as he should.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
We really felt like what we went in expecting

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
We really wanted to let them understand

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
RG: So today, what we would love to do

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
is share with you four parenting taboos.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And of course, there are many more than four things

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
you can't say about parenting,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
but we would like to share with you today

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
four that are particularly relevant for us personally.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So the first, taboo number one:

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
in the very first minute.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
AV: We, or I?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
RG: I'm sorry.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Misuse of the pronoun.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Alisa was very generously in the process

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And I was there with my arms open.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
The nurse was coming at me

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
with this beautiful, beautiful child,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and I remember, as she was approaching me,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
the voices of friends saying,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
"The moment they put the baby in your hands,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
you will feel a sense of love that will come over you

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So I was bracing myself for the moment.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
The baby was coming,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and I was ready for this Mack truck of love

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to just knock me off my feet.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
it was an extraordinary moment.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
This picture is from literally a few seconds after

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And you can see, our eyes were glistening.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
with deep, deep gratitude

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that we had what appeared to be a healthy child.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And it was also, of course, surreal.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And this was all quite remarkable.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And so we've done something here

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that is heretical.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
We have charted

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
our love for our child over time.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This, as you know, is an act of heresy.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
You're not allowed to chart love.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
The reason you're not allowed to chart love

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
is because we think of love as a binary thing.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
You're either in love, or you're not in love.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
You love, or you don't love.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And I think the reality is that love is a process,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and I think the problem with thinking of love

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
as something that's binary

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
is that it causes us

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
to be unduly concerned

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
in the early months, maybe their first year,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
because you can notice where he dips in the first years

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
where I think I was doing most of the work.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
But we like to joke,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in the first few months of all of our children's lives,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
this is Uncle Rufus.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
(Laughter)

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
amongst other babies.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
RG: Uh oh.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
RG: The far left. AV: No!

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.260
(Laughter)

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
RG: Cruel.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
AV: Nothing more to be said.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
(Laughter)

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
I'll move on to taboo number two.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
tracking it down till the actual due-date.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
It was a really wonderful experience,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
but when I got home,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I suddenly felt very disconnected

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
and suddenly shut in and shut out,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and I was really surprised by those feelings.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I did expect it to be difficult,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
have sleepless nights, constant feedings,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
but I did not expect the feelings

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
of isolation and loneliness that I experienced,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
that I was going to be feeling this way.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And I called my sister

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
whom I'm very close to -- and had three children --

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I was going to be feeling this way,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And she said -- I'll never forget --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
"It's just not something you want to say to a mother

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
that's having a baby for the first time."

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
RG: And of course, we think

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
it's precisely what you really should be saying

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
to mothers who have kids for the first time.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
is that we think

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
that candor and brutal honesty

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
is critical to us collectively

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
being great parents.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And it's hard not to think

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
that part of what leads to this sense of isolation

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
is our modern world.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
So Alisa's experience is not isolated.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
report feelings of loneliness.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
In the process of preparing this,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
we looked at how some other cultures around the world

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
deal with this period of time,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
because here in the Western world,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
So to take one example among many:

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
in Southern India

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
there's a practice known as jholabhari,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
moves in with her mother

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
give birth and returns home to her nuclear family

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
several months after the child is born.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And this is one of many ways

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
AV: So taboo number three:

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So after we had Declan,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
we kind of recalibrated our expectations.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
We thought we actually could go through this again

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and thought we knew what we would be up against.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and I soon learned that we were having a boy,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and then when I was five months,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
we learned that we had lost our child.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
This is actually the last little image we have of him.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And it was obviously a very difficult time --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
really painful.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
As I was working through that mourning process,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
I really wanted to crawl into a hole,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and I didn't really know how I was going

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
to work my way back into my surrounding community.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
is on a really deep gut level,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
I was feeling a lot of shame

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and embarrassed, frankly,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
that, in some respects, I had failed

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And of course, it made me question,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
if I wasn't able to have another child,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
what would that mean for my marriage,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and just me as a woman.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So it was a very difficult time.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
As I started working through it more,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
I was really amazed

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
by all the stories that started flooding in.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
People I interacted with daily,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
worked with, was friends with,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
family members that I had known a long time,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
had never shared with me their own stories.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and I felt like I happened upon

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
this secret society of women that I now was a part of,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
which was reassuring and also really concerning.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And I think,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
miscarriage is an invisible loss.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
There's not really a lot of community support around it.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
There's really no ceremony,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
rituals, or rites.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and there's a lot of community support,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
RG: Which is too bad because, of course,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
it's a very common and very traumatic experience.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and I find this astounding.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
In a survey, 74 percent of women said

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
And astoundingly, 22 percent

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
So taboo number four:

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
you can't say that your average happiness

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
has declined since having a child.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
The party line is that every single aspect of my life

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
has just gotten dramatically better

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
ever since I participated

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
in the miracle that is childbirth and family.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
our first son, Declan, was nine months old,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and I was sitting there on the couch,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And I got about two-thirds of the way through,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and there was a chart on the right-hand side --

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
on the right-hand page --

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
that we've labeled here

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
for a New Parent."

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Basically, there's this precipitous drop

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
of marital satisfaction,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that doesn't rise again

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
until your first child goes to college.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
this chasm of happiness

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
We were despondent.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
but we'd come out of it,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and were really shocked to see this study.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
in hopes that we would find a silver lining.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
because we got this incredible reporter

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
to go and interview all the scientists

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
who conducted these four studies.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
We said, something is wrong here.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
There's something missing from these studies.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
It can't possibly be that bad.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and she interviewed four scientists,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and we did indeed find a silver lining.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
So this is our guess

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
as to what this baseline of average happiness

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
arguably looks like throughout life.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
because it doesn't speak

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
to the moment-by-moment experience,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
and so this is what we think it looks like

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
when you layer in

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
moment-to-moment experience.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
And so we all remember as children,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
the teeniest little thing

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
can just rocket them to these heights

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
of just utter adulation,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and then the next teeniest little thing

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And then, of course, as you get older,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
it's almost like age is a form of lithium.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
As you get older, you become more stable.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
You start to realize that

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
"Hey, I could go to this live music event

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
and have an utterly transforming experience

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
that will cover my entire body with goosebumps,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and I won't be able to get a beer.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
So I'm not going to go.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
So your average happiness goes up,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
but you lose those transcendent moments.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and then you really resubmit yourself

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
to these highs and lows --

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
the highs being the first steps, the first smile,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
your child reading to you for the first time --

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
But you realize you resubmit yourself

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
to losing control in a really wonderful way,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and is quite gratifying.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
RG: And so in effect,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
we trade average happiness.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
We trade the sort of security and safety

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
of a certain level of contentment

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
for these transcendent moments.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
So where does that leave the two of us

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
as a family with our three little boys

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
in the thick of all this?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
There's another factor in our case.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
We have violated yet another taboo

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
in our own lives,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
and this is a bonus taboo.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
especially with three children --

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
and we are.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
the venture capitalists said,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
"We categorically don't invest

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
in companies founded by husbands and wives,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
because there's an extra point of failure.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
It's a bad idea. Don't do it."

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
And we obviously went forward. We did.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
because in this phase of one's life,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
the incredibly scarce resource is time.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
and you're also passionate about your relationship,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
this is the only way we know how to do it.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
And so the final question that we would ask is:

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
but they're sometimes pretty quick.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
And so how about that average baseline of happiness?

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Can we move that up a little bit?

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
is really the result of walking into parenting --

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
and really any long-term partnership for that matter --

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
with the wrong expectations.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
RG: And so this is what --

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
And we think that a lot of parents,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
when you get in there -- in our case anyway --

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
Get out of the airplane,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
particularly if you pack your bags properly

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
So the point of all this for us today

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
that we can all collectively

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
RG + AV: Thank you.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.260
(Applause)
