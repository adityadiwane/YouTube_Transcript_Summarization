00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Your iPhone, your laptop,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And we should save trees in the end.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
So it's enough to bury any industry.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Some people say it should be free;

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
it should be local, run by communities,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
or niche, for some smaller groups like business --

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
but then it's not free; it's very expensive.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
It should be opinion-driven;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
less news, more views.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
And we'd rather read it during breakfast,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
because later we listen to radio in a car,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
Because in the long run,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I think there is no reason, no practical reason

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
for newspapers to survive.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
So what can we do?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160
(Laughter)

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Let me tell you my story.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
They were run by an inexperienced staff,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160
with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals --

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
in many places there were not even art directors.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
"What are you doing for a living?"

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
I said, "I'm designing newspapers."

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
(Laughter)

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And I had a revelation. I thought,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
"These guys took some creepy,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
run-down entertainment,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and put it to the highest possible level of performance art."

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
The front page became our signature.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
My approach was very egotistic.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
I wanted my artistic statement,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
my interpretation of reality.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
Not even magazines: posters.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
We were experimenting with type,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
with illustration, with photos. And we had fun.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Soon it started to bring results.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
In Poland, our pages were named

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
Other examples you can see here are from

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia --

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160
the central European countries.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
But it's not only about the front page.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
The secret is that we were treating

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
the whole newspaper as one piece,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.160
as one composition -- like music.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And design is responsible for this experience.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Flipping through pages is readers experience,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
and I'm responsible for this experience.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
because that's how readers perceive it.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
on biggest infographic competition in Spain.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And two years later,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
the same award came to Estonia.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Isn't amazing?

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
were growing too.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Just some examples:

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
in Russia, plus 11 after one year,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
plus 29 after three years of the redesign.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
raise of circulation after three years.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
You can see on a graph,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
just after redesign.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
But the real hit was in Bulgaria.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
And that is really amazing.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Did design do this?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Design was just a part of the process.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And the process we made was not about changing the look,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.160
it was about improving the product completely.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
I took an architectural rule about function and form

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
and translated it into newspaper content and design.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And I put strategy at the top of it.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
Then we adjust the content accordingly.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
And then, usually after two months, we start designing.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Why am I asking all of these business questions,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
instead of just showing them pages?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
So what is the lesson behind it?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.160
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company;

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
it can turn your company upside down.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
It can even change you.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And who's responsible? Designers.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Give power to designers.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.160
(Applause)

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
But the second is even more important.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
You can live in a small poor country, like me.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
You can work for a small company,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
in a boring branch.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
You can have no budgets, no people --

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
but still can put your work to the highest possible level.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
And everybody can do it.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
You just need inspiration, vision and determination.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And you need to remember that to be good

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
is not enough.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Thank you.
