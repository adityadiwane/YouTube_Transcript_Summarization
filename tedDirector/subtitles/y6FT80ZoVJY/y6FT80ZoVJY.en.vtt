00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Back in 1992, I started working for a company

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
called Interval Research,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
which was just then being founded

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
by David Lidell and Paul Allen

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
I met with David

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
to talk about what I might do in his company.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
and writing books --

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
after twenty years or so in the computer game industry

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
And David and I discovered

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
that we had a question in common,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
that we really wanted the answer to,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
and that was,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Why is that?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
These people aren't that smart.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
There's six billion dollars on the table.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
They would go for it if they could figure out how.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
So, what is the deal here?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
And as we thought about our goals --

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
in the classical sense

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
that humanism, at its best,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
with a set of core values

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
that fundamentally love and respect people.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
The basic idea of humanism

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
is the improvable quality of life;

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
that we can do good things,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
that there are things worth doing

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
because they're good things to do,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and that clear-eyed empiricism

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
can help us figure out how to do them.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
So, contrary to popular belief,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And Interval Research is kind of the living example

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
of how that can be true.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
So David and I decided to go find out,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
through the best research we could muster,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
what it would take to get a little girl

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
to put her hands on a computer,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
that little boys have because they play video games.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
We spent two and a half years conducting research;

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
we spent another year and a half in advance development.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Then we formed a spin-off company.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
In the research phase of the project at Interval,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.160
and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland --

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
changed my mind entirely about what market research was

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
and what it could be.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
They taught me how to look and see,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
of saying to a child,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
"Of all these things we already make you,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
which do you like best?" --

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
which gives you zero answers that are usable.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
So, what we did for the first two and a half years

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
was four things:

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
We did an extensive review of the literature

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
in related fields, like cognitive psychology,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
spatial cognition, gender studies,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
play theory, sociology, primatology.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
and discovered what we thought the salient issues were

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
with girls and boys and playing --

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
because, after all, that's really what this is about --

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
we moved to the second phase of our work,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
where we interviewed adult experts

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
in academia, some of the people

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
like playground supervisors. We talked to them,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
about gender difference and play.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
ages seven to 12, all over the United States --

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
and they wouldn't be a representative sample.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And at the end of those remarkable conversations

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
with kids and their best friends across the United States,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.160
drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
for designing computer-based products --

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160
and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
and testing them with little girls.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
which was a spinoff of Interval Research,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
We launched a website on September 2nd

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
that has now served 25 million pages,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and has 42,000 registered young girl users.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
They visit an average of one and a half times a day,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
spend an average of 35 minutes a visit,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
and look at 50 pages a visit.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
We launched two titles in October --

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
"Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.160
which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Who are my friends?";

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
to exercise the love of social complexity

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.160
and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data --

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
entertainment titles in PC Data

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
in December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
which thrills me to death.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
So, we're real,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
We've made half-a-billion impressions

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.160
with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
four percent of them have been "other."

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
I want to talk about the other,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
because the politics of this enterprise, in a way,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.160
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.160
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
who thinks he knows what games ought to be,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
and won't show the product to little girls.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.160
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.160
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
have one thing in common:

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
they don't listen to little girls.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
They haven't looked at children

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did --

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
actually, some of the voices are more recent.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
that they took for us of their lives,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
of the things that they value and care about.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.160
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and this is the kind of research I recommend to those

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
who want to do humanistic work.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
Hers is more into boys.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age --

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.160
are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:12.160
boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
with clouds and flowers.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160
you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:51.160
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
like when I get Mondays and all those days off.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team --

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
all this different stuff that I have to do,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and sometimes it gets overwhelming.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Girl 9: My friend Justine

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.160
and they take your idea and they do it themselves.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
But she gives my sister everything.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Let's hope it's really stable.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
This is the second day in Rockett's life.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
The reason I'm showing you this

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.160
is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.160
And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
in the game that we've created.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
Nakilia invited Reuben too, but --

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Miko: I don't think so.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
Rockett: Really? What other party?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
He's invited all the best people.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
because I know I don't have a lot of time.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.160
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
we can go into this hidden hallway,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
and I'll quickly just show you the interface.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.160
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and get some more information about her.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
Oops, I turned the wrong way.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
But you get the general idea of the product.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls --

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160
and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.160
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
is a kind of validation,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
a sense of being seen.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
We love them.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
We see them.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
But we're really, really happy about who they are.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
It turns out they're really great.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160
I want to close by showing you a videotape

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
that our graphic artists and design people put together,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.160
that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
"Rockett 28!"

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
BL: Thanks.
