00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
This means, "I'm smiling."

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
So does that.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
This means "mouse."

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
"Cat."

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
Here we have a story.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
The start of the story, where this means guy,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.330
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
Here's where it happens.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
These are when.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
She wears it every day.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.330
It's not considered vintage --

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
That's because she dances.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
(Laughter)

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
or "I heart you!"

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
"I'm laughing out loud."

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
"I want to give you a hug."

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
But he comes up with that, you know.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
(Laughter)

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
Put a crab inside it.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Add some water.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Seven different salts.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
but just panhandle at the ocean.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.330
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
At least, that's how it seems.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
I'm a monkey --

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.330
(Laughter) --

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
blowing kisses

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
at a butterfly.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
First, soon, and then a lot.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
Hell, ponytail alone.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I don't know what else to tell you.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
I got a pencil you can borrow.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
You can put it in your phone."

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.330
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
She just says, "No thank you."

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
You know?

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.330
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.330
(Applause)
