00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
How many of you had to fill out a web form

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.796
where you've been asked to read

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.956
a distorted sequence
of characters like this?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.933
How many of you found it really annoying?

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.056
(Laughter)

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.816
OK, outstanding. So I invented that.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.676
(Laughter)

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.556
Or I was one of the people who did it.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.116
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.276
And it is there to make sure
you, the entity filling out the form,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.156
are a human and not a computer program

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.756
that was written to submit
the form millions of times.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.436
The reason it works is because humans,
at least non-visually-impaired humans,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.876
have no trouble reading
these distorted characters,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.876
whereas programs can't do it as well yet.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.396
In the case of Ticketmaster,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.516
the reason you have
to type these characters

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.676
is to prevent scalpers
from writing a program

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.956
that can buy millions
of tickets, two at a time.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.916
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.516
And since they're used so often,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.676
a lot of times the sequence
of random characters shown to the user

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.916
is not so fortunate.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.596
So this is an example
from the Yahoo registration page.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.436
The random characters
that happened to be shown to the user

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.156
were W, A, I, T,
which, of course, spell a word.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.276
But the best part is the message

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.756
that the Yahoo help desk
got about 20 minutes later.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.916
[Help! I've been waiting
for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.796
(Laughter)

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.725
This person thought they needed to wait.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.156
This, of course,
is not as bad as this poor person.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.556
(Laughter)

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.316
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did
at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.796
and it's been used everywhere.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.956
Let me now tell you about a project
that we did a few years later,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.196
which is sort of
the next evolution of CAPTCHA.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.196
This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.996
which is something that we started
here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.028
then we turned it into a start-up company.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:51.640
And then about a year and a half ago,
Google actually acquired this company.

00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:53.671
Let me tell you what this project started.

00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:56.226
This project started
from the following realization:

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.687
It turns out that approximately
200 million CAPTCHAs

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.862
are typed everyday
by people around the world.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.370
When I first heard this,
I was quite proud of myself.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.735
I thought, look at the impact
my research has had.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.243
But then I started feeling bad.

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.473
Here's the thing:
each time you type a CAPTCHA,

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.836
essentially, you waste
10 seconds of your time.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.796
And if you multiply that by 200 million,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.836
you get that humanity is wasting
about 500,000 hours every day

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.396
typing these annoying CAPTCHAs.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.436
(Laughter)

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.889
So then I started feeling bad.

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:22.716
(Laughter)

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.236
And then I started thinking, of course,
we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.516
because the security of the web
depends on them.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.956
But then I started thinking,
can we use this effort

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.916
for something that is good for humanity?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.436
So see, here's the thing.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.076
While you're typing a CAPTCHA,
during those 10 seconds,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.956
your brain is doing something amazing.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.796
Your brain is doing something
that computers cannot yet do.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.516
So can we get you to do useful work
for those 10 seconds?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.036
Is there some humongous problem
that we cannot yet get computers to solve,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.836
yet we can split
into tiny 10-second chunks

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.036
such that each time
somebody solves a CAPTCHA,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.996
they solve a little bit of this problem?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.156
And the answer to that is "yes,"
and this is what we're doing now.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.116
Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.569
not only are you authenticating
yourself as a human,

00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:05.036
but in addition you're helping us
to digitize books.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.516
Let me explain how this works.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.956
There's a lot of projects
trying to digitize books.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.116
Google has one.
The Internet Archive has one.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.636
Amazon, with the Kindle,
is trying to digitize books.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.836
Basically, the way this works
is you start with an old book.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.436
You've seen those things, right?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.676
Like a book?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.956
(Laughter)

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.516
So you start with a book
and then you scan it.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.756
Now, scanning a book

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.156
is like taking a digital
photograph of every page.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.996
It gives you an image for every page.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.596
This is an image with text
for every page of the book.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.756
The next step in the process
is that the computer needs to be able

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.516
to decipher the words in this image.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.956
That's using a technology called OCR,
for optical character recognition,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.396
which takes a picture of text

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.596
and tries to figure out
what text is in there.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.276
Now, the problem
is that OCR is not perfect.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.716
Especially for older books

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.876
where the ink has faded
and the pages have turned yellow,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.836
OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.316
For things that were written
more than 50 years ago,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.196
the computer cannot recognize
about 30 percent of the words.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.596
So now we're taking all of the words
that the computer cannot recognize

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.876
and we're getting people
to read them for us

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.116
while they're typing
a CAPTCHA on the Internet.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.316
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA,
these words that you're typing

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.916
are actually words from books
that are being digitized

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.796
that the computer could not recognize.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.276
The reason we have
two words nowadays instead of one

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.716
is because one of the words

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.316
is a word that the system
just got out of a book,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.356
it didn't know what it was
and it's going to present it to you.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.076
But since it doesn't know the answer,
it cannot grade it.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.476
So we give you another word,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.500
for which the system does know the answer.

00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:32.596
We don't tell you which one's which
and we say, please type both.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.195
And if you type the correct word

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.596
for the one for which
the system knows the answer,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.876
it assumes you are human

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.356
and it also gets some confidence
that you typed the other word correctly.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.836
And if we repeat this process
to 10 different people

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.756
and they agree on what the new word is,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.996
then we get one more word
digitized accurately.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.596
So this is how the system works.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.236
And since we released it
about three or four years ago,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.196
a lot of websites have started
switching from the old CAPTCHA,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.756
where people wasted their time,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.716
to the new CAPTCHA where people
are helping to digitize books.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.916
So every time you buy
tickets on Ticketmaster,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.316
you help to digitize a book.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.956
Facebook: Every time
you add a friend or poke somebody,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.356
you help to digitize a book.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.316
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites
are all using reCAPTCHA.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.156
And the number of sites
that are using reCAPTCHA is so high

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.316
that the number of words
we're digitizing per day is really large.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.756
It's about 100 million a day,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.276
which is the equivalent of about
two and a half million books a year.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.436
And this is all being done
one word at a time

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.676
by just people typing
CAPTCHAs on the Internet.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.580
(Applause)

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.156
Now, of course,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.516
since we're doing so many words per day,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.796
funny things can happen.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.436
This is especially true
because now we're giving people

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.956
two randomly chosen English words
next to each other.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.316
So funny things can happen.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.076
For example, we presented this word.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.836
It's the word "Christians";
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.796
But if you present it along
with another randomly chosen word,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.156
bad things can happen.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.396
So we get this.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.636
[bad Christians]

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.556
But it's even worse, because
the website where we showed this

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.636
actually happened to be called
The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.356
(Laughter)

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.596
Oops.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.476
(Laughter)

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.196
Here's another really bad one.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.516
JohnEdwards.com

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.756
[Damn liberal]

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.276
(Laughter)

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.116
So we keep on insulting people
left and right everyday.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.156
Of course, we're not
just insulting people.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.356
Here's the thing. Since we're presenting
two randomly chosen words,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.836
interesting things can happen.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.476
So this actually has given rise
to a really big Internet meme

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.036
that tens of thousands of people
have participated in,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.716
which is called CAPTCHA art.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.716
I'm sure some of you have heard about it.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.996
Here's how it works.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.636
Imagine you're using the Internet
and you see a CAPTCHA

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.396
that you think is somewhat peculiar,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.636
like this CAPTCHA.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.876
[invisible toaster]

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.636
What you're supposed to do
is you take a screenshot of it.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.316
Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA
because you help us digitize a book.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.836
But first you take a screenshot

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.236
and then you draw something
that is related to it.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.956
(Laughter)

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.196
That's how it works.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.556
(Laughter)

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.236
There are tens of thousands of these.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.332
Some of them are very cute.

00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:07.569
[clenched it]

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.436
(Laughter)

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.996
Some of them are funnier.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.236
[stoned Founders]

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.636
(Laughter)

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.089
And some of them,
like paleontological shvisle ...

00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:22.036
(Laughter)

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.276
they contain Snoop Dogg.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.436
(Laughter)

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.036
OK, so this is my favorite
number of reCAPTCHA.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.236
So this is the favorite thing
that I like about this whole project.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.076
This is the number of distinct people

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.836
that have helped us digitize at least
one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.916
750 million, a little over 10 percent
of the world's population,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.836
has helped us digitize human knowledge.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.956
And it is numbers like these
that motivate my research agenda.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.036
So the question that motivates
my research is the following:

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.476
If you look at humanity's
large-scale achievements,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.716
these really big things

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.455
that humanity has gotten together
and done historically --

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.956
like, for example,
building the pyramids of Egypt

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.556
or the Panama Canal

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.636
or putting a man on the Moon --

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.356
there is a curious fact about them,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.716
and it is that they were all done
with about the same number of people.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.436
It's weird; they were all done
with about 100,000 people.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.116
And the reason for that is because,
before the Internet,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.996
coordinating more than 100,000 people,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.036
let alone paying them,
was essentially impossible.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.716
But now with the Internet,
I've just shown you a project

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.236
where we've gotten 750 million people
to help us digitize human knowledge.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.436
So the question
that motivates my research is,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.596
if we can put a man
on the Moon with 100,000,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.796
what can we do with 100 million?

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.076
So based on this question,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.156
we've had a lot of different projects
that we've been working on.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.716
Let me tell you about one
that I'm most excited about.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.396
This is something that we've been
semiquietly working on

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.116
for the last year and a half or so.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.516
It hasn't yet been launched.
It's called Duolingo.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.276
Since it hasn't been launched, shhh!

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.956
(Laughter)

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.236
Yeah, I can trust you'll do that.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.476
So this is the project.
Here's how it started.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.076
It started with me posing a question
to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.380
OK, that's Severin Hacker.

00:08:57.299 --> 00:08:59.516
So I posed the question
to my graduate student.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.516
By the way, you did hear me correctly;
his last name is Hacker.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.556
(Laughter)

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.876
So I posed this question to him:
How can we get 100 million people

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.860
translating the web
into every major language for free?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.916
There's a lot of things
to say about this question.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.596
First of all, translating the web.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.416
Right now, the web
is partitioned into multiple languages.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.256
A large fraction of it is in English.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.496
If you don't know English,
you can't access it.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.216
But there's large fractions
in other different languages,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.496
and if you don't know them,
you can't access it.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.616
So I would like to translate
all of the web,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.016
or at least most of it,
into every major language.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.536
That's what I would like to do.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.036
Now, some of you may say,
why can't we use computers to translate?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.156
Machine translation
is starting to translate

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.636
some sentences here and there.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.636
Why can't we use it to translate the web?

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.996
The problem with that
is it's not yet good enough

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.516
and it probably won't be
for the next 15 to 20 years.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.876
It makes a lot of mistakes.
Even when it doesn't,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.476
since it makes so many mistakes,
you don't know whether to trust it or not.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.916
So let me show you an example

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.196
of something that was
translated with a machine.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.676
Actually, it was a forum post.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.876
It was somebody who was trying
to ask a question about JavaScript.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.516
It was translated
from Japanese into English.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.316
So I'll just let you read.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.116
This person starts apologizing

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.596
for the fact that
it's translated with a computer.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.396
So the next sentence is going to be
the preamble to the question.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.076
So he's just explaining something.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.156
Remember, it's a question
about JavaScript.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.796
[At often, the goat-time
install a error is vomit.]

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.916
(Laughter)

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.476
Then comes the first part of the question.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.436
[How many times like the wind,
a pole, and the dragon?]

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.116
(Laughter)

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.196
Then comes my favorite part
of the question.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.156
[This insult to father's stones?]

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.036
(Laughter)

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.356
And then comes the ending,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.516
which is my favorite part
of the whole thing.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.676
[Please apologize for your stupidity.
There are a many thank you.]

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.876
(Laughter)

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.836
OK, so computer translation,
not yet good enough.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.116
So back to the question.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.116
So we need people
to translate the whole web.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.116
So now the next question you may have is,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.316
well, why can't we just
pay people to do this?

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.436
We could pay professional translators
to translate the whole web.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.716
We could do that.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.956
Unfortunately, it would be
extremely expensive.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.236
For example, translating a tiny fraction
of the whole web, Wikipedia,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.756
into one other language, Spanish.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.756
OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.236
but it's very small
compared to the size of English.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.436
It's about 20 percent
of the size of English.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.316
If we wanted to translate
the other 80 percent into Spanish,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.476
it would cost at least
50 million dollars --

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.156
and this is even at the most exploited,
outsourcing country out there.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.636
So it would be very expensive.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.422
So what we want to do is,
we want to get 100 million people

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.036
translating the web
into every major language for free.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.476
If this is what you want to do,
you quickly realize

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.436
you're going to run
into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.756
The first one is a lack of bilinguals.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.956
So I don't even know

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.716
if there exists 100 million people
out there using the web

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.036
who are bilingual enough
to help us translate.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.276
That's a big problem.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.476
The other problem you're going to run into
is a lack of motivation.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.036
How are we going to motivate people
to actually translate the web for free?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.356
Normally, you have to pay
people to do this.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.996
So how are we going to motivate them
to do it for free?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.756
When we were starting to think about this,
we were blocked by these two things.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.476
But then we realized, there's a way

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.956
to solve both these problems
with the same solution.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.596
To kill two birds with one stone.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.756
And that is to transform
language translation

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.596
into something that millions
of people want to do

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.756
and that also helps
with the problem of lack of bilinguals,

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.156
and that is language education.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.156
So it turns out that today,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.580
there are over 1.2 billion people
learning a foreign language.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.516
People really want
to learn a foreign language.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.676
And it's not just because
they're being forced to do so in school.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.116
In the US alone,
there are over five million people

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.036
who have paid over $500
for software to learn a new language.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.236
So people really want
to learn a new language.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.996
So what we've been working on
for the last year and a half

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.076
is a new website --
it's called Duolingo --

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.956
where the basic idea is
people learn a new language for free

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.036
while simultaneously translating the web.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.596
And so basically,
they're learning by doing.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.836
So the way this works

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.276
is whenever you're a just a beginner,
we give you very simple sentences.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.676
There's a lot of very simple
sentences on the web.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.916
We give you very simple sentences
along with what each word means.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.276
And as you translate them

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.516
and as you see how other people
translate them,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.116
you start learning the language.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.556
And as you get more advanced,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.836
we give you more complex
sentences to translate.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.876
But at all times,
you're learning by doing.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.596
Now, the crazy thing about this method
is that it actually really works.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.476
People are really learning a language.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.116
We're mostly done building it
and now we're testing it.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.196
People really can
learn a language with it.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.716
And they learn it about as well
as the leading language learning software.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.556
So people really do learn a language.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.076
And not only do they learn it as well,
but actually it's more interesting.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.996
Because with Duolingo,
people are learning with real content.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.196
As opposed to learning
with made-up sentences,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.556
people are learning with real content,
which is inherently interesting.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.396
So people really do learn a language.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.036
But perhaps more surprisingly,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.796
the translations that we get
from people using the site,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.596
even though they're just beginners,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.996
the translations that we get

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.956
are as accurate as those
of professional language translators,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.196
which is very surprising.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.756
So let me show you one example.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.796
This is a sentence that was translated
from German into English.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.596
The top is the German.
The middle is an English translation

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.876
that was done by a professional translator

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.276
who we paid 20 cents a word
for this translation.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.996
And the bottom is a translation
by users of Duolingo,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.756
none of whom knew any German
before they started using the site.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.756
If you can see, it's pretty much perfect.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.316
Of course, we play a trick here

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.676
to make the translations as good
as professional language translators.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.036
We combine the translations
of multiple beginners

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.956
to get the quality
of a single professional translator.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.516
Now, even though
we're combining the translations,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.316
the site actually
can translate pretty fast.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.556
So let me show you,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.516
this is our estimates
of how fast we could translate Wikipedia

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.836
from English into Spanish.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.836
Remember, this is
50 million dollars' worth of value.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.316
So if we wanted to translate
Wikipedia into Spanish,

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.036
we could do it in five weeks
with 100,000 active users.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.116
And we could do it in about 80 hours
with a million active users.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.596
Since all the projects
my group has worked on so far

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.076
have gotten millions of users,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.996
we're hopeful that we'll be able
to translate extremely fast.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.996
Now, the thing that
I'm most excited about with Duolingo

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.756
is I think this provides a fair
business model for language education.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.996
So here's the thing:

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.356
The current business model
for language education

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.756
is the student pays,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.836
and in particular, the student
pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.676
(Laughter)

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.356
That's the current business model.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.116
The problem with this business model

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.436
is that 95 percent of the world's
population doesn't have 500 dollars.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.236
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.196
This is totally biased towards the rich.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.836
Now, see, in Duolingo,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.516
because while you learn,
you're actually creating value,

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.876
you're translating stuff --

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.836
which, for example, we could
charge somebody for translations,

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.716
so this is how we could monetize this.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.356
Since people are creating value
while they're learning,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.476
they don't have to pay with their money,
they pay with their time.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.423
But the magical thing here

00:15:52.447 --> 00:15:55.443
is that is time that would have had
to have been spent anyways

00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:56.676
learning the language.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.276
So the nice thing about Duolingo

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.636
is, I think, it provides
a fair business model --

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.036
one that doesn't discriminate
against poor people.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.516
So here's the site. Thank you.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:11.540
(Applause)

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.476
We haven't yet launched,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.796
but if you go there, you can sign up
to be part of our private beta,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.476
which is probably going to start
in three or four weeks.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.836
We haven't yet launched it.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.676
By the way, I'm the one talking here,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.076
but Duolingo is the work
of a really awesome team,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.836
some of whom are here. So thank you.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:34.100
(Applause)
