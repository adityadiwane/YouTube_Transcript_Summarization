00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
has been around since before the French Revolution.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
What's changed

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
is we now can look at the evidence,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and see what inequality does.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I'm going to take you through that data

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and then explain why

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
(Laughter)

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I want to start though

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
with a paradox.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
This shows you life expectancy

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
against gross national income --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
how rich countries are on average.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And you see the countries on the right,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
like Norway and the USA,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.260
are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
But if we look within our societies,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
there are extraordinary social gradients in health

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
running right across society.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
This, again, is life expectancy.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
These are small areas of England and Wales --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Even the people just below the top

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
have less good health

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
than the people at the top.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So income means something very important

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
within our societies,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and nothing between them.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
The explanation of that paradox

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
is that, within our societies,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
we're looking at relative income

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
or social position, social status --

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
where we are in relation to each other

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and the size of the gaps between us.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And as soon as you've got that idea,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
you should immediately wonder:

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
what happens if we widen the differences,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
or compress them,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
make the income differences bigger or smaller?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And that's what I'm going to show you.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
I'm not using any hypothetical data.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm taking data from the U.N. --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
it's the same as the World Bank has --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
on the scale of income differences

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
in these rich developed market democracies.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
The measure we've used,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
because it's easy to understand and you can download it,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
is how much richer the top 20 percent

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
than the bottom 20 percent in each country.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And you see in the more equal countries on the left --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden --

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
as the bottom 20 percent.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
But on the more unequal end --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore --

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
the differences are twice as big.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
On that measure, we are twice as unequal

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
as some of the other successful market democracies.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
We collected data on problems with social gradients,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the kind of problems that are more common

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
at the bottom of the social ladder.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
on kids' maths and literacy scores,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
on infant mortality rates, homicide rates,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
levels of trust,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
obesity, mental illness --

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
which in standard diagnostic classification

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
includes drug and alcohol addiction --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and social mobility.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We put them all in one index.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
They're all weighted equally.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And there, you see it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
which I shall use over and over again in the data.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
The more unequal countries

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
are doing worse

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
on all these kinds of social problems.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
But if you look at that same index

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
of health and social problems

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
in relation to GNP per capita,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
gross national income,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
there's nothing there,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
no correlation anymore.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
We were a little bit worried

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that people might think

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and just manufactured this evidence,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
on the UNICEF index of child well-being.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It has 40 different components

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
put together by other people.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
whether they have books at home,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Everything goes into it.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Highly significant relationship.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
But once again,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
if you look at that measure of child well-being,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in relation to national income per person,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
there's no relationship,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
no suggestion of a relationship.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
What all the data I've shown you so far says

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
is the same thing.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
The average well-being of our societies

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
is not dependent any longer

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
on national income and economic growth.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
That's very important in poorer countries,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but not in the rich developed world.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
But the differences between us

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and where we are in relation to each other

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
now matter very much.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Here, for instance, is trust.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
It's simply the proportion of the population

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
who agree most people can be trusted.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It comes from the World Values Survey.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
You see, at the more unequal end,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
it's about 15 percent of the population

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
who feel they can trust others.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
But in the more equal societies,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
it rises to 60 or 65 percent.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
or social capital,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
very similar relationships

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
closely related to inequality.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I may say, we did all this work twice.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
We did it first on these rich, developed countries,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and then as a separate test bed,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
we repeated it all on the 50 American states --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
asking just the same question:

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
do the more unequal states

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
do worse on all these kinds of measures?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
related to inequality.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Very similar scatter

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
over a similar range of levels of trust.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Same thing is going on.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Basically we found

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that almost anything that's related to trust internationally

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
is related to trust amongst the 50 states

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
in that separate test bed.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
We're not just talking about a fluke.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This is mental illness.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
WHO put together figures

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
using the same diagnostic interviews

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
on random samples of the population

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
to allow us to compare rates of mental illness

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
in each society.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
This is the percent of the population

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
with any mental illness in the preceding year.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And it goes from about eight percent

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
up to three times that --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
whole societies

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
with three times the level of mental illness of others.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And again, closely related to inequality.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
This is violence.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
These red dots are American states,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
But look at the scale of the differences.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
It goes from 15 homicides per million

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
up to 150.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
This is the proportion of the population in prison.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
There's a about a tenfold difference there,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
log scale up the side.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But it goes from about 40 to 400

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
people in prison.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
That relationship

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
is not mainly driven by more crime.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
In some places, that's part of it.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
harsher sentencing.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And the more unequal societies

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.260
are more likely also to retain the death penalty.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Here we have children dropping out of high school.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Again, quite big differences.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Extraordinarily damaging,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
if you're talking about using the talents of the population.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
This is social mobility.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It's actually a measure of mobility

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
based on income.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Basically, it's asking:

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
do rich fathers have rich sons

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and poor fathers have poor sons,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
or is there no relationship between the two?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And at the more unequal end,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
fathers' income is much more important --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
in the U.K., USA.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And in Scandinavian countries,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
fathers' income is much less important.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
There's more social mobility.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And as we like to say --

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
if Americans want to live the American dream,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
they should go to Denmark.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Laughter)

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
(Applause)

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
I could have shown a number of other problems.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
They're all problems that tend to be more common

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
at the bottom of the social gradient.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But there are endless problems with social gradients

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that are worse in more unequal countries --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
not just a little bit worse,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Think of the expense,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
the human cost of that.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
where we put it all together

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to make two points.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
One is that, in graph after graph,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
we find the countries that do worse,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
whatever the outcome,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
seem to be the more unequal ones,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and the ones that do well

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So what we're looking at

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
is general social disfunction related to inequality.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
It's not just one or two things that go wrong,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
it's most things.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
The other really important point I want to make on this graph

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
is that, if you look at the bottom,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Sweden and Japan,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The position of women,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
how closely they keep to the nuclear family,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
are on opposite ends of the poles

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
in terms of the rich developed world.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
But another really important difference

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
is how they get their greater equality.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Sweden has huge differences in earnings,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and it narrows the gap through taxation,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
general welfare state,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
generous benefits and so on.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Japan is rather different though.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It has lower taxes.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
It has a smaller welfare state.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And in our analysis of the American states,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
we find rather the same contrast.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
There are some states that do well through redistribution,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
some states that do well

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
because they have smaller income differences before tax.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So we conclude

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
as long as you get there somehow.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I am not talking about perfect equality,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Another really surprising part of this picture

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is that it's not just the poor

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
who are affected by inequality.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
"No man is an island."

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
how people do in more and less equal countries

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
at each level in the social hierarchy.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
This is just one example.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
It's infant mortality.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.260
according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And so it's anachronistically

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
a classification by fathers' occupations,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
so single parents go on their own.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
But then where it says "low social class,"

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that's unskilled manual occupations.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
then the junior non-manual,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
going up high to the professional occupations --

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
doctors, lawyers,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
directors of larger companies.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
all the way across the social hierarchy.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
But even at the top,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
there seems to be a small benefit

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
to being in a more equal society.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
We show that on about five different sets of data

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
covering educational outcomes

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
and health in the United States and internationally.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And that seems to be the general picture --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
but has some benefits even at the top.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
But I should say a few words about what's going on.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
I think I'm looking and talking

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
about the psychosocial effects of inequality.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
of being valued and devalued,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
respected and disrespected.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And of course, those feelings

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
of the status competition that comes out of that

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
drives the consumerism in our society.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
It also leads to status insecurity.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.260
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
whether we're regarded as attractive, clever,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
all that kind of thing.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
The social-evaluative judgments increase,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
Interestingly,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
some parallel work going on in social psychology:

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
some people reviewed 208 different studies

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
in which volunteers had been invited

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
into a psychological laboratory

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and had their stress hormones,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And in the review,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
what they were interested in seeing

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
is what kind of stresses

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
most reliably raise levels of cortisol,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
the central stress hormone.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And the conclusion was

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat --

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
threats to self-esteem or social status

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
in which others can negatively judge your performance.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Those kind of stresses

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
have a very particular effect

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
on the physiology of stress.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Now we have been criticized.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and people who find it very surprising.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I should tell you though

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
we never pick and choose data.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We have an absolute rule

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
it goes into the analysis.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Our data source decides

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
whether it's reliable data,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
we don't.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Otherwise that would introduce bias.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
What about other countries?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
There are 200 studies

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
of health in relation to income and equality

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
in the academic peer-reviewed journals.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
This isn't confined to these countries here,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
hiding a very simple demonstration.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
The same countries,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
the same measure of inequality,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
one problem after another.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Why don't we control for other factors?

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
doesn't make any difference.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.260
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
have controlled for poverty and education

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and so on.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
What about causality?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We spend a good bit of time.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
in some of these outcomes.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
The big change in our understanding

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
of drivers of chronic health

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
in the rich developed world

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.260
is how important chronic stress from social sources

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
is affecting the immune system,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
the cardiovascular system.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Or for instance, the reason why violence

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
becomes more common in more unequal societies

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.260
is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
I should say that to deal with this,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
we've got to deal with the post-tax things

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and the pre-tax things.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
We've got to constrain income,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
the bonus culture incomes at the top.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
in any way we can.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
I think the take-home message though

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.260
is that we can improve the real quality of human life

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
by reducing the differences in incomes between us.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Suddenly we have a handle

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
and that's exciting.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
Thank you.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:48.260
(Applause)
