00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My name is Joshua Walters.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I'm a performer.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:30.260
(Beatboxing)

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
(Laughter)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
(Applause)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
But as far as being a performer,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I'm also diagnosed

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
bipolar.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I reframe that as a positive

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
because the crazier I get onstage,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the more entertaining I become.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
When I was 16 in San Francisco,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I had my breakthrough manic episode

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Maybe you thought that was scary,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that can get you as high

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
as if you think you're Jesus Christ.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
(Laughter)

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I was sent to a place,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
a psych ward,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and in the psych ward,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
everyone is doing their own one-man show.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.260
(Laughter)

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
There's no audience like this

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to justify their rehearsal time.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
They're just practicing.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
One day they'll get here.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Now when I got out,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I was diagnosed

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and I was given medications

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
by a psychiatrist.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
why don't we give you some Zyprexa.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Okay? Mmhmm?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
At least that's what it says on my pen."

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Laughter)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Some of you are in the field, I can see.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I can feel your noise.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The first half of high school

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
was the struggle of the manic episode,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and the second half

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
was the overmedications of these drugs,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
where I was sleeping through high school.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
When I got out

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I had a choice.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I could either deny

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
my mental illness

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.260
or embrace

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
my mental skillness.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
(Bugle sound)

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
There's a movement going on right now

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
to reframe mental illness as a positive --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
at least the hypomanic edge part of it.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Now if you don't know what hypomania is,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
it's like an engine that's out of control,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
have that creative edge,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
if you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
You're driven to do something

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
that everyone has told you is impossible.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And there's a book -- John Gartner.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and all these business minds

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
have this edge to compete.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
A different book was written not too long ago

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
in the mid-90s

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in which it was looked at in a creative sense

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Some of them committed suicide.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So it wasn't all

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
the good side of the illness.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now recently,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
there's been development in this field.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And there was an article written in the New York Times,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
September 2010,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that stated:

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
"Just Manic Enough."

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Just be manic enough

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
that have this kind of spectrum --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
you know what I'm talking about --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
not maybe full bipolar,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
but they're in the bipolar spectrum --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
where on one side,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
maybe you think you're Jesus,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and on the other side

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
maybe they just make you a lot of money.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Your call. Your call.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So maybe, you know,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
there's no such thing

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
as crazy,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and being diagnosed with a mental illness

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
doesn't mean you're crazy.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But maybe it just means

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
you're more sensitive

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
to what most people can't see

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
or feel.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Maybe no one's really crazy.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Everyone is just a little bit mad.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
How much

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
depends on where you fall in the spectrum.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
How much

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
depends on how lucky you are.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Thank you.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
(Applause)
