00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:19.427
Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:21.411
or have read the book by Michael Lewis,

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:24.547
will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:29.235
Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:30.428
They told his parents that

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:32.467
they predicted that he was going to be a star.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:37.419
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.843
want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to
college --

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:42.500
which is what my mother, who actually does
love me,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.364
said that I should do too, and I did --

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.438
well, he didn't do very well. He struggled
mightily.

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:52.971
He got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:57.059
and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.708
Oakland A's.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:02.132
Now for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:03.828
is seen as a success.

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.030
I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.739
going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:16.178
And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our

00:01:16.178 --> 00:01:20.618
healthcare system, our medical system, is
just as bad at predicting

00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:24.810
what happens to people in it -- patients,
others --

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.423
as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.104
And yet, every day

00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:34.065
thousands of people in this country

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:37.991
are diagnosed with preconditions.

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:42.231
We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,

00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:47.567
we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:48.944
that in the green room.

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:53.297
We also refer to subclinical conditions.

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:57.848
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,

00:01:57.848 --> 00:02:01.383
obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.

00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:04.816
One of my favorites is called
subclinical acne.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:08.783
If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:12.912
which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.

00:02:12.912 --> 00:02:19.527
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.

00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:23.183
Maybe that's because you don't actually
have acne.

00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:29.706
I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:31.561
I call them preposterous.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:37.620
In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.025
Season follows the pre-season.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:44.548
But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:49.121
case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:50.939
We have pre-cancerous lesions,

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.432
which often don't turn into cancer.

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:56.288
And yet,

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:00.214
if you take, for example, subclinical
osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:01.867
the precondition,

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.274
otherwise known as osteopenia,

00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:07.944
you would have to treat 270
women for three years

00:03:07.944 --> 00:03:10.144
in order to prevent one broken bone.

00:03:10.144 --> 00:03:11.753
That's an awful lot of women

00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:14.680
when you multiply by the number of women
who were diagnosed

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.569
with this osteopenia.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.625
And so is it any wonder,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.155
given all of the costs and the side effects

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:25.359
of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.032
we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet

00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:32.319
100,000 people a year -- and that's a conservative estimate -- are dying

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.232
not because of the conditions they have,

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:38.519
but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.331
We've medicalized everything

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:42.300
in this country.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.683
Women in the audience, I have
some

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.682
pretty bad news that you already know,

00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:50.339
and that's that every aspect of your
life

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.747
has been medicalized.

00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:54.171
Strike one is when you hit puberty.

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:58.507
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.

00:03:58.507 --> 00:03:59.323
It's a condition;

00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:00.883
it has to be treated. Strike two

00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:02.483
is if you get pregnant.

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.579
That's been medicalized as
well.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.499
You have to have a high-tech experience

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.227
of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:13.834
Strike three is menopause.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:18.171
We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy

00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:21.217
for menopausal symptoms

00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:25.647
for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,

00:04:25.647 --> 00:04:26.655
NIH-funded.

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:27.583
It said,

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:32.168
actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.952
for many of those women.

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:36.200
Just in case,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.832
I don't want to leave the men out --

00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:39.448
I am one, after all --

00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:42.137
I have really bad news for all of you in
this room,

00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:43.097
and for everyone

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:44.843
listening and watching elsewhere:

00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:46.056
You all have

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:48.992
a universally fatal condition.

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:52.300
So, just take a moment.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.632
It's called pre-death.

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:58.704
Every single one of you has it, because
you have the risk factor for it,

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:00.448
which is being alive.

00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:03.506
But I have some good news for you,
because

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:07.536
I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:11.465
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:14.057
we'll see if that happens for everyone,

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:17.352
you will be a pre-vivor.

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:22.168
I made up pre-death.

00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:26.280
If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.865
I think I made it up.

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:29.432
I didn't make up pre-vivor.

00:05:29.432 --> 00:05:34.904
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who

00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:36.176
just has a risk factor,

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:38.698
but hasn't actually had that cancer,

00:05:38.698 --> 00:05:40.072
to call themselves.

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:41.647
You are a pre-vivor.

00:05:41.647 --> 00:05:46.120
We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.625
audience, I'd like to suggest

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:51.832
a reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."

00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:55.333
If you develop a disease, you're off
the island.

00:05:55.333 --> 00:06:00.468
But the problem is, we have a system

00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:02.340
that is completely --

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.267
basically promoted this.

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:07.133
We've selected, at every point in this system,

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:11.120
to do what we do, and to give everyone a
precondition and then eventually

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.099
a condition, in some cases.

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.592
Start with the doctor-patient
relationship. Doctors, most of them,

00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:22.618
are in a fee-for-service system. They are
basically incentivized to do more --

00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:24.275
procedures, tests,

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:25.941
prescribe medications.

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.306
Patients come to them,

00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:31.306
they want to do something. We're
Americans, we can't just stand

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:34.187
there, we have to do something. And so
they want a drug.

00:06:34.187 --> 00:06:37.962
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:40.282
you treat it. If the doctor
doesn't give you that,

00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:42.106
you go somewhere else.

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:43.986
That's not very good for doctors'
business.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.674
Or even worse,

00:06:45.674 --> 00:06:49.633
if you are diagnosed with something
eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:51.857
you get sued.

00:06:51.857 --> 00:06:54.889
We have pharmaceutical companies that are
constantly trying to expand

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.233
the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:03.026
because that obviously helps their bottom line.
We have advocacy groups,

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.281
like the one that's come up with
pre-vivor,

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:09.521
who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,

00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.650
so that they can raise more funds

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.265
and raise visibility, et cetera.

00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:16.105
But this isn't actually,

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:19.201
despite what journalists typically do,
this isn't actually about blaming

00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:20.489
particular players.

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.290
We are all responsible.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.732
I'm responsible.

00:07:23.732 --> 00:07:26.770
I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk
about

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.962
rooting for the worst
possible

00:07:29.962 --> 00:07:32.572
offender when it comes to doing
everything you can do.

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:34.109
Thank you.

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:38.073
But everyone is responsible.

00:07:38.073 --> 00:07:40.978
I went to medical school,

00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:45.730
and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.393
or How Not to Order Tests.

00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:50.044
We have this system

00:07:50.044 --> 00:07:52.561
where that's what you do.

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:55.186
And it actually took being a journalist

00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:59.089
to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:00.308
there are no bad people,

00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:02.185
there are just bad incentives.

00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:03.793
And that's actually true.

00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:07.250
Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.560
So when you put another MRI in
every corner, you put a robot

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.098
in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:19.914
Well, we've created a system where if you
build it, they will come.

00:08:19.914 --> 00:08:23.441
But you can actually perversely

00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:26.225
tell people to come, convince them

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:27.914
that they have to come.

00:08:27.914 --> 00:08:32.539
It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,

00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:34.746
and how we all are part of this problem.

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:38.402
I was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,

00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:41.795
every day, that were trying to,

00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:44.792
not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:47.815
But, you know, there are ways out.

00:08:47.815 --> 00:08:49.687
I saw my own internist last week,

00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:52.219
and he said to me,

00:08:52.219 --> 00:08:54.736
"You know," and he told me something that

00:08:54.736 --> 00:08:57.210
everyone in this audience could have
told me for free,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.698
but I paid him for the privilege, which
is that

00:08:59.698 --> 00:09:01.367
I need to lose some weight.

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:05.824
Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:07.537
for a dozen years now, same

00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:09.311
age my father got it,

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:13.098
and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual

00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:15.071
hypertension, high blood pressure.

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:16.056
Well, he's right,

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.136
but he didn't say to me,

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:20.823
well, you have pre-obesity or

00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:24.168
you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:27.544
better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.

00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:30.703
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.704
or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:34.744
So that's, to me,

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:36.375
a way forward.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.739
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same
thing.

00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:40.275
He learned,

00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:43.792
from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:48.667
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
wasn't swinging at every pitch

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:53.427
like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:54.776
they like to pick up those guys.

00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:59.365
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.604
the guys who like to walk,

00:10:00.604 --> 00:10:02.308
because getting on base by a walk

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:05.076
is just as good, and in our healthcare
system

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.516
we need to figure out,

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:08.092
is that really a good pitch

00:10:08.092 --> 00:10:11.010
or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.785
Thanks.
