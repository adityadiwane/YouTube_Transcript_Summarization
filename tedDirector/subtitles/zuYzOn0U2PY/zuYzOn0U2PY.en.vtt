00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:20.091
When I was considering a career in the art world,

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:23.385
I took a course in London,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.838
and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:31.799
called Pietro, who drank too much,

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:37.288
smoked too much and swore much too much.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:40.464
But he was a passionate teacher,

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:43.506
and I remember one of our earlier classes with him,

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.854
he was projecting images on the wall,

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:48.747
asking us to think about them,

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:51.273
and he put up an image of a painting.

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:54.968
It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.756
drinking wine. There was a nude woman

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:01.132
in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:05.146
there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:07.495
and he said, "What is this?"

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:10.772
And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:14.133
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.786
He said, "It's a what?"

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:18.380
I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.455
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:25.178
He said, "It's a what?"

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:28.262
I said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." (Laughter)

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.607
He said, "You boneless bookworm!

00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:34.150
It's a fucking orgy!"

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.221
(Laughter)

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.573
As I said, he swore too much.

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:43.105
There was an important lesson for me in that.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:46.933
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training,

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:50.865
art history training, because he feared

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:54.627
that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:59.306
classified things rather than looking at them,

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:04.065
and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:07.069
and he wanted us to use our eyes,

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.579
and he was especially evangelical about this message,

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.082
because he was losing his sight.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:17.441
He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.987
What is it? How is it made? Why was it made?

00:02:20.987 --> 00:02:23.754
How is it used?

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:25.923
And these were important lessons to me when

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:29.221
I subsequently became a professional art historian.

00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:33.944
My kind of eureka moment came a few years later,

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:39.041
when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:42.689
and of course it was very much discussed in terms of

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.073
the paintings and the sculptures

00:02:45.073 --> 00:02:48.381
and the architecture of the day.

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.218
But as I began to read historical documents

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:55.333
and contemporary descriptions,

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.495
I found there was a kind of a missing component,

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:03.581
for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.

00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.477
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages

00:03:07.477 --> 00:03:10.409
and, really, well into the 18th century,

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.903
and it was pretty apparent why.

00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:15.898
Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up,

00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:18.543
send them ahead of you, and in the time

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:22.061
it took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.183
dank interior into a richly colored setting.

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:31.110
Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.767
on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes

00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:37.469
with whom they wanted to be associated,

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.527
or even themselves,

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:44.925
and in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:48.594
They required scores of highly skilled weavers

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.430
working over extended periods of time

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.231
with very expensive materials -- the wools, the silks,

00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:58.068
even gold and silver thread.

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:02.806
So, all in all, in an age when the visual image

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:08.158
of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:11.803
form of propaganda.

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:15.831
Well, I became a tapestry historian.

00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:18.835
In due course, I ended up as a curator

00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:22.391
at the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.103
as one of the few places where I could organize

00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:29.658
really big exhibitions about the subject

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:32.999
I cared so passionately about.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:37.385
And in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.728
gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:46.308
for 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:49.799
It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:53.204
of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.

00:04:53.204 --> 00:04:56.668
They have to be wound on huge rollers,

00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:00.630
shipped in oversized freighters.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.257
Some of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,

00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:07.953
we had to take them up the great steps at the front.

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:12.638
We thought very hard about how to present this

00:05:12.638 --> 00:05:16.246
unknown subject to a modern audience:

00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:19.216
the dark colors to set off the colors that remained

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.017
in objects that were often faded;

00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:26.236
the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:27.700
the labeling.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.504
You know, we live in an age where we are so used

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.516
to television images and photographs,

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:38.563
a one-hit image. These were big, complex things,

00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:43.028
almost like cartoons with multiple narratives.

00:05:43.028 --> 00:05:46.258
We had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,

00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:49.183
to explore the objects.

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:53.333
There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:56.721
I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,

00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:59.836
"This is going to be a bomb."

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:04.106
But in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:09.693
hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:14.338
The exhibition was designed to be an experience,

00:06:14.338 --> 00:06:17.496
and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:20.495
So I want you to use your imaginations,

00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:24.041
thinking of these wall-high objects,

00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:26.156
some of them 10 meters wide,

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:31.175
depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:35.744
who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:39.950
thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.090
in pursuit of wild boars and deer,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.940
violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.102
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,

00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:56.939
and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys,

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.760
and then the thing that caught their attention

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.869
was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.534
pooping in the foreground — (Laughter) —

00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:09.216
kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.

00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:11.690
And you can just imagine them.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.063
But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw

00:07:15.063 --> 00:07:18.143
that these weren't just old faded tapestries.

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:22.634
These were images of the world in the past,

00:07:22.634 --> 00:07:25.550
and that it was the same for our audience.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.107
And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.

00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:34.257
Through this experience that could only be created

00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:38.340
in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience --

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.481
historians, artists, press, the general public --

00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:47.157
to the beauty of this lost medium.

00:07:47.157 --> 00:07:50.731
A few years later, I was invited to be the director

00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:53.846
of the museum, and after I got over that --

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:59.357
"Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" --

00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:04.737
I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that

00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:08.016
curated museum experience.

00:08:08.016 --> 00:08:11.623
We live in an age of ubiquitous information,

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:15.682
and sort of "just add water" expertise,

00:08:15.682 --> 00:08:19.724
but there's nothing that compares with the presentation

00:08:19.724 --> 00:08:23.608
of significant objects in a well-told narrative,

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:28.668
what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,

00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:33.179
esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.262
of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it

00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:38.429
for a general audience.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.956
And that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:46.939
of my job, supporting the vision of my curators,

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:50.292
whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:55.376
early Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:58.450
or the show we heard mentioned earlier,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.465
the McQueen show, with which we enjoyed

00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:04.276
so much success last summer.

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:06.777
That was an interesting case.

00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:11.951
In the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:14.863
McQueen's suicide,

00:09:14.863 --> 00:09:19.119
our curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:22.354
and said, "I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:26.912
and now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."

00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:31.649
It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career

00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:35.103
with a small team of designers and managers

00:09:35.103 --> 00:09:39.245
who were very protective of his legacy,

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.079
but Andrew went to London and worked with them

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:44.809
over the summer and won their confidence, and that of

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:48.904
the designers who created his amazing fashion shows,

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:53.518
which were works of performance art in their own right,

00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:56.017
and we proceeded to do something at the museum,

00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:58.237
I think, we've never done before.

00:09:58.237 --> 00:10:01.254
It wasn't just your standard installation.

00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:05.444
In fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate

00:10:05.444 --> 00:10:10.856
entirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,

00:10:10.856 --> 00:10:13.729
a hall of mirrors,

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:16.257
a curiosity box,

00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:19.617
a sunken ship, a burned-out interior,

00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:22.909
with videos and soundtracks that ranged from

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:26.642
operatic arias to pigs fornicating.

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:31.603
And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes

00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:37.037
were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.216
It could have been a train wreck.

00:10:39.216 --> 00:10:43.675
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:47.298
at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew

00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:51.291
connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling

00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:54.715
the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:57.522
and the show was quite transcendant,

00:10:57.522 --> 00:11:00.294
and it became a phenomenon in its own right.

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:02.808
By the end of the show, we had people queuing

00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:06.310
for four or five hours to get into the show,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.937
but no one really complained.

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:12.015
I heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.

00:11:12.015 --> 00:11:16.094
It was a such a visceral, emotive experience."

00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:20.351
Now, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:25.760
but I also believe that collections, individual objects,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.965
can also have that same power.

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:31.849
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art,

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:34.954
but of an encyclopedic museum,

00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:39.769
and today, 140 years later, that vision

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:42.907
is as prescient as ever,

00:11:42.907 --> 00:11:46.530
because, of course, we live in a world of crisis,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.163
of challenge, and we're exposed to it

00:11:49.163 --> 00:11:52.312
through the 24/7 newsreels.

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:57.172
It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,

00:11:57.172 --> 00:12:01.552
the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.

00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:05.881
Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,

00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:08.591
it's in our galleries that we can explain

00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:10.663
and give greater understanding.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:14.148
I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,

00:12:14.148 --> 00:12:19.828
opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.

00:12:19.828 --> 00:12:24.262
I think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world

00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:28.113
was pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:32.206
in one of America's darkest hours,

00:12:32.206 --> 00:12:34.880
and the perception was through the polarization

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.534
of that terrible event.

00:12:37.534 --> 00:12:41.754
Now, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries

00:12:41.754 --> 00:12:46.207
of the development of different Islamic cultures

00:12:46.207 --> 00:12:48.946
across a vast geographic spread,

00:12:48.946 --> 00:12:52.973
and, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:58.148
to see these galleries since they opened last October.

00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:05.254
I'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"

00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:09.131
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection

00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:12.571
of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:15.846
I'm a huge advocate of the Web.

00:13:15.846 --> 00:13:19.265
It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:24.666
around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity

00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:31.253
of the object presented with passionate scholarship.

00:13:31.253 --> 00:13:35.856
Bringing people face to face with our objects

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:39.303
is a way of bringing them face to face with people

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:43.869
across time, across space, whose lives may have been

00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:48.437
very different to our own, but who, like us,

00:13:48.437 --> 00:13:53.467
had hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:56.646
in their lives. And I think this is a process

00:13:56.646 --> 00:14:00.399
that helps us better understand ourselves,

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:05.907
helps us make better decisions about where we're going.

00:14:05.907 --> 00:14:11.309
The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:15.453
awe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.

00:14:15.453 --> 00:14:17.734
From there, you can walk in any direction

00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:20.965
to almost any culture.

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.361
I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries

00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:26.436
and I watch our visitors coming in.

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:30.528
Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home.

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:33.138
They know what they're looking for.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:37.594
Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.748
They feel that the institution is elitist.

00:14:40.748 --> 00:14:46.943
I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.

00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:50.891
I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:57.048
where they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,

00:14:57.048 --> 00:15:00.870
to see the unfamiliar in the familiar,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.339
or to try the unknown.

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:09.680
Because for us, it's all about bringing them face to face

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.605
with great works of art,

00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:17.005
capturing them at that moment of discomfort,

00:15:17.005 --> 00:15:20.501
when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,

00:15:20.501 --> 00:15:25.904
your Blackberry, but to create a zone

00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:31.010
where their curiosity can expand.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.574
And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture

00:15:34.574 --> 00:15:36.564
that reminds you of a friend,

00:15:36.564 --> 00:15:40.844
or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,

00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:44.254
or, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:46.931
those dancing figures

00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:49.718
who are indeed knocking back the wine,

00:15:49.718 --> 00:15:53.208
and that nude figure in the left foreground.

00:15:53.208 --> 00:16:01.553
Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.

00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:07.175
In that moment, our scholarship can tell you

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.489
that this is a bacchanal,

00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:13.640
but if we're doing our job right,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.376
and you've checked the jargon at the front door,

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:20.244
trust your instinct.

00:16:20.244 --> 00:16:23.416
You know it's an orgy.

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:26.734
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:31.641
(Applause)
