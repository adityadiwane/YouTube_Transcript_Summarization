00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.569
I'll just start talking
about the 17th century.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:22.306
I hope nobody finds that offensive.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.306
I -- you know, when I --
after I had invented PCR,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.306
I kind of needed a change.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.306
And I moved down to La Jolla
and learned how to surf.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.306
And I started living down there
on the beach for a long time.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.306
And when surfers are out waiting

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.306
for waves,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.306
you probably wonder, if you've never
been out there, what are they doing?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.306
You know, sometimes there's a 10-,
15-minute break out there

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
when you're waiting for a wave to come in.

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:45.354
They usually talk about the 17th century.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.306
You know, they get a real
bad rap in the world.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
People think they're sort of lowbrows.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.473
One day, somebody suggested
I read this book.

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.306
It was called --

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.306
it was called "The Air Pump,"

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.759
or something like "The
Leviathan and The Air Pump."

00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:04.306
It was a real weird book
about the 17th century.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.306
And I realized, the roots

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.306
of the way I sort of thought

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.306
was just the only natural
way to think about things.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.306
That -- you know, I was born
thinking about things that way,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.306
and I had always
been like a little scientist guy.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.306
And when I went to find out something,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.306
I used scientific methods.
I wasn't real surprised,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.306
you know, when they first told me how --

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.306
how you were supposed to do science,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
because I'd already been doing it
for fun and whatever.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.306
But it didn't -- it never occurred to me

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.306
that it had to be invented

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.306
and that it had been invented

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.306
only 350 years ago.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.306
You know, it was --

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.306
like it happened in England,
and Germany, and Italy

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.306
sort of all at the same time.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.306
And the story of that,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.306
I thought, was really fascinating.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.473
So I'm going to talk
a little bit about that,

00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:53.306
and what exactly is it
that scientists are supposed to do.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.306
And it's, it's a kind of --

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.306
You know, Charles I got beheaded

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.306
somewhere early in the 17th century.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.306
And the English set up Cromwell

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.473
and a whole bunch
of Republicans or whatever,

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:07.497
and not the kind of Republicans we had.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
They changed the government,
and it didn't work.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
And

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
Charles II, the son,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.521
was finally put back
on the throne of England.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:23.831
He was really nervous,
because his dad had been,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.616
you know, beheaded for being
the King of England

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
And he was nervous about the fact

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.306
that conversations that got going

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.306
in, like, bars and stuff

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.306
would turn to --

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.306
this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.306
but people in the 17th century in England

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.306
were starting to talk about, you know,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.306
philosophy and stuff in bars.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.306
They didn't have TV screens,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.664
and they didn't have
any football games to watch.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.306
And they would get really pissy,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.569
and all of a sudden people would spill
out into the street and fight

00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:54.306
about issues like whether or not

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.306
it was okay if Robert Boyle

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.306
made a device called the vacuum pump.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.306
Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.306
He was a Christian guy
during the weekends,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.306
but during the week he was a scientist.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.306
(Laughter)

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.306
Which was -- back then it was

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.306
sort of, you know, well, you know --

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.854
if you made this thing --
he made this little device,

00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:19.306
like kind of like a bicycle pump

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.306
in reverse that could suck
all the air out of --

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.306
you know what a bell jar is?
One of these things,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.664
you pick it up, put it
down, and it's got a seal,

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:28.306
and you can see inside of it,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.306
so you can see what's going
on inside this thing.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.306
But what he was trying to do
was to pump all the air out of there,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.306
and see what would happen inside there.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.378
I mean, the first -- I think
one of the first experiments he did

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.306
was he put a bird in there.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.306
And people in the 17th century,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.306
they didn't really understand
the same way we do

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.306
about you know, this stuff is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.306
a bunch of different kinds of molecules,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.306
and we breathe it
in for a purpose and all that.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.306
I mean, fish don't know much about water,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.306
and people didn't know much about air.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.306
But both started exploring it.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.306
One thing, he put a bird in there,
and he pumped all the air out,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.306
and the bird died. So he said, hmm...

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.306
He said -- he called
what he'd done as making --

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.521
they didn't call it
a vacuum pump at the time.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.306
Now you call it a vacuum
pump; he called it a vacuum.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.306
Right? And immediately,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.306
he got into trouble with the local clergy

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.306
who said, you can't make a vacuum.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.306
Ah, uh --

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.306
(Laughter)

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.306
Aristotle said that nature abhors one.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.426
I think it was a poor
translation, probably,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.306
but people relied
on authorities like that.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.306
And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.306
I make them all the time.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.306
I mean, whatever
that is that kills the bird --

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.306
and I'm calling it a vacuum.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.306
And the religious people said that

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.306
if God wanted you to make --

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.306
I mean, God is everywhere,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.711
that was one of their rules,
is God is everywhere.

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:56.831
And a vacuum --
there's nothing in a vacuum,

00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:59.306
so you've -- God couldn't be in there.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.569
So therefore the church said that you
can't make a vacuum, you know.

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:04.306
And Boyle said, bullshit.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.306
I mean, you want to call it Godless,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.306
you know, you call it Godless.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.306
But that's not my job. I'm not into that.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
I do that on the weekend. And like --

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.306
what I'm trying to do
is figure out what happens

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.306
when you suck everything
out of a compartment.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.473
And he did all these
cute little experiments.

00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:24.306
Like he did one with --
he had a little wheel,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
like a fan, that was

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.306
sort of loosely attached,
so it could spin by itself.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.306
He had another fan opposed to it

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.306
that he had like a --

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.306
I mean, the way I would have done
this would be, like, a rubber band,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.569
and, you know, around a tinker
toy kind of fan.

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:41.593
I know exactly how he did
it; I've seen the drawings.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.306
It's two fans, one which he could
turn from outside

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.306
after he got the vacuum established,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.306
and he discovered that if he pulled
all the air out of it,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.306
the one fan would no longer
turn the other one, right?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.306
Something was missing, you know.
I mean, these are --

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.306
it's kind of weird to think that someone
had to do an experiment to show that,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
but that was what was going
on at the time.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:04.306
And like, there was big arguments about it

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.616
in the -- you know, the gin houses
and in the coffee shops and stuff.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.306
And Charles

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.306
started not liking that.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Charles II was kind of saying, you
know, you should keep that --

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.306
let's make a place where
you can do this stuff

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.306
where people don't get so -- you know,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.306
we don't want the -- we don't want to get
the people mad at me again. And so --

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.306
because when they started
talking about religion

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.306
and science and stuff like that,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.997
that's when it had sort of gotten
his father in trouble.

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:32.306
And so,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.378
Charles said, I'm going
to put up the money

00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:36.306
give you guys a building,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.378
come here and you can
meet in the building,

00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:40.498
but just don't talk
about religion in there.

00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:42.306
And that was fine with Boyle.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.997
He said, OK, we're going
to start having these meetings.

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.306
And anybody who wants to do science is --

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.306
this is about the time that Isaac
Newton was starting to whip out

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.306
a lot of really interesting things.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.664
And there was all kind of people
that would come to the Royal Society,

00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:57.306
they called it. You had to be
dressed up pretty well.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.306
It wasn't like a TED conference.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.306
That was the only criteria,
was that you be --

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
you looked like a gentleman,
and they'd let anybody could come.

00:07:04.354 --> 00:07:06.306
You didn't have to be a member then.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.521
And so, they would come
in and you would do --

00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:11.306
Anybody that was going
to show an experiment,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.306
which was kind of a new word at the time,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.306
demonstrate some principle,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.306
they had to do it on stage,
where everybody could see it.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.306
So they were --

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.306
the really important part of this was,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.306
you were not supposed to talk

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.306
about final causes, for instance.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.306
And God was out of the picture.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
The actual nature of reality
was not at issue.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.473
You're not supposed to talk
about the absolute nature of anything.

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.593
You were not supposed
to talk about anything

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:40.306
that you couldn't demonstrate.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.807
So if somebody could see it, you could
say, here's how the machine works,

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.831
here's what we do, and then
here's what happens.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.306
And seeing what happens, it was OK

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.306
to generalize,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.306
and say, I'm sure that this
will happen anytime

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.306
we make one of these things.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
And so you can start making up some rules.

00:07:58.354 --> 00:08:01.306
You say, anytime you have a vacuum state,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.306
you will discover that one wheel
will not turn another one,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.306
if the only connection between them

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.306
is whatever was there before the vacuum.
That kind of thing.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.306
Candles can't burn in a vacuum,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.306
therefore, probably
sparklers wouldn't either.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.306
It's not clear; actually sparklers will,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.306
but they didn't know that.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.306
They didn't have sparklers. But, they --

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.306
(Laughter)

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.664
-- you can make up rules,
but they have to relate

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.306
only to the things
that you've been able to demonstrate.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.306
And most the demonstrations
had to do with visuals.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.306
Like if you do an experiment on stage,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.306
and nobody can see it, they can just hear it,
they would probably think you were freaky.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.306
I mean, reality is what you can see.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.306
That wasn't an explicit
rule in the meeting,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.306
but I'm sure that was part of it,
you know. If people hear voices,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.306
and they can't see and associate
it with somebody,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.306
that person's probably not there.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.378
But the general idea
that you could only --

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.854
you could only really talk
about things in that place

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.306
that had some kind of experimental basis.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.306
It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.306
who was a local philosopher,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.306
said about it, you know,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.854
because you weren't going
to be talking final causes.

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:11.306
What's happening here,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.306
in the middle of the 17th century,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.306
was that what became my field --

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.306
science, experimental science --

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.306
was pulling itself away,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.306
and it was in a physical way, because we're
going to do it in this room over here,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.306
but it was also what -- it
was an amazing thing that happened.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.306
Science had been all interlocked

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.306
with theology, and philosophy,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.306
and -- and -- and mathematics,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
which is really not science.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.378
But experimental science had
been tied up with all those things.

00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:40.306
And the mathematics part

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.306
and the experimental science part

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.306
was pulling away from philosophy.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.306
And -- things --

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.306
we never looked back.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
It's been so cool since then.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.306
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled
a thing that was really impeding

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.306
technology from being developed.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.306
And, I mean, everybody in this room --

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.306
now, this is 350 short years ago.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.306
Remember, that's a short time.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
It was 300,000, probably, years ago

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.306
that most of us, the ancestors
of most of us in this room

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.473
came up out of Africa
and turned to the left.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.306
You know, the ones that turned
to the right, there are some of those

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.306
in the Japanese translation.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.306
But that happened very -- a long time ago

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.306
compared to

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.306
350 short years ago.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.306
But in that 350 years,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.306
the place has just undergone
a lot of changes.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.306
In fact, everybody in this room probably,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.306
especially if you picked up your bag --

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.306
some of you, I know, didn't
pick up your bags --

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.306
but if you picked up your bag,
everybody in this room

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.569
has got in their pocket,
or back in their room,

00:10:40.593 --> 00:10:42.306
something

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.306
that 350 years ago,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
kings would have gone to war to have.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.306
I mean, if you can think how important --

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.306
If you have a GPS system
and there are no satellites,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.378
it's not going to be much use.
But, like --

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.450
but, you know, if somebody
had a GPS system

00:10:55.474 --> 00:10:58.306
in the 17th century

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.306
some king would have
gotten together an army

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.306
and gone to get it, you know.
If that person --

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.473
Audience: For the teddy bear?
The teddy bear?

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.450
Kary Mullis: They might have done
it for the teddy bear, yeah.

00:11:07.474 --> 00:11:09.306
But -- all of us own stuff.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.306
I mean, individuals own things

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.807
that kings would have
definitely gone to war to get.

00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:15.306
And this is just 350 years.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.378
Not a whole lot of people
doing this stuff.

00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:19.306
You know, the important people --

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.306
you can almost read about their lives,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.521
about all the really important
people that made advances, you know.

00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:26.306
And, I mean --

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.306
this kind of stuff, you
know, all this stuff

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.306
came from that separation

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.306
of this little sort of thing that we do --

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.306
now I, when I was a boy

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.306
was born sort of with this idea

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.306
that if you want to know something --

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.306
you know, maybe it's because my old
man was gone a lot,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.521
and my mother didn't
really know much science,

00:11:44.545 --> 00:11:47.212
but I thought if you want
to know something about stuff,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.521
you do it -- you make
an experiment, you know.

00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:51.306
You get -- you get, like --

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.306
I just had a natural feeling for science

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.306
and setting up experiments. I thought
that was the way everybody had always thought.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.306
I thought that anybody
with any brains will do it that way.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.306
It isn't true. I mean,
there's a lot of people --

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.306
You know, I was one of those
scientists that was --

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
got into trouble the other night at dinner

00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.306
because of the post-modernism thing.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.306
And I didn't mean, you know
-- where is that lady?

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.306
Audience: Here.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.306
(Laughter)

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.997
KM: I mean, I didn't really
think of that as an argument

00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.306
so much as just a lively discussion.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
I didn't take it personally, but --

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.306
I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
until this surfing experience
started me into the 17th century,

00:12:27.354 --> 00:12:29.593
I'd thought that's just
the way people thought,

00:12:29.617 --> 00:12:32.306
and everybody did,
and they recognized reality

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.616
by what they could see
or touch or feel or hear.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
At any rate, when I was a boy,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.306
I, like, for instance, I had this --

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.306
I got this little book
from Fort Sill, Oklahoma --

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.521
This is about the time
that George Dyson's dad

00:12:46.545 --> 00:12:48.306
was starting to blow nuclear --

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.306
thinking about blowing
up nuclear rockets and stuff.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.306
I was thinking about making
my own little rockets.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.306
And I knew that frogs -- little frogs --

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.306
had aspirations of space travel,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.306
just like people. And I --

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.306
(Laughter)

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.306
I was looking for a --

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.306
a propulsion system

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.306
that would like, make a rocket, like,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.759
maybe about four feet high
go up a couple of miles.

00:13:12.783 --> 00:13:15.306
And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.664
I wanted it to go out of sight and then
I wanted this little parachute

00:13:18.688 --> 00:13:21.306
to come back with the frog in it.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.306
And -- I -- I --

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.306
I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.306
where there's a missile base.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
They send it out for amateur rocketeers,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.306
and

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.306
it said in there

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.306
do not ever heat a mixture
of potassium perchlorate and sugar.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.306
(Laughter)

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.306
You know,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.306
that's what you call a lead.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.306
(Laughter)

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.306
You sort of -- now you say,
well, let's see if I can

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.306
get hold of some potassium chlorate
and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.306
and heat it; it would be interesting to see
what it is they don't want me to do,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.902
and what it is going to --
and how is it going to work.

00:13:56.926 --> 00:13:58.306
And we didn't have --

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.306
like, my mother

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.306
presided over the back yard

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.306
from an upstairs window,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.306
where she would be ironing
or something like that.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.306
And she was usually just
sort of keeping an eye on,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.521
and if there was any puffs
of smoke out there,

00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:13.306
she'd lean out and admonish us all

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
not to blow our eyes out. That was her --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.306
You know, that was kind of the worst
thing that could happen to us.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.330
That's why I thought, as long
as I don't blow my eyes out...

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.306
I may not care about the fact

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.306
that it's prohibited
from heating this solution.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.473
I'm going to do it
carefully, but I'll do it.

00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:31.497
It's like anything else that's prohibited:

00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:33.306
you do it behind the garage.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.306
(Laughter)

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.306
So, I went to the drug store

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.306
and I tried to buy
some potassium perchlorate

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.306
and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.306
to walk into a drug store
and buy chemicals.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.306
Nowadays, it's no ma'am,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.306
check your shoes. And like --

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.306
(Laughter)

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.306
But then it wasn't -- they didn't
have any, but the guy had --

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.306
I said, what kind of salts
of potassium do you have? You know.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.306
And he had potassium nitrate.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.306
And I said, that might do
the same thing, whatever it is.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.306
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets
or it wouldn't be in that manual.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.306
And so I -- I did some experiments.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.616
You know, I started
off with little tiny amounts

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.306
of potassium nitrate and sugar,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.306
which was readily available,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.306
and I mixed it in different proportions,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
and I tried to light it on fire.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.997
Just to see what would happen,
if you mixed it together.

00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:21.306
And it -- they burned.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.306
It burned kind of slow,
but it made a nice smell,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.378
compared to other rocket
fuels I had tried,

00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:27.306
that all had sulfur in them.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
And, it smelt like burnt candy.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.306
And then I tried the melting
business, and I melted it.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.306
And then it melted into a little sort
of syrupy liquid, brown.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.306
And then it cooled
down to a brick-hard substance,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.306
that when you lit that,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.306
it went off like a bat.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.306
I mean, the little bowl of that stuff
that had cooled down --

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.306
you'd light it, and it would just
start dancing around the yard.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.306
And I said, there

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.306
is a way to get a frog
up to where he wants to go.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.306
(Laughter)

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.306
So I started developing --

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.330
you know, George's dad had a lot of help.
I just had my brother.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.306
But I -- it took me
about -- it took me about,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.306
I'd say, six months

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.378
to finally figure
out all the little things.

00:16:07.402 --> 00:16:09.306
There's a lot of little things involved

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.521
in making a rocket that it
will actually work,

00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:13.306
even after you have the fuel.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.306
But you do it, by -- what I just--

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.306
you know, you do experiments,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.306
and you write down things sometimes,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.306
you make observations, you know.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.306
And then you slowly build up a theory

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.306
of how this stuff works.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.426
And it was --
I was following all the rules.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.306
I didn't know what the rules were,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.306
I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.306
or some kind of a throwback
to the 17th century, whatever.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.306
But at any rate, we finally did

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.306
have a device that would reproduceably

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.306
put a frog out of sight

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.306
and get him back alive.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.306
And we had not --

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.306
I mean, we weren't frightened by it.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.759
We should have been,
because it made a lot of smoke

00:16:50.783 --> 00:16:52.306
and it made a lot of noise,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.306
and it was powerful, you know.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.306
And once in a while, they would blow up.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.306
But I wasn't worried, by the way,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.306
about, you know,

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.306
the explosion causing
the destruction of the planet.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.306
I hadn't heard about the 10 ways

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.306
that we should be afraid of the --

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.306
By the way,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.306
I could have thought,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.306
I'd better not do this because

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.306
they say not to, you know.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.306
And I'd better get permission
from the government.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.306
If I'd have waited around for that,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
I would have never -- the frog
would have died, you know.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.306
At any rate, I bring it
up because it's a good story,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.306
and he said, tell personal things,
you know, and that's a personal --

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.330
I was going to tell you about the first
night that I met my wife,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.426
but that would be too
personal, wouldn't it.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.759
So, so I've got something
else that's not personal.

00:17:35.783 --> 00:17:38.306
But that... process
is what I think of as science,

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.306
see, where you start with some idea,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
and then instead of, like, looking up,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.306
every authority that you've ever heard of

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.306
I -- sometimes you do that,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.306
if you're going to write a paper later,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.306
you want to figure
out who else has worked on it.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.473
But in the actual process,
you get an idea --

00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:56.306
like, when I got the idea one night

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.306
that I could amplify DNA
with two oligonucleotides,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.188
and I could make lots of copies
of some little piece of DNA,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.306
you know, the thinking for that

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
was about 20 minutes
while I was driving my car,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.902
and then instead of going -- I went
back and I did talk to people about it,

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:16.117
but if I'd listened to what I heard
from all my friends who were molecular biologists --

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.306
I would have abandoned it.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.306
You know, if I had gone back
looking for an authority figure

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.330
who could tell me if it would work or not,

00:18:22.354 --> 00:18:24.354
he would have said, no, it probably won't.

00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:27.354
Because the results of it
were so spectacular

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.306
that if it worked it was going to change
everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.306
Nobody wants a chemist to come in

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.306
and poke around in their stuff
like that and change things.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.306
But if you go to authority,
and you always don't --

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.378
you don't always get
the right answer, see.

00:18:40.402 --> 00:18:42.306
But I knew, you'd go into the lab

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.306
and you'd try to make it work yourself.
And then you're the authority,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.306
and you can say, I know it works,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.306
because right there in that tube

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.306
is where it happened,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.306
and here, on this gel,
there's a little band there

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.330
that I know that's DNA,
and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,

00:18:55.354 --> 00:18:57.306
so there! So it does work.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.306
You know, that's how you do science.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.306
And then you say, well,
what can make it work better?

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.306
And then you figure out better
and better ways to do it.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.330
But you always work from, from like, facts

00:19:05.354 --> 00:19:08.306
that you have made available to you

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.306
by doing experiments: things
that you could do on a stage.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.306
And no tricky shit behind the thing.
I mean, it's all --

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.306
you've got to be very honest

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.306
with what you're doing if it
really is going to work.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.306
I mean, you can't make up results,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.664
and then do another experiment
based on that one.

00:19:21.688 --> 00:19:23.306
So you have to be honest.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.306
And I'm basically honest.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.306
I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty
would always get me in trouble,

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.997
if I, like -- so I've just
sort of been naturally honest

00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:33.021
and naturally inquisitive,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.569
and that sort of leads
to that kind of science.

00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:37.306
Now, let's see...

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.306
I've got another five minutes, right?

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.330
OK. All scientists aren't like that.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.306
You know -- and there is a lot --

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.306
(Laughter)

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.569
There is a lot -- a lot
has been going on since

00:19:50.593 --> 00:19:53.306
Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.306
One of the things that happened
right around World War II

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.306
in that same time period before,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.306
and as sure as hell afterwards,

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
government got -- realized
that scientists aren't strange dudes

00:20:02.354 --> 00:20:05.306
that, you know, hide in ivory towers

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.306
and do ridiculous things with test tube.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.306
Scientists, you know, made World War II

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.306
as we know it quite possible.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.330
They made faster things.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.306
They made bigger guns
to shoot them down with.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.306
You know, they made drugs
to give the pilots

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.306
if they were broken up in the process.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.306
They made all kinds of --
and then finally one giant bomb

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.306
to end the whole thing, right?

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.306
And everybody stepped back
a little and said, you know,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.306
we ought to invest in this shit,

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.306
because whoever has got
the most of these people

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.306
working in the places is going
to have a dominant position,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.306
at least in the military, and probably
in all kind of economic ways.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.306
And they got involved
in it, and the scientific

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.306
and industrial establishment was born,

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.306
and out of that came a lot of scientists

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.306
who were in there for the money, you know,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.306
because it was suddenly available.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.306
And they weren't the curious little boys

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.306
that liked to put frogs up in the air.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.306
They were the same people that later
went in to medical school, you know,

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.306
because there was money in it, you know. I mean,
later, then they all got into business --

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.306
I mean, there are waves of --
going into your high school,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.306
person saying, you want to be rich, you know,
be a scientist. You know, not anymore.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.330
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.831
But a lot of people got in it for the money
and the power and the travel.

00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:17.831
That's back when travel was easy.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.306
And those people don't think --

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.306
they don't --

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.306
they don't always tell
you the truth, you know.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.426
There is nothing
in their contract, in fact,

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.426
that makes it to their advantage always,

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.306
to tell you the truth.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.306
And the people I'm talking
about are people that like --

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.306
they say that they're
a member of the committee

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.306
called, say, the Inter-Governmental
Panel on Climate Change.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.807
And they -- and they have these big
meetings where they try to figure out

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.092
how we're going to -- how we're
going to continually prove

00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:49.306
that the planet is getting warmer,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.306
when that's actually contrary
to most people's sensations.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.306
I mean, if you actually measure

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.306
the temperature over a period --

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.473
I mean, the temperature
has been measured now

00:21:58.497 --> 00:22:01.306
pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years --

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.306
longer than that it's been measured,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.306
but in really nice, precise ways,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.306
and records have been kept
for 50 or 60 years,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.306
and in fact, the temperature
hadn't really gone up.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.306
It's like, the average temperature

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.306
has gone up a tiny little bit,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.306
because the nighttime temperatures

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.306
at the weather stations have
come up just a little bit.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.306
But there's a good explanation for that.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.426
And it's that the weather stations
are all built outside of town,

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.306
where the airport was, and now

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.306
the town's moved out there,
there's concrete all around

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.306
and they call it the skyline effect.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.306
And most responsible people

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.306
that measure temperatures realize

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.759
you have to shield
your measuring device from that.

00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:39.306
And even then, you know,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.306
because the buildings get
warm in the daytime,

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.330
and they keep it a little warmer at night.

00:22:42.354 --> 00:22:44.330
So the temperature has
been, sort of, inching up.

00:22:44.354 --> 00:22:47.306
It should have been. But not a lot.
Not like, you know --

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.306
the first guy -- the first
guy that got the idea

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.306
that we're going to fry ourselves here,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.306
actually, he didn't think of it that way.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.306
His name was Sven Arrhenius.
He was Swedish, and he said,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.306
if you double the CO2
level in the atmosphere,

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.426
which he thought might
-- this is in 1900 --

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.378
the temperature ought to go
up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.

00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:07.593
He was thinking of the earth
as, kind of like,

00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:10.306
you know, like a completely
insulated thing

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.306
with no stuff in it, really,

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.306
just energy coming down, energy leaving.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.306
And so he came up with this theory,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.306
and he said, this will be cool,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.306
because it'll be a longer
growing season in Sweden,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.306
you know, and the surfers liked it,

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.306
the surfers thought, that's a cool idea,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.306
because it's pretty cold
in the ocean sometimes, and --

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.306
but a lot of other people later on

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.378
started thinking it
would be bad, you know.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.378
But nobody actually
demonstrated it, right?

00:23:35.402 --> 00:23:37.306
I mean, the temperature as measured --

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.616
and you can find this
on our wonderful Internet,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.306
you just go and look
for all NASAs records,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.306
and all the Weather Bureau's records,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.306
and you'll look at it yourself,
and you'll see, the temperature has just --

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.330
the nighttime temperature measured
on the surface of the planet

00:23:50.354 --> 00:23:52.306
has gone up a tiny little bit.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.306
So if you just average that and the daytime
temperature, it looks like it went up

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.306
about .7 degrees in this century.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.306
But in fact, it was just coming up --

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.188
it was the nighttime; the daytime
temperatures didn't go up.

00:24:02.212 --> 00:24:04.306
So -- and Arrhenius' theory --

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.306
and all the global warmers think --

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.306
they would say, yeah, it should
go up in the daytime, too,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.306
if it's the greenhouse effect.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.306
Now, people like things
that have, like, names like that,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.306
that they can envision it, right?
I mean --

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.235
but people don't like things
like this, so -- most -- I mean,

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:21.259
you don't get all excited about things

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.306
like the actual evidence, you know,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.306
which would be evidence for strengthening

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.306
of the tropical circulation in the 1990s.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.306
It's a paper that came out in February,

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.306
and most of you probably
hadn't heard about it.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.306
"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.330
in the Tropical Mean
Radiative Energy Budget."

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.306
Excuse me. Those papers
were published by NASA,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.378
and some scientists
at Columbia, and Viliki

00:24:44.402 --> 00:24:47.306
and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.306
And those two papers came
out in Science Magazine,

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.306
February the first,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.306
and these -- the conclusion
in both of these papers,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.306
and in also the Science editor's, like,

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.426
descriptions of these
papers, for, you know,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.306
for the quickie,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.306
is that our theories about global warming

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.306
are completely wrong. I mean,

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.306
what these guys were doing,

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.306
and this is what -- the NASA people
have been saying this for a long time.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.306
They say, if you measure the temperature
of the atmosphere, it isn't going up --

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.807
it's not going up at all. We've doing
it very carefully now for 20 years,

00:25:17.831 --> 00:25:20.306
from satellites, and it isn't going up.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.306
And in this paper, they show
something much more striking,

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.306
and that was that they did
what they call a radiation --

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.306
and I'm not going to go into the details
of it, actually it's quite complicated,

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.306
but it isn't as complicated
as they might make you think it is

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.306
by the words they use in those papers.
If you really get down to it, they say,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.521
the sun puts out a certain
amount of energy --

00:25:37.545 --> 00:25:39.306
we know how much that is --

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.235
it falls on the earth, the earth
gives back a certain amount.

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:44.306
When it gets warm it generates --

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.306
it makes redder energy --
I mean, like infra-red,

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.306
like something that's warm
gives off infra-red.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.378
The whole business
of the global warming --

00:25:52.402 --> 00:25:54.306
trash, really,

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.330
is that -- if the -- if there's too
much CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:25:57.354 --> 00:25:59.306
the heat that's trying to escape

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.306
won't be able to get out. But
the heat coming from the sun,

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.306
which is mostly down in the --
it's like 350 nanometers,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.306
which is where it's centered --
that goes right through CO2.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.306
So you still get heated,
but you don't dissipate any.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.306
Well, these guys measured
all of those things.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.306
I mean, you can talk about that stuff,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.188
and you can write these large reports,
and you can get government money to do it,

00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:20.306
but these -- they actually measured it,

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.473
and it turns
out that in the last 10 years --

00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.473
that's why they say "decadal" there --

00:26:24.497 --> 00:26:27.306
that the energy -- that the level

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.306
of what they call "imbalance"

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.306
has been way the hell
over what was expected.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.306
Like, the amount of imbalance --

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.306
meaning, heat's coming
in and it's not going out

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.521
that you would get
from having double the CO2,

00:26:40.545 --> 00:26:43.306
which we're not anywhere
near that, by the way.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.306
But if we did, in 2025 or something,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.306
have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.569
they say it would be
increase the energy budget

00:26:50.593 --> 00:26:53.306
by about -- in other words,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.306
one watt per square centimeter more

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.306
would be coming in than going out.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.306
So the planet should get warmer.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.950
Well, they found out in this
study -- these two studies

00:27:02.974 --> 00:27:04.306
by two different teams --

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.306
that five and a half watts

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.306
per square meter

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.306
had been coming in from 1998, 1999,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.306
and the place didn't get warmer.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.306
So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.306
These papers should have been called,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.306
"The End to the Global
Warming Fiasco," you know.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.306
They're concerned,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.306
and you can tell they have very
guarded conclusions in these papers,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.521
because they're talking
about big laboratories

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.306
that are funded by lots of money

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.306
and by scared people.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.306
You know, if they said, you know what?

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.306
There isn't a problem
with global warming any longer,

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.306
so we can -- you know, they're funding.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.092
And if you start a grant request
with something like that,

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.759
and say, global warming
obviously hadn't happened...

00:27:42.783 --> 00:27:44.759
if they -- if they -- if they actually
-- if they actually said that,

00:27:44.783 --> 00:27:46.306
I'm getting out.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.306
(Laughter)

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.306
I'll stand up too, and --

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.306
(Laughter)

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.306
(Applause)

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.306
They have to say that.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.306
They had to be very cautious.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.473
But what I'm saying is,
you can be delighted,

00:28:02.497 --> 00:28:05.306
because the editor
of Science, who is no dummy,

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.306
and both of these fairly professional --

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.306
really professional teams, have
really come to the same conclusion

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.306
and in the bottom lines in their papers

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.330
they have to say, what this means
is, that what we've been thinking,

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.569
was the global circulation
model that we predict

00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:20.569
that the earth is going to get overheated

00:28:20.593 --> 00:28:23.306
that it's all wrong.
It's wrong by a large factor.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.306
It's not by a small one. They just --

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.306
they just misinterpreted
the fact that the earth --

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.330
there's obviously some mechanisms going on

00:28:31.354 --> 00:28:33.306
that nobody knew about,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.306
because the heat's coming
in and it isn't getting warmer.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.306
So the planet is a pretty
amazing thing, you know,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.306
it's big and horrible --
and big and wonderful,

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.306
and it does all kinds of things
we don't know anything about.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.306
So I mean, the reason I put
those things all together,

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.306
OK, here's the way you're
supposed to do science --

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.306
some science is done for other
reasons, and just curiosity.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.616
And there's a lot of things
like global warming,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.306
and ozone hole and you know,

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.330
a whole bunch of scientific public issues,

00:28:56.354 --> 00:28:58.306
that if you're interested in them,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.426
then you have to get down the details,
and read the papers called,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.306
"Large Decadal Variability in the..."

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.616
You have to figure
out what all those words mean.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.306
And if you just listen to the guys

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.306
who are hyping those issues,
and making a lot of money out of it,

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.616
you'll be misinformed, and you'll be
worrying about the wrong things.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.021
Remember the 10 things that are going
to get you. The -- one of them --

00:29:17.045 --> 00:29:18.306
(Laughter)

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.306
And the asteroids is the one I really
agree with there.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.140
I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids.
OK, thank you for having me here.

00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:28.164
(Applause)
