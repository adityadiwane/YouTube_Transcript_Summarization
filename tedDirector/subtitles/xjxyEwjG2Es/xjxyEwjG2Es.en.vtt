00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.235
Type is something we consume

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.157
in enormous quantities.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:17.239
In much of the world,

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.107
it's completely inescapable.

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:22.130
But few consumers are concerned to know

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.462
where a particular typeface came from

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:27.226
or when or who designed it,

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.579
if, indeed, there was any human agency involved

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.376
in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize

00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:37.088
out of the software ether.

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:40.613
But I do have to be concerned with those things.

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:42.130
It's my job.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.340
I'm one of the tiny handful of people

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.454
who gets badly bent out of shape

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:49.048
by the bad spacing of the T and the E

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.948
that you see there.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:52.390
I've got to take that slide off.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.461
I can't stand it. Nor can Chris.

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.122
There. Good.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.890
So my talk is about the connection

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.290
between technology and design of type.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.953
The technology has changed

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:06.825
a number of times since I started work:

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:11.486
photo, digital, desktop, screen, web.

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:13.224
I've had to survive those changes and try

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:15.928
to understand their implications for what I do

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:17.319
for design.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.489
This slide is about the effect of tools on form.

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:25.390
The two letters, the two K's,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.715
the one on your left, my right, is modern,

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:30.126
made on a computer.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.168
All straight lines are dead straight.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:34.978
The curves have that kind of
mathematical smoothness

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:38.724
that the Bézier formula imposes.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.221
On the right, ancient Gothic,

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:45.280
cut in the resistant material of steel by hand.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.405
None of the straight lines are actually straight.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:49.570
The curves are kind of subtle.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.284
It has that spark of life from the human hand

00:01:54.284 --> 00:01:56.198
that the machine or the program

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.131
can never capture.

00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.110
What a contrast.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.689
Well, I tell a lie.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.677
A lie at TED. I'm really sorry.

00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:07.798
Both of these were made on a computer,

00:02:07.798 --> 00:02:09.724
same software, same Bézier curves,

00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:11.416
same font format.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:13.950
The one on your left

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.204
was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,

00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:17.639
and I did the other one.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.995
The tool is the same, yet the letters are different.

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:22.518
The letters are different

00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:23.724
because the designers are different.

00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:26.985
That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:30.106
I wanted mine to look like that. End of story.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:32.310
Type is very adaptable.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.631
Unlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:39.030
type hides its methods.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.827
I think of myself as an industrial designer.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:43.393
The thing I design is manufactured,

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:45.269
and it has a function:

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.107
to be read, to convey meaning.

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:48.753
But there is a bit more to it than that.

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:50.601
There's the sort of aesthetic element.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.317
What makes these two letters different

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:56.349
from different interpretations by different designers?

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.362
What gives the work of some designers

00:02:58.362 --> 00:03:01.273
sort of characteristic personal style,

00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:03.810
as you might find in the work of a fashion designer,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.885
an automobile designer, whatever?

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.660
There have been some cases, I admit,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.810
where I as a designer

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.899
did feel the influence of technology.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.959
This is from the mid-'60s,

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.194
the change from metal type to photo,

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.896
hot to cold.

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:21.093
This brought some benefits

00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.439
but also one particular drawback:

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.112
a spacing system that only provided

00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:31.095
18 discrete units for letters

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:33.558
to be accommodated on.

00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:35.534
I was asked at this time to design

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:38.272
a series of condensed sans serif types

00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:41.435
with as many different variants as possible

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:45.282
within this 18-unit box.

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:46.921
Quickly looking at the arithmetic,

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:50.230
I realized I could only actually make three

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.617
of related design. Here you see them.

00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:56.208
In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,

00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:00.019
and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.592
really boxed me in.

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.425
It kind of determined the proportions

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:05.714
of the design.

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:09.744
Here are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.

00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:12.436
So do you look at these and say,

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:15.575
"Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.382
and by God it shows in the results."

00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:20.689
I hope not.

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.930
If I were doing this same job today,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.756
instead of having 18 spacing units,

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:28.840
I would have 1,000.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.293
Clearly I could make more variants,

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:35.989
but would these three members
of the family be better?

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:37.841
It's hard to say without actually doing it,

00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:39.548
but they would not be better in the proportion

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:42.637
of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:44.575
My instinct tells you that any improvement

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:47.653
would be rather slight, because they were designed

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:50.574
as functions of the system they were designed to fit,

00:04:50.574 --> 00:04:52.983
and as I said, type is very adaptable.

00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:55.770
It does hide its methods.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.452
All industrial designers work within constraints.

00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:00.944
This is not fine art.

00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:02.822
The question is, does a constraint

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:05.489
force a compromise?

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:07.000
By accepting a constraint,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.449
are you working to a lower standard?

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.411
I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.535
by something that Charles Eames said.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:15.080
He said he was conscious of working

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.118
within constraints,

00:05:16.118 --> 00:05:19.344
but not of making compromises.

00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:21.905
The distinction between a constraint

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.280
and a compromise is obviously very subtle,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.951
but it's very central to my attitude to work.

00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.842
Remember this reading experience?

00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:34.267
The phone book. I'll hold the slide

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:38.802
so you can enjoy the nostalgia.

00:05:38.802 --> 00:05:41.548
This is from the mid-'70s early trials

00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:44.177
of Bell Centennial typeface I designed

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.951
for the U.S. phone books,

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:49.270
and it was my first experience of digital type,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.440
and quite a baptism.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.039
Designed for the phone books, as I said,

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.407
to be printed at tiny size on newsprint

00:05:58.407 --> 00:06:00.725
on very high-speed rotary presses

00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:03.477
with ink that was kerosene and lampblack.

00:06:03.477 --> 00:06:07.318
This is not a hospitable environment

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:10.520
for a typographic designer.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.419
So the challenge for me was to design type

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.920
that performed as well as possible

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.665
in these very adverse production conditions.

00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:21.520
As I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.339
I had to draw every character by hand

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.054
on quadrille graph paper --

00:06:26.054 --> 00:06:28.006
there were four weights of Bell Centennial —

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:31.359
pixel by pixel, then encode
them raster line by raster line

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:32.340
for the keyboard.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.764
It took two years, but I learned a lot.

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.394
These letters look as though they've been chewed

00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:39.838
by the dog or something or other,

00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:41.780
but the missing pixels at the intersections

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.385
of strokes or in the crotches

00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:46.559
are the result of my studying the effects

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:49.505
of ink spread on cheap paper

00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:53.242
and reacting, revising the font accordingly.

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:56.492
These strange artifacts are designed to compensate

00:06:56.492 --> 00:06:59.244
for the undesirable effects of scale

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.530
and production process.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.376
At the outset, AT&amp;T had wanted

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:07.617
to set the phone books in Helvetica,

00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:09.282
but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said

00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.785
in the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:13.820
the letters in Helvetica were designed to be

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.561
as similar to one another as possible.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.835
This is not the recipe for legibility at small size.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:22.425
It looks very elegant up on a slide.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:24.615
I had to disambiguate these forms

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:27.615
of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:29.910
by sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.823
in the bottom part of that slide.

00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:35.480
So now we're on to the mid-'80s,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.036
the early days of digital outline fonts,

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:40.393
vector technology.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:42.431
There was an issue at that time

00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:44.287
with the size of the fonts,

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:47.171
the amount of data that was required to find

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:52.141
and store a font in computer memory.

00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:53.799
It limited the number of fonts you could get

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:56.789
on your typesetting system at any one time.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.938
I did an analysis of the data,

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:03.462
and found that a typical serif face

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:04.921
you see on the left

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:06.937
needed nearly twice as much data

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:09.473
as a sans serif in the middle

00:08:09.473 --> 00:08:11.535
because of all the points required

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:16.043
to define the elegantly curved serif brackets.

00:08:16.043 --> 00:08:19.477
The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,

00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:21.179
they represent the amount of data

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:24.984
needed to store each of the fonts.

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:27.150
So the sans serif, in the middle,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.114
sans the serifs, was much more economical,

00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:32.313
81 to 151.

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:35.970
"Aha," I thought. "The engineers have a problem.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.205
Designer to the rescue."

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.552
I made a serif type, you can see it on the right,

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.499
without curved serifs.

00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:44.915
I made them polygonal, out
of straight line segments,

00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:46.898
chamfered brackets.

00:08:46.898 --> 00:08:51.266
And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:53.565
We call it Charter, on the right.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.535
So I went to the head of engineering

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.993
with my numbers, and I said proudly,

00:08:57.993 --> 00:09:00.121
"I have solved your problem."

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.834
"Oh," he said. "What problem?"

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.480
And I said, "Well, you know, the problem

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.897
of the huge data you require
for serif fonts and so on."

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:12.444
"Oh," he said. "We solved that problem last week.

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:14.600
We wrote a compaction routine that reduces

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.180
the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.168
You can have as many fonts on your system

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:20.726
as you like."

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:23.340
"Well, thank you for letting me know," I said.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.970
Foiled again.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.015
I was left with a design solution

00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:31.488
for a nonexistent technical problem.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.957
But here is where the story sort
of gets interesting for me.

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:36.552
I didn't just throw my design away

00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:37.953
in a fit of pique.

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:39.690
I persevered.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.858
What had started as a technical exercise

00:09:41.858 --> 00:09:45.122
became an aesthetic exercise, really.

00:09:45.122 --> 00:09:48.171
In other words, I had come to like this typeface.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.490
Forget its origins. Screw that.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.980
I liked the design for its own sake.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.363
The simplified forms of Charter

00:09:55.363 --> 00:09:57.446
gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality

00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:58.997
and unfussy spareness

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:01.487
that sort of pleased me.

00:10:01.487 --> 00:10:04.040
You know, at times of technical innovation,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.560
designers want to be influenced

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.296
by what's in the air.

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.527
We want to respond. We want to be pushed

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:12.938
into exploring something new.

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:15.837
So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.

00:10:15.837 --> 00:10:19.627
In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:22.820
between the technology and the design of Charter.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.582
I had really misunderstood the technology.

00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:29.910
The technology did suggest something to me,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.027
but it did not force my hand,

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:34.744
and I think this happens very often.

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:37.370
You know, engineers are very smart,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.926
and despite occasional frustrations

00:10:38.926 --> 00:10:40.453
because I'm less smart,

00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:42.180
I've always enjoyed working with them

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.258
and learning from them.

00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:46.600
Apropos, in the mid-'90s,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.291
I started talking to Microsoft

00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:51.679
about screen fonts.

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:54.100
Up to that point, all the fonts on screen

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.853
had been adapted from previously existing

00:10:56.853 --> 00:10:59.230
printing fonts, of course.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.733
But Microsoft foresaw correctly

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:03.883
the movement, the stampede

00:11:03.883 --> 00:11:06.670
towards electronic communication,

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.700
to reading and writing onscreen

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.833
with the printed output as being sort of secondary

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:14.056
in importance.

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:17.635
So the priorities were just tipping at that point.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.829
They wanted a small core set of fonts

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:23.134
that were not adapted but designed for the screen

00:11:23.134 --> 00:11:25.707
to face up to the problems of screen,

00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:29.549
which were their coarse resolution displays.

00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:33.080
I said to Microsoft, a typeface designed

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.649
for a particular technology

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:38.024
is a self-obsoleting typeface.

00:11:38.024 --> 00:11:40.118
I've designed too many faces in the past

00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:43.697
that were intended to mitigate technical problems.

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:46.532
Thanks to the engineers, the
technical problems went away.

00:11:46.532 --> 00:11:49.021
So did my typeface.

00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.152
It was only a stopgap.

00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:53.693
Microsoft came back to say that

00:11:53.693 --> 00:11:55.323
affordable computer monitors

00:11:55.323 --> 00:11:56.520
with better resolutions

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.116
were at least a decade away.

00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:01.770
So I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.182
that's more than a stopgap.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.183
So I was persuaded, I was convinced,

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.505
and we went to work on what became Verdana

00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:10.177
and Georgia,

00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:12.517
for the first time working not on paper

00:12:12.517 --> 00:12:16.477
but directly onto the screen from the pixel up.

00:12:16.477 --> 00:12:20.330
At that time, screens were binary.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.370
The pixel was either on or it was off.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.225
Here you see the outline of a letter,

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:27.692
the cap H,

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:30.493
which is the thin black line, the contour,

00:12:30.493 --> 00:12:33.369
which is how it is stored in memory,

00:12:33.369 --> 00:12:35.039
superimposed on the bitmap,

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:37.187
which is the grey area,

00:12:37.187 --> 00:12:39.024
which is how it's displayed on the screen.

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:42.170
The bitmap is rasterized from the outline.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.411
Here in a cap H, which is all straight lines,

00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.499
the two are in almost perfect sync

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:50.867
on the Cartesian grid.

00:12:50.867 --> 00:12:53.993
Not so with an O.

00:12:53.993 --> 00:12:56.720
This looks more like bricklaying
than type design,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.621
but believe me, this is a good bitmap O,

00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.636
for the simple reason that it's symmetrical

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:04.116
in both x and y axes.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.974
In a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask

00:13:06.974 --> 00:13:08.694
for more than that.

00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:11.098
I would sometimes make, I don't know,

00:13:11.098 --> 00:13:13.454
three or four different versions of a difficult letter

00:13:13.454 --> 00:13:14.960
like a lowercase A,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.500
and then stand back to choose which was the best.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.595
Well, there was no best,

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:23.020
so the designer's judgment comes in

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.409
in trying to decide

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:27.450
which is the least bad.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.900
Is that a compromise?

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.446
Not to me, if you are working

00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:34.533
at the highest standard the technology will allow,

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.742
although that standard may be

00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:39.221
well short of the ideal.

00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.812
You may be able to see on this slide

00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:42.974
two different bitmap fonts there.

00:13:42.974 --> 00:13:44.670
The "a" in the upper one, I think,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.583
is better than the "a" in the lower one,

00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.159
but it still ain't great.

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:51.066
You can maybe see the effect better

00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:54.442
if it's reduced. Well, maybe not.

00:13:54.442 --> 00:13:56.838
So I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,

00:13:56.838 --> 00:13:58.341
out of necessity.

00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:00.270
For a certain kind of temperament,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.970
there is a certain kind of satisfaction

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.608
in doing something that cannot be perfect

00:14:05.608 --> 00:14:09.477
but can still be done to the best of your ability.

00:14:09.477 --> 00:14:14.334
Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.

00:14:14.334 --> 00:14:16.607
The bitmap looks jagged and rough.

00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:18.466
It is jagged and rough.

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:20.462
But I discovered, by experiment,

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:23.679
that there is an optimum slant

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:25.625
for an italic on a screen

00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:27.957
so the strokes break well

00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:30.440
at the pixel boundaries.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.221
Look in this example how, rough as it is,

00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:35.271
how the left and right legs

00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:37.220
actually break at the same level.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.740
That's a victory. That's good, right there.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.918
And of course, at the lower depths,

00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:45.841
you don't get much choice.

00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:50.886
This is an S, in case you were wondering.

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:53.040
Well, it's been 18 years now

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.690
since Verdana and Georgia were released.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.780
Microsoft were absolutely right,

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.194
it took a good 10 years,

00:15:00.194 --> 00:15:02.474
but screen displays now do have

00:15:02.474 --> 00:15:04.927
improved spatial resolution,

00:15:04.927 --> 00:15:08.399
and very much improved photometric resolution

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:11.553
thanks to anti-aliasing and so on.

00:15:11.553 --> 00:15:15.250
So now that their mission is accomplished,

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.980
has that meant the demise

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.860
of the screen fonts that I designed

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.511
for coarser displays back then?

00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:24.906
Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:27.078
and the flood of new web fonts

00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:28.581
coming on to the market?

00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:30.441
Or have they established their own

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:32.679
sort of evolutionary niche

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.416
that is independent of technology?

00:15:36.416 --> 00:15:38.087
In other words, have they been absorbed

00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:41.400
into the typographic mainstream?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.058
I'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.

00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:47.553
Hey, 18 is a good age for anything

00:15:47.553 --> 00:15:49.704
with present-day rates of attrition,

00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:51.618
so I'm not complaining.

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.457
Thank you.

00:15:54.457 --> 00:15:56.634
(Applause)
