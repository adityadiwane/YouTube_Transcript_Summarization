00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:16.423
So many of you have probably seen
the movie "The Martian."

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.778
But for those of you who did not,
it's a movie about an astronaut

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:25.345
who is stranded on Mars,
and his efforts to stay alive

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.865
until the Earth can send a rescue mission
to bring him back to Earth.

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:34.164
Gladly, they do re-establish communication

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:36.726
with the character,
astronaut Watney, at some point

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.021
so that he's not as alone
on Mars until he can be rescued.

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:45.308
So while you're watching the movie,
or even if you haven't,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:46.880
when you think about Mars,

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.704
you're probably thinking about
how far away it is and how distant.

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.307
And, what might not
have occurred to you is,

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.228
what are the logistics really like
of working on another planet --

00:00:58.252 --> 00:01:00.498
of living on two planets

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:06.356
when there are people on the Earth
and there are rovers or people on Mars?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.538
So think about when you have friends,
families and co-workers

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:13.720
in California, on the West Coast
or in other parts of the world.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.098
When you're trying
to communicate with them,

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.560
one of the things
you probably first think about is:

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.680
wait, what time is it in California?

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:23.299
Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:27.054
So even if you're interacting
with colleagues who are in Europe,

00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:29.120
you're immediately thinking about:

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:36.144
What does it take to coordinate
communication when people are far away?

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:42.377
So we don't have people on Mars
right now, but we do have rovers.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:47.506
And actually right now, on Curiosity,
it is 6:10 in the morning.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.301
So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:52.697
We have four rovers on Mars.

00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:56.728
The United States has put four rovers
on Mars since the mid-1990s,

00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:00.691
and I have been privileged enough
to work on three of them.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:05.236
So, I am a spacecraft engineer,
a spacecraft operations engineer,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.107
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Los Angeles, California.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:14.837
And these rovers
are our robotic emissaries.

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:21.139
So, they are our eyes and our ears,
and they see the planet for us

00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:22.996
until we can send people.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.313
So we learn how to operate
on other planets through these rovers.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:32.643
So before we send people, we send robots.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:37.097
So the reason there's a time difference
on Mars right now,

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:38.423
from the time that we're at

00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:42.421
is because the Martian day
is longer than the Earth day.

00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:45.571
Our Earth day is 24 hours,

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.969
because that's how long it takes
the Earth to rotate,

00:02:48.993 --> 00:02:50.994
how long it takes to go around once.

00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:52.930
So our day is 24 hours.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:03:00.126
It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately
40 minutes to rotate once.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.568
So that means that the Martian day
is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:12.182
So teams of people who are operating
the rovers on Mars, like this one,

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:17.618
what we are doing is we are living
on Earth, but working on Mars.

00:03:17.642 --> 00:03:23.107
So we have to think as if we are actually
on Mars with the rover.

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:27.053
Our job, the job of this team,
of which I'm a part of,

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:33.006
is to send commands to the rover
to tell it what to do the next day.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.059
To tell it to drive or drill
or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.

00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:41.839
So while she's sleeping --
and the rover does sleep at night

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:44.233
because she needs
to recharge her batteries

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:48.153
and she needs to weather
the cold Martian night.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:49.539
And so she sleeps.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:54.331
So while she sleeps, we work
on her program for the next day.

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:57.659
So I work the Martian night shift.

00:03:57.683 --> 00:03:59.274
(Laughter)

00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:05.926
So in order to come to work on the Earth
at the same time every day on Mars --

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.354
like, let's say I need to be
at work at 5:00 p.m.,

00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:13.947
this team needs to be at work
at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,

00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:20.971
then we have to come to work
on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.141
in order to stay in sync with Mars.

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:27.117
That's like moving a time zone every day.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:32.596
So one day you come in at 8:00,
the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.889
the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,

00:04:35.913 --> 00:04:37.502
the next day at 10:00.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:41.104
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,

00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:44.117
until soon you're coming to work
in the middle of the night --

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.958
the middle of the Earth night.

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:49.600
Right? So you can imagine
how confusing that is.

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:51.776
Hence, the Mars watch.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.801
(Laughter)

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.343
This weights in this watch
have been mechanically adjusted

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.895
so that it runs more slowly.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.808
Right? And we didn't start out --

00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:03.058
I got this watch in 2004

00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:06.386
when Spirit and Opportunity,
the rovers back then.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.016
We didn't start out thinking

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.471
that we were going to need Mars watches.

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:14.926
Right? We thought, OK,
we'll just have the time on our computers

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.598
and on the mission control screens,
and that would be enough.

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.003
Yeah, not so much.

00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:22.876
Because we weren't just
working on Mars time,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.059
we were actually living on Mars time.

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:30.366
And we got just instantaneously confused
about what time it was.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.183
So you really needed something
on your wrist to tell you:

00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:37.498
What time is it on the Earth?
What time is it on Mars?

00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:43.821
And it wasn't just the time on Mars
that was confusing;

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:48.614
we also needed to be able
to talk to each other about it.

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:54.784
So a "sol" is a Martian day --
again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.

00:05:54.808 --> 00:05:58.003
So when we're talking about something
that's happening on the Earth,

00:05:58.027 --> 00:05:59.336
we will say, today.

00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:02.880
So, for Mars, we say, "tosol."

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.742
(Laughter)

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:10.329
Yesterday became "yestersol" for Mars.

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:15.164
Again, we didn't start out thinking,
"Oh, let's invent a language."

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:16.478
It was just very confusing.

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:18.683
I remember somebody
walked up to me and said,

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:22.140
"I would like to do this activity
on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:27.275
And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow,
or Mars, tomorrow?"

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:32.859
We started this terminology because
we needed a way to talk to each other.

00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:34.011
(Laughter)

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:38.311
Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:42.651
Because people have different preferences
for the words they use.

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:46.051
Some of you might say "soda"
and some of you might say "pop."

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.855
So we have people who say
"nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:55.106
And then something that I noticed after
a few years of working on these missions,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.782
was that the people who work
on the rovers, we say "tosol."

00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:03.780
The people who work on the
landed missions that don't rove around,

00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:05.276
they say "tosoul."

00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:10.497
So I could actually tell what mission
you worked on from your Martian accent.

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:13.771
(Laughter)

00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:17.655
So we have the watches and the language,
and you're detecting a theme here, right?

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:19.675
So that we don't get confused.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:24.046
But even the Earth daylight
could confuse us.

00:07:24.489 --> 00:07:26.828
If you think that right now,
you've come to work

00:07:26.852 --> 00:07:28.947
and it's the middle of the Martian night

00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.269
and there's light streaming in
from the windows

00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:34.441
that's going to be confusing as well.

00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.406
So you can see from
this image of the control room

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.699
that all of the blinds are down.

00:07:39.723 --> 00:07:42.726
So that there's no light to distract us.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.102
The blinds went down all over the building
about a week before landing,

00:07:47.126 --> 00:07:50.393
and they didn't go up
until we went off Mars time.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:54.028
So this also works
for the house, for at home.

00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:56.825
I've been on Mars time three times,
and my husband is like,

00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:58.664
OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.

00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:04.890
And so he'll put foil all over the windows
and dark curtains and shades

00:08:04.914 --> 00:08:08.061
because it also affects your families.

00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:12.964
And so here I was living in kind of
this darkened environment, but so was he.

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:14.821
And he'd gotten used to it.

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:18.487
But then I would get these plaintive
emails from him when he was at work.

00:08:19.077 --> 00:08:22.369
Should I come home? Are you awake?

00:08:22.393 --> 00:08:25.523
What time is it on Mars?

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.045
And I decided, OK,
so he needs a Mars watch.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:29.604
(Laughter)

00:08:29.628 --> 00:08:34.062
But of course, it's 2016,
so there's an app for that.

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:35.364
(Laughter)

00:08:35.388 --> 00:08:40.002
So now instead of the watches,
we can also use our phones.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.560
But the impact on families
was just across the board;

00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:48.246
it wasn't just those of us
who were working on the rovers

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.484
but our families as well.

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.987
This is David Oh,
one of our flight directors,

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:57.485
and he's at the beach in Los Angeles
with his family at 1:00 in the morning.

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:58.932
(Laughter)

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.936
So because we landed in August

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.406
and his kids didn't have to go back
to school until September,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.178
they actually went on to Mars time
with him for one month.

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:15.971
They got up 40 minutes later every day.

00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:18.178
And they were on dad's work schedule.

00:09:18.202 --> 00:09:22.177
So they lived on Mars time for a month
and had these great adventures,

00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.298
like going bowling
in the middle of the night

00:09:24.322 --> 00:09:25.640
or going to the beach.

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:29.328
And one of the things
that we all discovered

00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:33.340
is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:36.917
at 3:00 in the morning
when there's no traffic.

00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:38.415
(Laughter)

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:39.631
So we would get off work,

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:42.770
and we didn't want to go home
and bother our families,

00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:45.984
and we were hungry, so instead of
going locally to eat something,

00:09:46.008 --> 00:09:49.572
we'd go, "Wait, there's this great
all-night deli in Long Beach,

00:09:49.596 --> 00:09:51.838
and we can get there in 10 minutes!"

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.583
So we would drive down --
it was like the 60s, no traffic.

00:09:54.607 --> 00:09:58.362
We would drive down there,
and the restaurant owners would go,

00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:00.548
"Who are you people?

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:05.414
And why are you at my restaurant
at 3:00 in the morning?"

00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:10.668
So they came to realize
that there were these packs of Martians,

00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:16.146
roaming the LA freeways,
in the middle of the night --

00:10:17.108 --> 00:10:19.131
in the middle of the Earth night.

00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:23.952
And we did actually
start calling ourselves Martians.

00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:30.007
So those of us who were on Mars time
would refer to ourselves as Martians,

00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:32.884
and everyone else as Earthlings.

00:10:32.908 --> 00:10:34.208
(Laughter)

00:10:34.232 --> 00:10:39.927
And that's because when you're moving
a time-zone every day,

00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:45.764
you start to really feel separated
from everyone else.

00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:49.707
You're literally in your own world.

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:57.449
So I have this button on that says,
"I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."

00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:00.218
And there's a picture of it
up on the screen.

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:05.871
So the reason we got these buttons
is because we work on Mars time

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:10.944
in order to be as efficient as possible
with the rover on Mars,

00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:13.258
to make the best use of our time.

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:17.168
But we don't stay on Mars time
for more than three to four months.

00:11:17.192 --> 00:11:21.460
Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars
time, which is what we're working now.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:26.856
And that's because it's hard on
your bodies, it's hard on your families.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.762
In fact, there were sleep researchers
who actually were studying us

00:11:31.786 --> 00:11:36.823
because it was so unusual for humans
to try to extend their day.

00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:38.437
And they had about 30 of us

00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:42.087
that they would do
sleep deprivation experiments on.

00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:45.674
So I would come in and take the test
and I fell asleep in each one.

00:11:45.698 --> 00:11:52.340
And that was because, again,
this eventually becomes hard on your body.

00:11:52.364 --> 00:11:55.679
Even though it was a blast.

00:11:55.703 --> 00:12:00.217
It was a huge bonding experience
with the other members on the team,

00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:03.081
but it is difficult to sustain.

00:12:04.063 --> 00:12:10.248
So these rover missions are our first
steps out into the solar system.

00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:15.345
We are learning how to live
on more than one planet.

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:20.445
We are changing our perspective
to become multi-planetary.

00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:23.558
So the next time you see
a Star Wars movie,

00:12:23.582 --> 00:12:27.257
and there are people going
from the Dagobah system to Tatooine,

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:32.771
think about what it really means to have
people spread out so far.

00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:35.857
What it means in terms
of the distances between them,

00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.701
how they will start to feel
separate from each other

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:42.949
and just the logistics of the time.

00:12:43.757 --> 00:12:48.309
We have not sent people
to Mars yet, but we hope to.

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:52.172
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:55.685
and all of the international
space agencies of the world,

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:59.476
we hope to do that
in the next few decades.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.325
So soon we will have people on Mars,
and we truly will be multi-planetary.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.232
And the young boy or the young girl

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:15.256
who will be going to Mars could be
in this audience or listening today.

00:13:16.021 --> 00:13:21.623
I have wanted to work at JPL
on these missions since I was 14 years old

00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:23.869
and I am privileged to be a part of it.

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:27.947
And this is a remarkable time
in the space program,

00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.145
and we are all in this journey together.

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:36.380
So the next time you think
you don't have enough time in your day,

00:13:36.404 --> 00:13:41.182
just remember, it's all a matter
of your Earthly perspective.

00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:42.357
Thank you.

00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:46.495
(Applause)
