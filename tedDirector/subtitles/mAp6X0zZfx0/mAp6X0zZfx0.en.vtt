00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Can you tell everybody your name?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Einstein: Einstein.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
E: Hello.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160
E: Hi, sweetheart.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
E: Woo.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
SW: Yeah.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
(Laughter)

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
all the exciting speakers here for the conference.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
E: [Squawks]

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
SW: Yeah.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
(Laughter)

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
E: Achoo!

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
SW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her research

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
could help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Einstein: [Coughs]

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
SW: Yeah.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160
(Laughter)

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
in his research at the microscopic level.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
(Laughter)

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
she's very interested in things that fly.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160
E: Ooh.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
E: [Spaceship noise]

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160
SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
E: [Laser noise]

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
(Laughter)

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
It would be very dangerous if you fell down.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160
SW: Yeah.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
(Laughter)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160
Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160
E: Ow, ow, ow.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160
E: [Squawks]

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
E: [Squawks]

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
educating the public, she loves to take in the arts.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Can you get down?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160
E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
SW: Do your head now.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
(Laughter)

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
E: [Operatic squawk]

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160
SW: Very good.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
(Laughter)

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Einstein, can you also sing?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
E: La, la.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
E: [Squawks]

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
E: What's the matter?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
You were saying that you were really embarrassed,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
because you're in love with a pirate?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160
E: Yar.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160
E: Beer.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160
You like to drink water.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160
E: [Water sound]

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
and she's pretty nervous to meet him.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
What do you say to a good-looking man?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160
E: Hey, baby.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
(Laughter)

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
E: Yee haw.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
(Laughter)

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
SW: And since she's such a big fan,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
SW: Again.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160
SW: Again.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160
SW: Big finish.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
SW: Good job!

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160
(Applause)

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
E: Woo, woo, woo.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
SW: What about the other birds?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
SW: And the penguin?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160
E: Quack, quack, quack.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
SW: There we go.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
(Laughter)

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
SW: Very good.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160
(Laughter)

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160
What about a wolf?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160
E: Ooooowww.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
SW: And a pig?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
E: Oink, oink, oink.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
SW: And the rooster?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
SW: And how about those cats?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
E: Meow.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
(Laughter)

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160
E: Grrrrr.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160
(Laughter)

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
SW: What about a skunk?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
E: Stinker.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160
(Laughter)

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
E: Superstar.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
(Laughter)

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
to help protect their homes that they live [in].

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Why do we want to protect your home?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160
E: I'm special.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
SW: You are very special. What would you like to say

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160
to all these nice people?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
E: I love you.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
E: [Kissing noise]

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160
SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.160
E: Goodbye.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
SW: Good job. Thank you all.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
(Applause)
