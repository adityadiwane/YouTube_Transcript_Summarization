00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
One thing the world needs,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
one thing this country desperately needs

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
is a better way

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of conducting our political debates.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We need to rediscover

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the lost art of democratic argument.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.260
(Applause)

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
If you think about the arguments we have,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
most of the time it's shouting matches

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
on cable television,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I have a suggestion.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Look at all the arguments we have these days

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
over health care,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
over the gap between rich and poor,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Lying just beneath the surface

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of those arguments,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
with passions raging on all sides,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
are big questions

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
of moral philosophy,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
big questions of justice.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But we too rarely

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
articulate and defend

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and argue about

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
those big moral questions in our politics.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
So what I would like to do today

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
is have something of a discussion.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
First, let me take

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
a famous philosopher

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
who wrote about those questions

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
of justice and morality,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
give you a very short lecture

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
on Aristotle of ancient Athens,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Aristotle's theory of justice,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and then have a discussion here

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
to see whether Aristotle's ideas

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
actually inform

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
the way we think and argue

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
about questions today.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So, are you ready for the lecture?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
According to Aristotle,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
justice means giving people what they deserve.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
That's it; that's the lecture.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
(Laughter)

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The real questions begin

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
when it comes to arguing about

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
who deserves what and why.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Take the example of flutes.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Suppose we're distributing flutes.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Who should get the best ones?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Let's see what people --

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
What would you say?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Who should get the best flute?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You can just call it out.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
(Audience: Random.)

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Michael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Who else?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Audience: The best flute players.)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
MS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
MS: The worst flute players.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
How many say the best flute players?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Why?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Laughter)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
But here's a harder question.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Why do you think,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
those of you who voted this way,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Peter: The greatest benefit to all.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
MS: The greatest benefit to all.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
We'll hear better music

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
MS: All right.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Well, it's a good reason.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We'll all be better off if good music is played

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
rather than terrible music.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But Peter,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
That's all right.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Aristotle had a different reason

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
He said,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that's what flutes are for --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
to be played well.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
He says that to reason about

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
just distribution of a thing,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
we have to reason about,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and sometimes argue about,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
the purpose of the thing,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
or the social activity --

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
in this case, musical performance.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And the point, the essential nature,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
of musical performance

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
is to produce excellent music.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It'll be a happy byproduct

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that we'll all benefit.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
But when we think about justice,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Aristotle says,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
what we really need to think about

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
is the essential nature of the activity in question

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and the qualities that are worth

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
honoring and admiring and recognizing.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
One of the reasons

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
that the best flute players should get the best flutes

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
is that musical performance

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is not only to make the rest of us happy,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
but to honor

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and recognize

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
the excellence

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
of the best musicians.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
may seem a trivial case.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Let's take a contemporary example

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
of the dispute about justice.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
It had to do with golf.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Casey Martin -- a few years ago,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Casey Martin --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
did any of you hear about him?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
He was a very good golfer,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
but he had a disability.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that made it very painful

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
for him to walk the course.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
In fact, it carried risk of injury.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
He asked the PGA,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the Professional Golfers' Association,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
for permission to use a golf cart

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
in the PGA tournaments.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
They said, "No.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Now that would give you an unfair advantage."

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
He sued,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and his case went all the way

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
the case over the golf cart,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
because the law says

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that the disabled

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
must be accommodated,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
provided the accommodation does not

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
change the essential nature

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
of the activity.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
He says, "I'm a great golfer.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I want to compete.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
But I need a golf cart

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
to get from one hole to the next."

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Suppose you were

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
on the Supreme Court.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Suppose you were deciding

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
the justice of this case.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
How many here would say

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And how many say, no, he doesn't?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
All right, we have a good division of opinion here.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Someone who would not

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
what would be your reason?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
What would be your reason?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
MS: It would be an unfair advantage

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
if he gets to ride in a golf cart.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
All right, those of you,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
worry about an unfair advantage.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
What about those of you who say

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
he should be given a golf cart?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
How would you answer the objection?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Yes, all right.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Audience: The cart's not part of the game.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
MS: Charlie says --

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Tell us, Charlie,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Charlie: The cart's not part of the game.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
MS: But what about walking from hole to hole?

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
MS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
(Laughter)

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Who has an answer for Charlie?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
All right, who has an answer for Charlie?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
What would you say?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
walking all those holes.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
MS: Walking all those holes?

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
MS: Warren.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Charlie, what do you say to Warren?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Charley: I'll stick to my original thesis.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.260
(Laughter)

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
MS: Warren, are you a golfer?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Warren: I am not a golfer.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
(Laughter)

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260
(Applause)

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
You know,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
it's interesting.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
In the case, in the lower court,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
they brought in golfing greats

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
to testify on this very issue.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Is walking the course essential to the game?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And what do you suppose they all said?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Yes. They agreed with Warren.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
They said, yes, walking the course

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
is strenuous physical exercise.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And so it would change

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
the fundamental nature of the game

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
to give him the golf cart.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Now, notice,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
something interesting --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
The Supreme Court

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
decided.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
What do you suppose they said?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
They said yes,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Seven to two, they ruled.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
What was interesting about their ruling

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and about the discussion we've just had

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
is that the discussion about

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
the right, the justice, of the matter

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
depended on

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
figuring out what is

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
the essential nature of golf.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
And the Supreme Court justices

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
wrestled with that question.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
said he had read all about the history of golf,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and the essential point of the game

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
is to get very small ball from one place

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
into a hole

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
in as few strokes as possible,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
and that walking was not essential, but incidental.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Now, there were two dissenters,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
one of whom was Justice Scalia.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
He wouldn't have granted the cart,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and he had a very interesting dissent.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
It's interesting because

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
he rejected the Aristotelian premise

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
underlying the majority's opinion.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
He said it's not possible

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
to determine the essential nature

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
of a game like golf.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Here's how he put it.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
"To say that something is essential

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
is ordinarily to say that it is necessary

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
to the achievement of a certain object.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
But since it is the very nature of a game

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
to have no object except amusement,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
(Laughter)

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
that is, what distinguishes games

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
from productive activity,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
(Laughter)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
it is quite impossible to say

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
that any of a game's arbitrary rules

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
is essential."

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So there you have Justice Scalia

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
taking on the Aristotelian premise

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
of the majority's opinion.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Justice Scalia's opinion

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
is questionable

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
for two reasons.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
First, no real sports fan would talk that way.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
(Laughter)

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
If we had thought that the rules

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
of the sports we care about

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
are merely arbitrary,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
rather than designed to call forth

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the virtues and the excellences

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
that we think are worthy of admiring,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
It's also objectionable

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
on a second ground.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
On the face of it,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
an argument about fairness,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
what's an unfair advantage.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
But if fairness were the only thing at stake,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
there would have been an easy and obvious solution.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Let everyone ride in a golf cart

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
if they want to.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Then the fairness objection goes away.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
But letting everyone ride in a cart

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
would have been, I suspect,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
more anathema

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
to the golfing greats

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and to the PGA,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
even than making an exception for Casey Martin.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Why?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Because what was at stake

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
in the dispute over the golf cart

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
was not only the essential nature of golf,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but, relatedly, the question:

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
What abilities

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
are worthy

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
of honor and recognition

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
as athletic talents?

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Let me put the point

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
as delicately as possible:

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Golfers are a little sensitive

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
about the athletic status of their game.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.260
(Laughter)

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
After all, there's no running or jumping,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and the ball stands still.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
(Laughter)

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
So if golfing is the kind of game

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
it would be hard to confer

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
on the golfing greats

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
the status that we confer,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
the honor and recognition

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
that goes to truly great athletes.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
That illustrates

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
that with golf,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
as with flutes,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
it's hard to decide the question

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
of what justice requires,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
without grappling with the question,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
"What is the essential nature

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
of the activity in question,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and what qualities,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
what excellences

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
connected with that activity,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
are worthy of honor and recognition?"

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Let's take a final example

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that's prominent in contemporary political debate:

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
same-sex marriage.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
There are those who favor state recognition

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
only of traditional marriage

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
between one man and one woman,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and there are those who favor state recognition

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
of same-sex marriage.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
How many here

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
favor the first policy:

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
the state should recognize traditional marriage only?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Now, put it this way:

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
What ways of thinking

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
about justice and morality

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
underlie the arguments we have

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
over marriage?

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
The opponents of same-sex marriage say

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
that the purpose of marriage,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
fundamentally, is procreation,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
and that's what's worthy of honoring

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
and recognizing and encouraging.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
That's really what marriage is about.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
So with flutes, with golf carts,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and even with a fiercely contested question

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
like same-sex marriage,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Aristotle has a point.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Very hard to argue about justice

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
without first arguing

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
about the purpose of social institutions

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and about what qualities are worthy

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
of honor and recognition.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
So let's step back from these cases

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and see how they shed light

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
on the way we might improve, elevate,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
the terms of political discourse

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
in the United States,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and for that matter, around the world.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
There is a tendency to think

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
that if we engage too directly

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
with moral questions in politics,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
that's a recipe for disagreement,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and for that matter, a recipe for

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
intolerance and coercion.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
So better to shy away from,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to ignore,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
the moral and the religious convictions

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
that people bring to civic life.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
It seems to me that our discussion

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
reflects the opposite,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
that a better way

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
to mutual respect

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
is to engage directly

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
with the moral convictions

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
citizens bring to public life,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
rather than to require

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
that people leave their deepest moral convictions

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
outside politics

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
before they enter.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
That, it seems to me, is a way

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
to begin to restore

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
the art of democratic argument.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
(Applause)

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
Thank you.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
(Applause)

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Thank you.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
(Applause)

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
Thanks. Thank you.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Chris.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Thanks, Chris.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
to same-sex marriage --

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
that was a genius link.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
What's your vision for the next phase of this?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
MS: Well, I think that it is possible.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
In the classroom, we have arguments

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
on some of the most fiercely held

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
moral convictions that students have

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
about big public questions.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
And I think we can do that in public life more generally.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
And so my real dream would be

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
to take the public television series

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
that we've created of the course --

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
it's available now, online,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
free for everyone anywhere in the world --

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
and to see whether we can partner with institutions,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
at universities in China, in India,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
in Africa, around the world,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
to try to promote

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
civic education

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
and also a richer kind

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
of democratic debate.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
CA: So you picture, at some point,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
live, in real time,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
but with people from China and India joining in?

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
with 1,500 people in Long Beach,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
and we do it in a classroom at Harvard

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
with about 1,000 students.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
Wouldn't it be interesting

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
to take this way

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
of thinking and arguing,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.260
engaging seriously with big moral questions,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
exploring cultural differences

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
and connect through a live video hookup,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
students in Beijing and Mumbai

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
and in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
and create a global classroom.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
That's what I would love to do.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.260
(Applause)

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
CA: So, I would imagine

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.260
that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)
