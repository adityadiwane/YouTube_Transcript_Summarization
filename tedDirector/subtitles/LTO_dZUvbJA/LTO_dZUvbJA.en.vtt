00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.571
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.571
two million years seems
like a really long time.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:34.041
But evolutionarily,
two million years is nothing.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.018
And yet in two million years,

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.797
the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass,

00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:44.030
going from the one-and-a-quarter pound
brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.816
to the almost three-pound meatloaf

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.982
that everybody here
has between their ears.

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:52.907
What is it about a big brain

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:56.688
that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one?

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.947
Well, it turns out when
brains triple in size,

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.486
they don't just get three times bigger;
they gain new structures.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.396
And one of the main reasons our brain got
so big is because it got a new part,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.752
called the "frontal lobe."

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:11.404
Particularly, a part called
the "pre-frontal cortex."

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:15.336
What does a pre-frontal cortex
do for you that should justify

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.940
the entire architectural overhaul
of the human skull

00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:20.727
in the blink of evolutionary time?

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.767
It turns out the pre-frontal
cortex does lots of things,

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:29.681
but one of the most important things
it does is an experience simulator.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.033
Pilots practice in flight simulators

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.612
so that they don't make
real mistakes in planes.

00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:37.593
Human beings have this
marvelous adaptation

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:41.362
that they can actually have
experiences in their heads

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:43.577
before they try them out in real life.

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.124
This is a trick that none
of our ancestors could do,

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:49.389
and that no other animal
can do quite like we can.

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:50.943
It's a marvelous adaptation.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.834
It's up there with opposable thumbs
and standing upright and language

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:58.278
as one of the things that got
our species out of the trees

00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:00.455
and into the shopping mall.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.391
(Laughter)

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:03.695
All of you have done this.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.552
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have
liver-and-onion ice cream,

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:10.984
and it's not because they whipped
some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.030
It's because, without
leaving your armchair,

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:18.461
you can simulate that flavor
and say "yuck" before you make it.

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:23.224
Let's see how your experience
simulators are working.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:25.087
Let's just run a quick diagnostic

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.249
before I proceed
with the rest of the talk.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.988
Here's two different futures
that I invite you to contemplate.

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:35.038
You can try to simulate them and tell me
which one you think you might prefer.

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:40.596
One of them is winning the lottery.
This is about 314 million dollars.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.500
And the other is becoming paraplegic.

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:44.542
(Laughter)

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:46.194
Just give it a moment of thought.

00:02:46.218 --> 00:02:49.029
You probably don't feel
like you need a moment of thought.

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:53.171
Interestingly, there are data
on these two groups of people,

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:55.173
data on how happy they are.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:57.891
And this is exactly
what you expected, isn't it?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.014
But these aren't the data.
I made these up!

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.228
These are the data.

00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:06.210
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly
five minutes into the lecture.

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:10.406
Because the fact is that a year
after losing the use of their legs,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.157
and a year after winning the lotto,
lottery winners and paraplegics

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.734
are equally happy with their lives.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:20.812
Don't feel too bad
about failing the first pop quiz,

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:24.463
because everybody fails
all of the pop quizzes all of the time.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.184
The research that my laboratory
has been doing,

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:30.541
that economists and psychologists
around the country have been doing,

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:33.361
has revealed something
really quite startling to us,

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:35.230
something we call the "impact bias,"

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:38.423
which is the tendency
for the simulator to work badly.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:42.994
For the simulator to make you
believe that different outcomes

00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:45.377
are more different
than in fact they really are.

00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.684
From field studies to laboratory studies,

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:52.447
we see that winning or losing an election,
gaining or losing a romantic partner,

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:56.298
getting or not getting a promotion,
passing or not passing a college test,

00:03:56.322 --> 00:04:02.220
on and on, have far less impact,
less intensity and much less duration

00:04:02.244 --> 00:04:04.710
than people expect them to have.

00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:11.061
This almost floors me --

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:15.571
a recent study showing
how major life traumas affect people

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:18.571
suggests that if it happened
over three months ago,

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.157
with only a few exceptions,

00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:22.939
it has no impact whatsoever
on your happiness.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:25.948
Why?

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:30.121
Because happiness can be synthesized.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:34.431
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,
"I am the happiest man alive.

00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:39.571
I have that in me that can convert poverty
to riches, adversity to prosperity.

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:44.541
I am more invulnerable than Achilles;
fortune hath not one place to hit me."

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.754
What kind of remarkable machinery
does this guy have in his head?

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:52.723
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same
remarkable machinery that all off us have.

00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:55.639
Human beings have something

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:58.904
that we might think of
as a "psychological immune system."

00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:03.921
A system of cognitive processes, largely
non-conscious cognitive processes,

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:07.379
that help them change
their views of the world,

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:08.800
so that they can feel better

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:11.752
about the worlds
in which they find themselves.

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.642
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:17.571
Unlike Sir Thomas,
you seem not to know it.

00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:23.571
We synthesize happiness, but we think
happiness is a thing to be found.

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:25.269
Now, you don't need me to give you

00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:29.381
too many examples of people
synthesizing happiness, I suspect.

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:32.029
Though I'm going to show
you some experimental evidence,

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:34.197
you don't have to look
very far for evidence.

00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:35.892
I took a copy of the New York Times

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:39.100
and tried to find some instances
of people synthesizing happiness.

00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:41.137
Here are three guys
synthesizing happiness.

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.842
"I'm better off physically,
financially, mentally ...

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:46.915
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience."

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.870
"I believe it turned out for the best."

00:05:48.894 --> 00:05:51.143
Who are these characters
who are so damn happy?

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:52.537
The first one is Jim Wright.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.432
Some of you are old enough to remember:

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:56.919
he was the chairman
of the House of Representatives

00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:58.315
and he resigned in disgrace

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.494
when this young Republican
named Newt Gingrich

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:02.662
found out about a shady
book deal he had done.

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:03.928
He lost everything.

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:06.730
The most powerful Democrat
in the country lost everything.

00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:08.550
He lost his money, he lost his power.

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:10.862
What does he have to say
all these years later?

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:13.625
"I am so much better off physically,
financially, mentally

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.450
and in almost every other way."

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.713
What other way would there
be to be better off?

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:19.565
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.303
He's pretty much covered them there.

00:06:22.327 --> 00:06:24.808
Moreese Bickham is somebody
you've never heard of.

00:06:24.832 --> 00:06:27.512
Moreese Bickham uttered
these words upon being released.

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:28.845
He was 78 years old.

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.792
He'd spent 37 years
in a Louisiana State Penitentiary

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:33.300
for a crime he didn't commit.

00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:35.157
[He was ultimately released

00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:37.450
for good behavior
halfway through his sentence.]

00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:39.450
What did he say about his experience?

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:43.032
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience." Glorious!

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.306
He is not saying,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.726
"Well, there were some nice guys.
They had a gym."

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.901
"Glorious,"

00:06:47.925 --> 00:06:51.203
a word we usually reserve for something
like a religious experience.

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:54.956
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words,
and he's somebody you might have known

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.589
but didn't, because in 1949
he read a little article in the paper

00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:01.579
about a hamburger stand owned
by two brothers named McDonalds.

00:07:01.603 --> 00:07:03.834
And he thought,
"That's a really neat idea!"

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:05.540
So he went to find them. They said,

00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:08.109
"We can give you a franchise
on this for 3,000 bucks."

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:11.373
Harry went back to New York,
asked his brother, an investment banker,

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:14.305
to loan him the $3,000,
and his brother's immortal words were,

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.047
"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:17.560
He wouldn't lend him the money,

00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:20.798
and of course, six months later
Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

00:07:20.822 --> 00:07:23.016
It turns out people do eat hamburgers,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.174
and Ray Kroc, for a while,
became the richest man in America.

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:28.022
And then, finally,

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:31.506
some of you recognize
this young photo of Pete Best,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.673
who was the original
drummer for the Beatles,

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:37.522
until they, you know, sent him
out on an errand and snuck away

00:07:37.546 --> 00:07:39.506
and picked up Ringo on a tour.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.826
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best
was interviewed --

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.886
yes, he's still a drummer;
yes, he's a studio musician --

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.417
he had this to say: "I'm happier
than I would have been with the Beatles."

00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:51.573
Okay. There's something important
to be learned from these people,

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:53.472
and it is the secret of happiness.

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:55.869
Here it is, finally to be revealed.

00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:59.115
First: accrue wealth, power,
and prestige, then lose it.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.791
(Laughter)

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.573
Second: spend as much of your life
in prison as you possibly can.

00:08:05.597 --> 00:08:06.598
(Laughter)

00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:09.852
Third: make somebody else
really, really rich.

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:12.599
And finally: never ever join the Beatles.

00:08:12.623 --> 00:08:13.647
(Laughter)

00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:14.822
Yeah, right.

00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:16.932
Because when people synthesize happiness,

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:19.150
as these gentlemen seem to have done,

00:08:19.174 --> 00:08:22.953
we all smile at them,
but we kind of roll our eyes and say,

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:25.513
"Yeah right, you never
really wanted the job."

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:29.513
"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have
that much in common with her,

00:08:29.537 --> 00:08:31.633
and you figured that out just
about the time

00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:33.753
she threw the engagement
ring in your face."

00:08:33.777 --> 00:08:37.513
We smirk because we believe
that synthetic happiness

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:41.013
is not of the same quality
as what we might call "natural happiness."

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:42.489
What are these terms?

00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:45.917
Natural happiness is what we get
when we get what we wanted,

00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:50.845
and synthetic happiness is what we make
when we don't get what we wanted.

00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.845
And in our society,
we have a strong belief

00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:56.845
that synthetic happiness
is of an inferior kind.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.392
Why do we have that belief?

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.574
Well, it's very simple.

00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:04.391
What kind of economic engine
would keep churning

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:07.351
if we believed
that not getting what we want

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.891
could make us just as happy as getting it?

00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:13.947
With all apologies
to my friend Matthieu Ricard,

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:16.173
a shopping mall full of Zen monks

00:09:16.197 --> 00:09:18.311
is not going to be
particularly profitable,

00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:20.937
because they don't want stuff enough.

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:22.042
(Laughter)

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:25.163
I want to suggest to you
that synthetic happiness

00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:27.392
is every bit as real and enduring

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:30.067
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon

00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.654
when you get exactly
what you were aiming for.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.454
I'm a scientist, so I'm going
to do this not with rhetoric,

00:09:35.478 --> 00:09:37.629
but by marinating you
in a little bit of data.

00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:40.599
Let me first show you an experimental
paradigm that is used

00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:44.805
to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness
among regular old folks.

00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:45.987
And this isn't mine.

00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:48.987
It's a 50-year-old paradigm
called the "free choice paradigm."

00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:50.392
It's very simple.

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:53.122
You bring in, say, six objects,

00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:56.407
and you ask a subject to rank them
from the most to the least liked.

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.989
In this case, because
this experiment uses them,

00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:00.392
these are Monet prints.

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:02.392
So, everybody can rank these Monet prints

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:05.417
from the one they like the most,
to the one they like the least.

00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:07.131
Now we give you a choice:

00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:09.557
"We happen to have
some extra prints in the closet.

00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:12.202
We're going to give you
one as your prize to take home.

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:16.058
We happen to have number three
and number four," we tell the subject.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.980
This is a bit of a difficult choice,

00:10:18.004 --> 00:10:20.606
because neither one is preferred
strongly to the other,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.250
but naturally, people
tend to pick number three

00:10:23.274 --> 00:10:25.852
because they liked it
a little better than number four.

00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:30.284
Sometime later -- it could be
15 minutes; it could be 15 days --

00:10:30.308 --> 00:10:32.392
the same stimuli are put
before the subject,

00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:35.121
and the subject is asked
to re-rank the stimuli.

00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.122
"Tell us how much you like them now."

00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:38.353
What happens?

00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:40.346
Watch as happiness is synthesized.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.392
This is the result that has
been replicated over and over again.

00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:45.407
You're watching happiness be synthesized.

00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:46.923
Would you like to see it again?

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.392
Happiness!

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.655
"The one I got is really
better than I thought!

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:53.392
That other one I didn't get sucks!"

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.559
That's the synthesis of happiness.

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:56.620
(Laughter)

00:10:56.644 --> 00:10:59.693
Now, what's the right response to that?

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:01.391
"Yeah, right!"

00:11:02.334 --> 00:11:04.392
Now, here's the experiment we did,

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.331
and I hope this is going to convince you

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:08.632
that "Yeah, right!"
was not the right response.

00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:10.878
We did this experiment
with a group of patients

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:12.299
who had anterograde amnesia.

00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:13.982
These are hospitalized patients.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.171
Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,

00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:18.195
a polyneuritic psychosis.

00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:22.392
They drank way too much,
and they can't make new memories.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:26.329
OK? They remember their childhood,
but if you walk in and introduce yourself,

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.546
and then leave the room,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.824
when you come back,
they don't know who you are.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:33.677
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.

00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:37.392
And we asked these patients to rank them

00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:40.512
from the one they liked
the most to the one they liked the least.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:44.392
We then gave them the choice
between number three and number four.

00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.392
Like everybody else, they said,

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:49.083
"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great!
I could use a new print.

00:11:49.107 --> 00:11:50.392
I'll take number three."

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.392
We explained we would have
number three mailed to them.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:57.392
We gathered up our materials
and we went out of the room,

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:58.779
and counted to a half hour.

00:11:58.803 --> 00:11:59.804
(Laughter)

00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:03.312
Back into the room,
we say, "Hi, we're back."

00:12:03.336 --> 00:12:06.392
The patients, bless them,
say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:09.153
I've got a memory problem;
that's why I'm here.

00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:11.178
If I've met you before, I don't remember."

00:12:11.202 --> 00:12:14.394
"Really, you don't remember?
I was just here with the Monet prints?"

00:12:14.418 --> 00:12:17.012
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.654
"No problem, Jim. All I want
you to do is rank these for me

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:24.488
from the one you like the most
to the one you like the least."

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:25.949
What do they do?

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:28.879
Well, let's first check and make sure
they're really amnesiac.

00:12:28.903 --> 00:12:32.893
We ask these amnesiac patients
to tell us which one they own,

00:12:32.917 --> 00:12:36.215
which one they chose last
time, which one is theirs.

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:39.392
And what we find is amnesiac
patients just guess.

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:42.052
These are normal controls,
where if I did this with you,

00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:44.179
all of you would know
which print you chose.

00:12:44.203 --> 00:12:48.007
But if I do this with amnesiac patients,
they don't have a clue.

00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:50.483
They can't pick
their print out of a lineup.

00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:55.392
Here's what normal controls do:
they synthesize happiness.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.975
Right? This is the change in liking score,

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:01.506
the change from the first time they ranked
to the second time they ranked.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.209
Normal controls show --
that was the magic I showed you;

00:13:04.233 --> 00:13:06.392
now I'm showing it to you
in graphical form --

00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:08.553
"The one I own is better than I thought.

00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:10.942
The one I didn't own,
the one I left behind,

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.663
is not as good as I thought."

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.003
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.
Think about this result.

00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:20.837
These people like better the one they own,

00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:23.106
but they don't know they own it.

00:13:24.526 --> 00:13:28.296
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!

00:13:28.885 --> 00:13:32.067
What these people did
when they synthesized happiness

00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:34.726
is they really, truly changed

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.217
their affective, hedonic, aesthetic
reactions to that poster.

00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:42.392
They're not just saying it
because they own it,

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:44.781
because they don't know they own it.

00:13:45.688 --> 00:13:48.315
When psychologists show you bars,

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:51.894
you know that they are showing
you averages of lots of people.

00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:55.227
And yet, all of us have this
psychological immune system,

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.725
this capacity to synthesize happiness,

00:13:57.749 --> 00:14:00.900
but some of us do this trick
better than others.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:04.957
And some situations allow anybody
to do it more effectively

00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:06.741
than other situations do.

00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.566
It turns out that freedom,

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.916
the ability to make up your mind
and change your mind,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.495
is the friend of natural happiness,
because it allows you to choose

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.695
among all those delicious futures

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:23.202
and find the one
that you would most enjoy.

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:24.978
But freedom to choose,

00:14:25.002 --> 00:14:26.759
to change and make up your mind,

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.705
is the enemy of synthetic happiness.

00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:32.775
And I'm going to show you why.
Dilbert already knows, of course.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.981
"Dogbert's tech support.
How may I abuse you?"

00:14:35.005 --> 00:14:37.619
"My printer prints a blank
page after every document."

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.619
"Why complain about getting free paper?"

00:14:39.643 --> 00:14:41.919
"Free? Aren't you just
giving me my own paper?"

00:14:41.943 --> 00:14:45.619
"Look at the quality of the free paper
compared to your lousy regular paper!

00:14:45.643 --> 00:14:48.419
Only a fool or a liar would say
that they look the same!"

00:14:48.443 --> 00:14:51.205
"Now that you mention it,
it does seem a little silkier!"

00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:52.405
"What are you doing?"

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:55.984
"I'm helping people accept the things
they cannot change." Indeed.

00:14:56.775 --> 00:14:59.101
The psychological immune system works best

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:02.320
when we are totally stuck,
when we are trapped.

00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:04.726
This is the difference
between dating and marriage.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.319
You go out on a date with a guy,

00:15:06.343 --> 00:15:08.979
and he picks his nose;
you don't go out on another date.

00:15:09.003 --> 00:15:11.177
You're married to a guy
and he picks his nose?

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.683
He has a heart of gold.
Don't touch the fruitcake!

00:15:13.707 --> 00:15:17.420
You find a way to be happy
with what's happened.

00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:18.445
(Laughter)

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:19.858
Now, what I want to show you

00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:22.485
is that people don't know
this about themselves,

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:26.787
and not knowing this can work
to our supreme disadvantage.

00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:28.788
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.

00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:31.840
We created a black-and-white
photography course,

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:35.319
and we allowed students to come in
and learn how to use a darkroom.

00:15:35.343 --> 00:15:37.677
So we gave them cameras;
they went around campus;

00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:40.058
they took 12 pictures
of their favorite professors

00:15:40.082 --> 00:15:42.272
and their dorm room and their dog,

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:45.414
and all the other things they wanted
to have Harvard memories of.

00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:47.964
They bring us the camera;
we make up a contact sheet;

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:50.283
they figure out which are
the two best pictures;

00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:52.989
and we now spend six hours
teaching them about darkrooms.

00:15:53.013 --> 00:15:54.454
And they blow two of them up,

00:15:54.478 --> 00:15:56.724
and they have two gorgeous
eight-by-10 glossies

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.732
of meaningful things to them, and we say,

00:15:58.756 --> 00:16:00.596
"Which one would you like to give up?"

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.771
"I have to give one up?"

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.907
"Yes, we need one as evidence
of the class project.

00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:07.549
So you have to give me one.
You have to make a choice.

00:16:07.573 --> 00:16:10.319
You get to keep one,
and I get to keep one."

00:16:10.343 --> 00:16:13.319
Now, there are two conditions
in this experiment.

00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:15.621
In one case, the students are told,

00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:18.001
"But you know,
if you want to change your mind,

00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:19.878
I'll always have the other one here,

00:16:19.902 --> 00:16:24.265
and in the next four days, before
I actually mail it to headquarters" --

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:26.614
Yeah, "headquarters" --

00:16:26.638 --> 00:16:29.319
"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:32.313
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room,
just give me an email.

00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:34.328
Better yet, I'll check with you.

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:37.240
You ever want to change your mind,
it's totally returnable."

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:40.161
The other half of the students
are told exactly the opposite:

00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:41.812
"Make your choice, and by the way,

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.829
the mail is going out, gosh,
in two minutes, to England.

00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:47.575
Your picture will be winging
its way over the Atlantic.

00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:49.765
You will never see it again."

00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:52.043
Half of the students
in each of these conditions

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.479
are asked to make predictions

00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:57.114
about how much they're going to come
to like the picture that they keep

00:16:57.138 --> 00:16:58.819
and the picture they leave behind.

00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:01.750
Other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms

00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:04.885
and they are measured
over the next three to six days

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:07.184
on their liking, satisfaction
with the pictures.

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:08.400
And look at what we find.

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:11.548
First of all, here's what students
think is going to happen.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:15.372
They think they're going to maybe
come to like the picture they chose

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:17.885
a little more
than the one they left behind,

00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:20.969
but these are not statistically
significant differences.

00:17:20.993 --> 00:17:24.657
It's a very small increase,
and it doesn't much matter

00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.649
whether they were in the reversible
or irreversible condition.

00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:31.885
Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because
here's what's really happening.

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:35.306
Both right before the swap
and five days later,

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.516
people who are stuck with that picture,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.692
who have no choice,

00:17:38.716 --> 00:17:40.756
who can never change their mind,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.112
like it a lot!

00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:45.885
And people who are deliberating
-- "Should I return it?

00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:49.124
Have I gotten the right one?
Maybe this isn't the good one?

00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:51.740
Maybe I left the good one?" --
have killed themselves.

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:53.201
They don't like their picture,

00:17:53.225 --> 00:17:56.058
and in fact even after the opportunity
to swap has expired,

00:17:56.082 --> 00:17:58.175
they still don't like their picture.

00:17:58.199 --> 00:17:59.349
Why?

00:17:59.373 --> 00:18:03.368
Because the [reversible] condition
is not conducive

00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:05.140
to the synthesis of happiness.

00:18:05.164 --> 00:18:08.052
So here's the final piece
of this experiment.

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:11.885
We bring in a whole new group
of naive Harvard students

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:15.265
and we say, "You know,
we're doing a photography course,

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:16.861
and we can do it one of two ways.

00:18:17.607 --> 00:18:20.138
We could do it so that when
you take the two pictures,

00:18:20.162 --> 00:18:22.161
you'd have four days to change your mind,

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:25.058
or we're doing another course
where you take the two pictures

00:18:25.082 --> 00:18:28.165
and you make up your mind right away
and you can never change it.

00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:30.235
Which course would you like
to be in?" Duh!

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:32.885
66 percent of the students, two-thirds,

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:36.885
prefer to be in the course where they have
the opportunity to change their mind.

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:40.885
Hello? 66 percent of the students
choose to be in the course

00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:44.885
in which they will ultimately be deeply
dissatisfied with the picture.

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:50.885
Because they do not know the conditions
under which synthetic happiness grows.

00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:56.837
The Bard said everything best,
of course, and he's making my point here

00:18:56.861 --> 00:18:58.885
but he's making it hyperbolically:

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:01.885
"'Tis nothing good or bad /
But thinking makes it so."

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:05.348
It's nice poetry,
but that can't exactly be right.

00:19:05.372 --> 00:19:07.885
Is there really nothing good or bad?

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:11.258
Is it really the case that gall bladder
surgery and a trip to Paris

00:19:11.282 --> 00:19:12.893
are just the same thing?

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:14.004
(Laughter)

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:17.885
That seems like a one-question IQ test.

00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:19.885
They can't be exactly the same.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.885
In more turgid prose,
but closer to the truth,

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:26.283
was the father of modern capitalism,
Adam Smith, and he said this.

00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:28.262
This is worth contemplating:

00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:32.238
"The great source of both the misery
and disorders of human life

00:19:32.262 --> 00:19:34.885
seems to arise from overrating
the difference

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:37.885
between one permanent
situation and another --

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:43.206
Some of these situations may, no doubt,
deserve to be preferred to others,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.159
but none of them can deserve to be pursued

00:19:46.183 --> 00:19:50.627
with that passionate ardor
which drives us to violate the rules

00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:53.246
either of prudence or of justice,

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.035
or to corrupt the future
tranquility of our minds,

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:59.596
either by shame from the remembrance
of our own folly,

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.692
or by remorse for the horror
of our own injustice."

00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:08.448
In other words: yes, some things
are better than others.

00:20:08.472 --> 00:20:13.975
We should have preferences that lead us
into one future over another.

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:17.780
But when those preferences
drive us too hard and too fast

00:20:17.804 --> 00:20:21.495
because we have overrated
the difference between these futures,

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:23.488
we are at risk.

00:20:23.512 --> 00:20:27.797
When our ambition is bounded,
it leads us to work joyfully.

00:20:27.821 --> 00:20:29.693
When our ambition is unbounded,

00:20:29.717 --> 00:20:34.131
it leads us to lie, to cheat,
to steal, to hurt others,

00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:36.154
to sacrifice things of real value.

00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:38.195
When our fears are bounded,

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:40.354
we're prudent, we're cautious,

00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:41.589
we're thoughtful.

00:20:41.613 --> 00:20:44.848
When our fears
are unbounded and overblown,

00:20:44.872 --> 00:20:46.898
we're reckless, and we're cowardly.

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:50.975
The lesson I want to leave
you with, from these data,

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:55.078
is that our longings and our worries
are both to some degree overblown,

00:20:55.102 --> 00:21:01.274
because we have within us the capacity
to manufacture the very commodity

00:21:01.298 --> 00:21:05.717
we are constantly chasing
when we choose experience.

00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:06.892
Thank you.

00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:11.841
(Applause)
