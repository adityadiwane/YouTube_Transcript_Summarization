00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:15.106
I love museums.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.836
Have you guys ever been
to the Natural History Museum?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.276
In New York City?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.956
(Applause)

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.676
So one of the things that I do
is I take my kids to the museum.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.276
Recently I took them
to the Natural History Museum.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420
I had my two sons with me,
Sabian and Dabith.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.076
And we go into the front
entrance of the museum,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.220
and there's that amazing sculpture
of Teddy Roosevelt out there.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.756
You guys know which one I'm talking about.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.876
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there
with one hand on the horse,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.236
bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.276
I don't know if he's bare-chested,
but it kind of feels like it.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.636
(Laughter)

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.260
And on the left-hand side of him
is a Native American walking.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.260
And on the right-hand side of him
is an African-American walking.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.996
And as we're moving up the stairs,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.956
getting closer to the sculpture,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.036
my oldest son, who's nine, says,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.860
"Dad, how come he gets to ride,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.180
and they have to walk?"

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.700
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.396
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.876
There was so much history

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.556
that we would have to go through
to try to explain that,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.620
and that's something
I try to do with them anyways.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.516
It's a question that I probably
would have never really asked.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.716
But fundamentally what he was saying was,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.516
"That doesn't look fair.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.060
Dad, that doesn't look fair.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.436
And why is this thing that's so not fair

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.540
sitting outside
of such an amazing institution."

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.116
And his question got me wondering,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.996
is there a way for us
to amend our public sculptures,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.380
our national monuments?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.340
Not erase them,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.712
but is there a way to amend them?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.876
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.236
That's not my history.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.436
My mother was 15 years old
when I was born.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.780
She is amazing.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.276
My father was struggling
with his own things

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.500
for most of my life.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.676
If you really want to know the truth,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.500
the only reason I got into art
is because of a woman.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.636
There was this amazing, amazing,
fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.996
four years older than me,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.836
and I wanted to go out with her.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.356
But she said, "You're too young

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.596
and you're not thinking
about your future."

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.276
So I ran on down to the junior college,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.476
registered for some classes,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.156
ran on back,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.996
and basically was like,
"I'm thinking about my future now."

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.436
(Laughter)

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.780
"Can we go out?"

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.316
For the record, she's even more amazing.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.556
I married her.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.340
(Applause)

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.836
So when I randomly ran down
to the junior college

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.236
and registered for classes,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.956
I really wasn't paying attention
to what I was registering to.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.236
(Laughter)

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.996
So I ended up with an art history class,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.260
and I didn't know a thing
about art history.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.900
But something amazing happened
when I went into that class.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.316
For the first time in my academic career,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.716
my visual intelligence was required of me.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.356
For the first time.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.436
The professor would put up an image,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.596
bold strokes of blues and yellows,
and say, "Who's that?"

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.516
And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh.
Clearly that is Van Gogh.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.116
I got this."

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.076
(Laughter)

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.036
I got a B in that class.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.300
For me, that was amazing.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.476
In high school, let's just say
I wasn't a great student. OK?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.916
In high school, my GPA was .65.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.436
(Laughter)

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.756
Decimal point first, six five.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.916
So me getting a B was huge, huge,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.676
absolutely huge.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.636
And because of the fact that I realized
that I was able to learn things visually

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.396
that I couldn't learn in other ways,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.276
this became my strategy,
this became my tactic

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.180
for understanding everything else.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.516
I wanted to stay in this relationship.
Things were going well.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.196
I decided, let me keep taking
these art history classes.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.796
One of the last art history classes,
I will not forget, I will never forget.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.036
It was one of those survey
art history classes.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.796
Anybody ever have one of those
survey art history classes,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.756
where they try to teach you
the entire history of art

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.236
in a single semester?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.276
I'm talking about cave paintings
and Jackson Pollock

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.556
just crunched together all in the same --

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.860
It doesn't really work,
but they try anyway.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.996
Well, at the beginning of the semester,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.236
I looked at the book,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.196
and in this 400-page book
was about a 14-page section

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.316
that was on black people in painting.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.356
Now, this was a crammed in section

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.756
that had representations
of black people in painting

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.516
and black people who painted.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.836
It was poorly curated,
let's just put it that way.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.076
(Laughter)

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.436
Nonetheless I was really excited about it,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.756
because in all
the other classes that I had,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.420
we didn't even have that conversation.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.420
We didn't talk about it at all.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.276
So imagine my surprise

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.876
when I get to class

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.116
and on the day that we're supposed
to go over that particular chapter,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.660
my professor announces,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.876
"We're going to skip this chapter today

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.060
because we do not have time
to go through it."

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.516
"Whoa, I'm sorry,
hold on, professor, professor.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.340
I'm sorry. This is a really
important chapter to me.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.396
Are we going to go over it at any point?"

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.236
"Titus, we don't have time for this."

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.356
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.116
please, I really need to understand.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.556
Clearly the author thinks
that this is significant.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.116
Why are we skipping over this?"

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.156
"Titus, I do not have time for this."

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.436
"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.516
When can we talk,
because we need to talk."

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.356
(Laughter)

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.940
I went to her office hours.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.156
I ended up getting kicked
out of her office.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.676
I went to the dean.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.756
The dean finally told me,
"I can't force her to teach anything."

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.836
And I knew in that moment
if I wanted to understand this history,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.276
if I wanted to understand the roles
of those folks who had to walk,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.180
I was probably going
to have to figure that out myself.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.620
So ...

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.352
above you right here on the slide

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.460
is a painting by Frans Hals.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.756
This is one of the kinds of images

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.340
that was in that chapter.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.236
I taught myself how to paint

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.180
by going to museums
and looking at images like this.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.841
I want to show you something.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.140
I made this.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.356
I --

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.796
(Applause)

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.076
I made some alterations.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.060
You'll see there are
some slight differences in the painting.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.356
All this art history
that I had been absorbing

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.740
helped me to realize
that painting is a language.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.300
There is a reason

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.540
why he is the highest
in the composition here.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.380
There is a reason

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.900
why the painter is showing us
this gold necklace here.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.196
He's trying to tell us something
about the economic status

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.887
of these people in these paintings.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.076
Painting is a visual language

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.596
where everything in the painting

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.316
is meaningful, is important.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.580
It's coded.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.516
But sometimes, because
of the compositional structure,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.340
because of compositional hierarchy,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.340
it's hard to see other things.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.700
This silk is supposed to tell us also
that they have quite a bit of money.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.316
There's more written

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.300
about dogs in art history

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.100
than there are about
this other character here.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.116
Historically speaking,
in research on these kinds of paintings,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.116
I can find out more about the lace

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.116
that the woman is wearing
in this painting --

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.876
the manufacturer of the lace --
than I can about this character here,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.036
about his dreams, about his hopes,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.940
about what he wanted out of life.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.580
I want to show you something.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.876
I don't want you to think

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.836
that this is about eradication.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.076
It's not.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.236
The oil that you saw me
just put inside of this paint

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.756
is linseed oil.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.596
It becomes transparent over time,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.340
so eventually what's going to happen

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.300
is these faces

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.380
will emerge a little bit.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.420
What I'm trying to do,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.474
what I'm trying to show you,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.596
is how to shift your gaze just slightly,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.516
just momentarily,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.956
just momentarily,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.540
to ask yourself the question,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.156
why do some have to walk?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.436
What is the impact of these kinds
of sculptures at museums?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.036
What is the impact
of these kinds of paintings

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.956
on some of our most vulnerable in society,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.820
seeing these kinds of depictions
of themselves all the time?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.796
I'm not saying erase it.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.260
We can't erase this history.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.060
It's real. We have to know it.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.636
I think of it in the same way

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.900
we think of --

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.676
Let me step back a second.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.036
You remember old-school cameras,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.356
where when you took a picture,
you actually had to focus. Right?

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.636
You'd put the camera up,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.636
and if I wanted you in focus,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.660
I would move the lens a little to the left

00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:01.996
and you would come forward.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.116
I could move the lens
a little to the right,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.396
and you would go back and the folks
in the background would come out.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.436
I'm just trying to do that here.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.036
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.276
I'm trying to answer that question

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.740
that my son had.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.876
I want to make paintings,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.156
I want to make sculptures

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.700
that are honest,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.460
that wrestle with
the struggles of our past

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.780
but speak to the diversity
and the advances of our present.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.876
And we can't do that by taking an eraser
and getting rid of stuff.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.636
That's just not going to work.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.756
I think that we should
do it in the same way

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.356
the American Constitution works.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.636
When we have a situation

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.516
where we want to change
a law in the American Constitution,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.316
we don't erase the other one.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.556
Alongside that is an amendment,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.836
something that says,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.620
"This is where we were,
but this is where we are right now."

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.716
I figure if we can do that,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.076
then that will help us
understand a little bit

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.300
about where we're going.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.516
Thank you.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.180
(Applause)
