00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.330
ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
by a guy named Jack Harlan.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And he described the diversity within crops --

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such --

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
as a genetic resource.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
And he said, "This genetic resource," --

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and I'll never forget the words --

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
"stands between us and catastrophic starvation

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
on a scale we cannot imagine."

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I figured he was either really on to something,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
or he was one of these academic nutcases.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
So, I looked a little further,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
He was the most respected scientist in the field.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.330
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity --

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
is the biological foundation of agriculture.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
It's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Not a trivial matter.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
literally crumbling.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
That indeed, a mass extinction was underway

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
in our fields, in our agricultural system.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
And that this mass extinction was taking place

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
with very few people noticing

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
and even fewer caring.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
Now, I know that many of you don't stop

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
to think about diversity in agricultural systems

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and, let's face it, that's logical.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
You don't see it in the newspaper every day.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.330
You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
So, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
Here's some beans,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.330
and there are about 35 or 40 different

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
varieties of beans on this picture.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.330
If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.330
because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
it would take up my entire TED talk,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
and I wouldn't have to say anything.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is --

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
that this diversity is being lost.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.330
and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
but it's being lost.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
And I want to give you an example of that.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
It's a bit of a personal example, in fact.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
In the United States, in the 1800s -- that's where we have the best data --

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.330
farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
named varieties of apples.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.330
Today, 6,800 of those are extinct,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
no longer to be seen again.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
I used to have a list of these extinct apples,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and when I would go out and give a presentation,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
I would pass the list out in the audience.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
their mother's maiden name.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.330
And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?"

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.330
And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
They gave them their name.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
The bad news is they're extinct.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.330
The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list."

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
So, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
that the Fowler apple is still out there.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And there's an old book back here,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
and I want to read a piece from it.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
This book was published in 1904.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
See, we used to have a lot of apples.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.330
And the Fowler apple is described in here --

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
I hope this doesn't surprise you --

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
as, "a beautiful fruit."

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.330
(Laughter)

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
but, to be honest, the description goes on

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
And then he has to go even further.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.330
"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
and is, on the whole, unsatisfactory."

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
(Laughter)

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
and the lesson is: so why save it?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And there are a couple of answers to that question.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.330
Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.330
or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
has disease or pest resistance

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.330
or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
So it's not necessary, thank God,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.330
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
And for that reason, we ought to be saving it.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.330
Why? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:46.330
Think of diversity as giving us options.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.330
And options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
I want to show you two slides,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington --

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
to be able to adapt to this?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
than anything those crops have seen in the past.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
The coldest growing seasons of the future,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
hotter than the hottest of the past.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
Is agriculture adapted to that?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
I don't know. Can fish play the piano?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.330
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.330
Now, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
In the histogram before you now,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
going back about far as we have temperature data.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
And you can see that there's some difference

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
between one growing season and another.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Some are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:16.330
The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.330
In the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
totally out of bounds.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
The agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
have never experienced this before.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Here's South Africa. The same story.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop --

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field --

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.330
because of the climate change already in 2030.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
that's a food crisis. It's global in nature.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
We will watch children starve to death on TV.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
It's two breeding cycles for maize.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
We have to get climate-ready crops in the field,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.330
and we have to do that rather quickly.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
Now, the good news is that we have conserved.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
If you want to conserve seed for a long term

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
you dry it and then you freeze it.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
Unfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
and they're vulnerable.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
In Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
and all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
it means extinction. We lose diversity.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.330
And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.330
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
actually losing it, never to be seen again.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.330
So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.330
and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.330
that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of --

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
maybe not the most charismatic diversity.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:43.330
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
but it's very important diversity.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:55.330
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
To Svalbard, in fact.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
That's at 78 degrees north.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It's otherworldly, beautiful.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
We worked with the Norwegian government

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
and with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
to design this facility.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
What you see is an artist's conception of this facility,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
which is built in a mountain in Svalbard.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
so we get natural freezing temperatures.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.330
But it's remote. It's remote and accessible

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:49.330
This is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.330
And this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.330
And here's the front door of this facility.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
When you open up the front door,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
It's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
chiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
There are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
I think of it as sort of a cathedral.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.330
And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
(Laughter)

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
(Laughter)

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
in this place there.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.330
(Applause)

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:50.330
If you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.330
It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.330
We have now about 425,000

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
samples of unique crop varieties.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.330
There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
in this facility right now.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
About a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples --

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
about 500 seeds --

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.330
of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
in this facility.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
This is a backup system for world agriculture.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
It operates like a safety deposit box.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:42.330
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.330
And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
of Canada, and an international institution from Syria.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.330
I think it's interesting in that this facility, I think,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.330
is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
literally, every country in the world --

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
because we have seeds from every country in the world --

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
all the countries of the world have gotten together

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:16.330
to do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.330
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.330
for climate change, for the water crisis.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.330
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.330
for those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:50.330
but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
if we don't have crop diversity.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:15:00.330
Because I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.330
solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:10.330
Because, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
neither will we.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.330
And if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
neither will we.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
So, this is not something pretty and nice to do.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
just for the existence value of it.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.330
It is, I agree, a nice thing to do.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
But it's a necessary thing to do.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:38.330
So, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.330
should get organized to complete the task.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
that Norway and others have given us,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
but it's not the complete answer.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
We need to put it into good seed banks

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.330
that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
We need to catalog it. It's a library of life,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.330
but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
And we need to support it financially.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.330
My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.330
to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.330
we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.330
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.330
of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:40.330
And my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.330
rice, potatoes, and the other crops,

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.330
we may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.330
Thank you.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:17:01.330
(Applause)
