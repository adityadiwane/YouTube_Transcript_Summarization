00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:15.898
I'm a marine biologist
and an explorer-photographer

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.663
with National Geographic,

00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:19.365
but I want to share a secret.

00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:23.436
This image is totally incorrect,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.197
totally incorrect.

00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.348
I see a couple of people
crying in the back

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.816
that I've blown their idea of mermaids.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.491
All right, the mermaid is indeed real,

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.650
but anyone who's gone on a dive

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:37.272
will know that the ocean
looks more like this.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:41.267
It's because the ocean
is this massive filter,

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.364
and as soon as you start going underwater,

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:45.061
you're going to lose your colors,

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:48.291
and it's going to get dark
and blue very quickly.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.100
But we're humans --
we're terrestrial mammals.

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:53.299
And we've got trichromatic vision,

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:55.989
so we see in red, green and blue,

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:58.338
and we're just complete color addicts.

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:01.005
We love eye-popping color,

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:03.616
and we try to bring this eye-popping color

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.020
underwater with us.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:09.081
So there's been a long and sordid history
of bringing color underwater,

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:14.051
and it starts 88 years ago
with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.996
who were trying to take
the first underwater color photograph.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.735
And they're in there
with old-school scuba suits,

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.884
where you're pumping air down to them,

00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:27.498
and they've got a pontoon
of high-explosive magnesium powder,

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.729
and the poor people
at the surface are not sure

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:33.383
when they're going to pull the string
when they've got their frame in focus,

00:01:33.407 --> 00:01:36.331
and -- boom! -- a pound
of high explosives would go off

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:39.410
so they could put
a little bit of light underwater

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:42.204
and get an image
like this beautiful hogfish.

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:45.077
I mean, it's a gorgeous image,
but this is not real.

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:47.860
They're creating an artificial environment

00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:51.560
so we can satisfy
our own addiction to color.

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:55.824
And looking at it the other way,
what we've been finding

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:59.052
is that instead of bringing color
underwater with us,

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:01.828
that we've been looking at the blue ocean,

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.114
and it's a crucible of blue,

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:07.234
and these animals living there
for millions of years

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:11.788
have been evolving all sorts of ways
to take in that blue light

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.503
and give off other colors.

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:16.813
And here's just a little sample
of what this secret world looks like.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.715
It's like an underwater light show.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.823
(Music)

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:27.415
Again, what we're seeing here
is blue light hitting this image.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.528
These animals are absorbing the blue light

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.033
and immediately transforming this light.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.763
So if you think about it, the ocean
is 71 percent of the planet,

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:43.857
and blue light can extend down
to almost a 1,000 meters.

00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:45.985
As we go down underwater,

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.703
after about 10 meters,
all the red is gone.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.930
So if you see anything
under 10 meters that's red,

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:55.012
it's an animal transforming
and creating its own red.

00:02:55.472 --> 00:03:01.725
This is the largest single monochromatic
blue environment on our planet.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.360
And my gateway into this world
of biofluorescence begins with corals.

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:09.470
And I want to give
a full TED Talk on corals

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:11.296
and just how cool these things are.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.542
One of the things that they do,
one of their miraculous feats,

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:17.344
is they produce lots of these
fluorescent proteins,

00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:18.853
fluorescent molecules.

00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:23.624
And in this coral, it could be making
up to 14 percent of its body mass --

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.733
could be this fluorescent protein.

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:30.186
So you wouldn't be making, like,
14 percent muscle and not using it,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.794
so it's likely doing something
that has a functional role.

00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:37.655
And for the last 10, 15 years,
this was so special to me,

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:43.099
because this molecule has turned out
to be one of the most revolutionary tools

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.823
in biomedical science,

00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:48.361
and it's allowing us
to better see inside ourselves.

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.805
So, how do I study this?

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.900
In order to study biofluorescence,
we swim at night.

00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:56.302
And when I started out,

00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:00.337
I was just using these blue
duct-tape filters over my strobe,

00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:02.740
so I could make sure
I'm actually seeing the light

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.796
that's being transformed by the animals.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.297
We're making an exhibit
for the Museum of Natural History,

00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:12.128
and we're trying to show off how great
the fluorescent corals are on the reef,

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.208
and something happened
that just blew me away:

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.621
this.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:18.461
In the middle of our corals,

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.491
is this green fluorescent fish.

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.327
It's the first time we've ever seen
a green fluorescent fish

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.978
or any vertebrate for that matter.

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.557
And we're rubbing our eyes,
checking the filters,

00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:31.780
thinking that somebody's maybe
playing a joke on us with the camera,

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.747
but the eel was real.

00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:37.310
It was the first green
fluorescent eel that we found,

00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:40.293
and this just changed
my trajectory completely.

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:43.651
So I had to put down my corals and team up

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:45.708
with a fish scientist, John Sparks,

00:04:45.732 --> 00:04:48.231
and begin a search around the world

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:51.506
to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.005
And fish are much more
interesting than corals,

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.243
because they have really advanced vision,

00:04:56.267 --> 00:05:00.052
and some of the fish even have,
the way that I was photographing it,

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:03.512
they have lenses in their eyes
that would magnify the fluorescence.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.846
So I wanted to seek this out further.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.592
So we designed a new set of gear

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.905
and we're scouring the reefs
around the world,

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:11.508
looking for fluorescent life.

00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:13.587
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."

00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:16.320
We're out there swimming
with this blue light,

00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:18.549
and we're looking for a response,

00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:22.148
for animals to be absorbing the light
and transferring this back to us.

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:26.884
And eventually, we found
our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.

00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:31.378
It's a really shy, reclusive eel
that we know almost nothing about.

00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:33.363
They're only about the size of my finger,

00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:37.867
and they spend about 99.9 percent
of their time hidden under a rock.

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:42.012
But these eels do come out to mate
under full-moon nights,

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:45.529
and that full-moon night
translates underwater to blue.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.083
Perhaps they're using this
as a way to see each other,

00:05:48.107 --> 00:05:49.568
quickly find each other, mate,

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:53.306
go back into their hole
for the next long stint of time.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.210
But then we started to find
other fluorescent marine life,

00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.031
like this green fluorescent bream,

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:03.040
with its, like, racing stripes
along its head and its nape,

00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:07.365
and it's almost camouflaged
and fluorescing at the same intensity

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.175
as the fluorescent coral there.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.277
After this fish,

00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:16.602
we were introduced to this red
fluorescent scorpionfish

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.769
cloaked and hidden on this rock.

00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:22.594
The only time we've ever seen this,
it's either on red fluorescent algae

00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:24.293
or red fluorescent coral.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:29.967
Later, we found this stealthy
green fluorescent lizardfish.

00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.079
These lizardfish come in many varieties,

00:06:32.103 --> 00:06:35.372
and they look almost exactly alike
under white light.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.770
But if you look at them
under fluorescent light,

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:39.195
you see lots of patterns,

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.905
you can really see
the differences among them.

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.866
And in total -- we just reported
this last year --

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.238
we found over 200 species
of biofluorescent fish.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:56.061
One of my inspirations is French artist
and biologist Jean Painlevé.

00:06:56.085 --> 00:07:00.134
He really captures this entrepreneuring,
creative spirit in biology.

00:07:00.158 --> 00:07:03.961
He would design his own gear,
make his own cameras,

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:07.979
and he was fascinated with the seahorse,
Hippocampus erectus,

00:07:08.003 --> 00:07:11.230
and he filmed for the first time
the seahorse giving birth.

00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:13.638
So this is the male seahorse.

00:07:13.662 --> 00:07:18.376
They were one of the first fish
to start swimming upright

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.028
with their brain above their head.

00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:21.203
The males give birth,

00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.647
just phenomenal creatures.

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:26.297
So he stayed awake for days.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.496
He even put this electrical visor
on his head that would shock him,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.112
so he could capture this moment.

00:07:32.796 --> 00:07:34.916
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.037
the moment where we found
biofluorescent seahorses

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:40.760
in the exact same species
that he was studying.

00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:41.998
And here's our footage.

00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:44.849
(Music)

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:47.943
They're the most cryptic fish.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.347
You could be swimming right on top of them
and not see the seahorse.

00:07:52.228 --> 00:07:56.736
They would blend right into the algae,
which would also fluoresce red,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.221
but they've got great vision,

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.419
and they go through
this long mating ritual,

00:08:00.443 --> 00:08:02.545
and perhaps they're using it
in that effect.

00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:06.566
But things got pretty edgy

00:08:07.442 --> 00:08:12.455
when we found green
fluorescence in the stingray,

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.243
because stingrays are
in the Elasmobranch class,

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:16.506
which includes ...

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:18.534
sharks.

00:08:18.558 --> 00:08:21.756
So I'm, like, a coral biologist.

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:25.606
Somebody's got to go down and check
to see if the sharks are fluorescent.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.892
And there I am.

00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:28.314
(Laughter)

00:08:28.338 --> 00:08:30.877
And I was like, "Maybe I should
go back to corals."

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:31.933
(Laughter)

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:34.353
It turns out that these sharks
are not fluorescent.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.889
And then we found it.

00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:41.751
In a deep, dark canyon
off the coast of California,

00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:46.212
we found the first
biofluorescent swellshark,

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:48.011
right underneath all the surfers.

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:49.220
Here it is.

00:08:49.244 --> 00:08:51.968
They're just about a meter long.
It's called a swellshark.

00:08:51.992 --> 00:08:54.904
And they call them a swellshark
because if they're threatened,

00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:57.674
they can gulp down water
and blow up like an inner tube,

00:08:57.698 --> 00:08:58.857
about twice their size,

00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:03.626
and wedge themselves under a rock,
so they don't get eaten by a predator.

00:09:04.158 --> 00:09:08.301
And here is our first footage
of these biofluorescent swellsharks.

00:09:09.229 --> 00:09:13.950
Just magnificent -- I mean,
they're showing these distinct patterns,

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:17.547
and there are areas that are fluorescent
and areas that are not fluorescent,

00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:20.160
but they've also got these
twinkling spots on them

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:22.775
that are much brighter
than other parts of the shark.

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:25.326
But this is all beautiful to see.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.980
I was like, this is gorgeous.

00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:29.835
But what does it mean to the shark?

00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:31.206
Can they see this?

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.762
And we looked in the literature,

00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:35.944
and nothing was known
about this shark's vision.

00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:40.150
So I took this shark to eye specialist
Ellis Loew at Cornell University,

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:43.697
and we found out that this shark
sees discretely and acutely

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:45.815
in the blue-green interface,

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:48.669
probably about 100 times better
than we can see in the dark,

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:50.419
but they only see blue-green.

00:09:50.443 --> 00:09:53.562
So what it's doing
is taking this blue world

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:56.339
and it's absorbing the blue,
creating green.

00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:59.181
It's creating contrast
that they can indeed see.

00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:00.356
So we have a model,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.752
showing that it creates an ability
for them to see all these patterns.

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:06.657
And males and females
also have, we're finding,

00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:08.617
distinct patterns among them.

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:14.709
But our last find came really just
a few miles from where we are now,

00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:16.184
in the Solomon Islands.

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:20.668
Swimming at night, I encountered
the first biofluorescent sea turtle.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:24.104
So now it's going from fish
and sharks into reptiles,

00:10:24.128 --> 00:10:27.412
which, again, this is only one month old,

00:10:27.436 --> 00:10:29.814
but it shows us
that we know almost nothing

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.112
about this hawksbill turtle's vision.

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.992
And it makes me think about
how much more there is to learn.

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.548
And here in the Solomon Islands,

00:10:36.572 --> 00:10:40.143
there's only a few thousand
breeding females of this species left,

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:42.211
and this is one of the hotspots for them.

00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:45.302
So it shows us how much we need
to really protect these animals

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:47.682
while they're still here,
and understand them.

00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:49.850
In thinking about biofluorescence,

00:10:49.874 --> 00:10:51.819
I wanted to know, how deep does it go?

00:10:51.843 --> 00:10:54.287
Does this go all the way
to the bottom of the ocean?

00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:57.858
So we started using submarines,
and we equipped them

00:10:57.882 --> 00:11:00.056
with special blue lights
on the front here.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.040
And we dropped down,

00:11:02.064 --> 00:11:04.781
and we noticed one important thing --

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:08.103
that as we get down to 1,000 meters,

00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:09.443
it drops off.

00:11:09.467 --> 00:11:13.371
There's no biofluorescent marine life
down there, below 1,000 meters --

00:11:13.395 --> 00:11:15.400
almost nothing, it's just darkness.

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.854
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:19.331
And below 1,000 meters,

00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:22.016
we encountered the bioluminescent zone,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.377
where nine out of 10 animals
are actually making their own lights

00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.155
and flashing and blinking.

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:28.552
As I try to get deeper,

00:11:28.576 --> 00:11:31.551
this is slapping on a one-person
submarine suit --

00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:35.338
some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau
meets Woody Allen" moment.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.513
(Laughter)

00:11:36.537 --> 00:11:38.588
But as we explore down here,

00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:42.331
I was thinking about: How do we
interact with life delicately?

00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:45.052
Because we're entering
a new age of exploration,

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.879
where we have to take great care,

00:11:46.903 --> 00:11:49.598
and we have to set examples
how we explore.

00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:53.286
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood
at Harvard University,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.449
and we've been designing
squishy underwater robot fingers,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.462
so we can delicately interact
with the marine life down there.

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:06.201
The idea is that most of our technologies
to explore the deep ocean

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.005
come from oil and gas and military,

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:11.870
who, you know, they're not really
caring to be gentle.

00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:14.577
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.710
You don't want to just go
and crush them with a big claw.

00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:19.732
So my dream is something like this.

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:22.052
At night, I'm in a submarine,

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.186
I have force-feedback gloves,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.528
and I could delicately set up
a lab in the front of my submarine,

00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:30.091
where the squishy robot fingers

00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:32.600
are delicately collecting
and putting things in jars,

00:12:32.624 --> 00:12:34.209
and we can conduct our research.

00:12:34.607 --> 00:12:37.457
Back to the powerful applied applications.

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:40.321
Here, you're looking at a living brain

00:12:40.345 --> 00:12:43.712
that's using the DNA
of fluorescent marine creatures,

00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:45.742
this one from jellyfish and corals,

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:49.235
to illuminate the living brain
and see its connections.

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:50.775
It's funny that we're using RGB

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:53.347
just to kind of satisfy
our own human intuition,

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.705
so we can see our brains better.

00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:57.777
And even more mind-blowing,

00:12:57.801 --> 00:13:00.911
is my close colleague
Vincent Pieribone at Yale,

00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:04.312
who has actually designed and engineered
a fluorescent protein

00:13:04.336 --> 00:13:06.431
that responds to voltage.

00:13:06.455 --> 00:13:09.557
So he could see
when a single neuron fires.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:14.120
You're essentially looking at
a portal into consciousness

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:17.058
that was designed by marine creatures.

00:13:18.102 --> 00:13:22.788
So this brings me all back
to perspective and relationship.

00:13:22.812 --> 00:13:25.051
From deep space,

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:28.227
our universe looks
like a human brain cell,

00:13:28.251 --> 00:13:30.733
and then here we are in the deep ocean,

00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:33.628
and we're finding
marine creatures and cells

00:13:33.652 --> 00:13:35.931
that can illuminate the human mind.

00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:39.073
And it's my hope
that with illuminated minds,

00:13:39.097 --> 00:13:42.882
we could ponder the overarching
interconnectedness of all life,

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.264
and fathom how much more lies in store

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:47.003
if we keep our oceans healthy.

00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:48.185
Thank you.

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:53.325
(Applause)
