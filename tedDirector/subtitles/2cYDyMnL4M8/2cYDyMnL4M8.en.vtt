00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Let me talk about India

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
through the evolution of ideas.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
because in every society, especially an open democratic society,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
it's only when ideas take root that things change.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Slowly ideas lead to ideology,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
lead to policies that lead to actions.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
And today, after the global economic crisis,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
there was a whole new set of rules

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
about how the state should intervene.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
So ideas change states.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And I looked at India and said,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
really there are four kinds of ideas

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
which really make an impact on India.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
The first, to my mind,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
These ideas have brought together something

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
which has made India happen the way it is today.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Those are ideas which have been accepted

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
but not implemented yet.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
The third set of ideas are what I call as

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
"ideas that we argue about" --

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
those are ideas where we have a fight,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
an ideological battle about how to do things.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
"the ideas that we need to anticipate."

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Because when you are a developing country

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
you can actually anticipate

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
what that did and do things very differently.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
which are responsible for where it has come today.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
The first is really the notion of people.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
In the '60s and '70s

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
we thought of people as a burden.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
We thought of people as a liability.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Today we talk of people as an asset.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
We talk of people as human capital.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And I believe this change in the mindset,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
of looking at people as something of a burden

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
to human capital,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
And this change in thinking of human capital

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
is linked to the fact

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
that India is going through a demographic dividend.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
As healthcare improves,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
as infant mortality goes down,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
India is going to have

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
a lot of young people with a demographic dividend

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
for the next 30 years.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
What is unique about this demographic dividend

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
is that India will be the only country in the world

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
to have this demographic dividend.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And this is very important. At the same time

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
there are actually two demographic curves.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
One is in the south and in the west of India,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
almost equal to that of a West European country.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Then there is the whole northern India,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
But a demographic dividend is only as good

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
as the investment in your human capital.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
Only if the people have education,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
they have good health, they have infrastructure,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
only in those cases can you really get the benefit

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
of a demographic dividend.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
the same demographic dividend

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
can be a demographic disaster.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
Therefore India is at a critical point

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
where either it can leverage its demographic dividend

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
or it can lead to a demographic disaster.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
The second thing in India has been the change in

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
the role of entrepreneurs.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
entrepreneurs have become role models,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and they are contributing hugely to the society.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
This change has contributed

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
to the vitality and the whole economy.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
The third big thing I believe that has changed India

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
is our attitude towards the English language.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
But today, with globalization,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
And the fact that we have English is now becoming

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
a huge strategic asset.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
The next thing is technology.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Forty years back, computers were seen

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
as something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
something that reduced jobs.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Today we live in a country

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
which sells eight million mobile phones a month,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
of which 90 percent of those mobile phones

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
are prepaid phones

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
because people don't have credit history.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Forty percent of those prepaid phones

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
That is the scale at which

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
technology has liberated and made it accessible.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
And therefore technology has gone

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
from being seen as something forbidding

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
and intimidating to something that is empowering.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Twenty years back,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
when there was a report on bank computerization,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
they didn't name the report as

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
a report on computers,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
they call them as "ledger posting machines."

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
So we have come a long way from those days

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
And then I think the other point

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
is that Indians today are far more

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
comfortable with globalization.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
under the East India Company and under imperial rule,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
believing it was a form of imperialism.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
But today, as Indian companies go abroad,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
as Indians come and work all over the world,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
Indians have gained a lot more confidence

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
because we are the only young country in an aging world,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
And finally, India has had

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
the deepening of its democracy.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
When democracy came to India 60 years back

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
it was an elite concept.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
because they wanted to bring in the idea of

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
But today democracy has become a bottom-up process

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
where everybody has realized

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
the benefits of having a voice,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
the benefits of being in an open society.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
And therefore democracy has become embedded.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
I believe these six factors --

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
the rise of the notion of population as human capital,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
the rise of English as a language of aspiration,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
technology as something empowering,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
globalization as a positive factor,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
to why India is today growing

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
at rates it has never seen before.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
But having said that,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
but you are not able to implement those things.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And really there are four things here.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
One is the question of education.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
primary education was never given the focus it required.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
But now I believe it's reached a point

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
where it has become very important.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
Unfortunately the government schools don't function,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
so children are going to private schools today.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
Even in the slums of India

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
But having said that, there is an enormous desire

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
So I believe primary education is an idea

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
which is arrived but not yet implemented.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
Similarly, infrastructure --

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160
It's certainly not like China.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
It is reflected in the political statements.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
which means "Electricity, water and roads."

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
And that is a change in the mindset

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
where infrastructure is now accepted.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
but simply not implemented.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
The third thing is again cities.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
It's because Gandhi believed in villages

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
and because the British ruled from the cities,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
For a long time we have neglected our cities.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
But today, finally, after economic reforms,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
and economic growth,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
I think the notion that cities are engines

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
of economic growth,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
cities are engines of creativity,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
cities are engines of innovation,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
have finally been accepted.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
because when you didn't think of India as a market,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
And therefore you had a situation

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
where every state had its own market for products.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Every province had its own market for agriculture.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Increasingly now the policies of

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
taxation and infrastructure and all that,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
are moving towards creating India as a single market.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
which is as important as external globalization.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
These four factors I believe --

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
the ones of primary education,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
in my view are ideas in India

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
which have been accepted, but not implemented.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
The ideas that we argue about.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
and because of the fact that there have been many people

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
who have been left out in the cold,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
that we'll address that.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And it leads to reservations and other techniques.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
and all the left and right arguments that we have.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
of caste and other things.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
This policy is causing gridlock.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
The second one is the labor policies that we have,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
which make it so difficult for

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
that 93 percent of Indian labor

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
is in the unorganized sector.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
They have no benefits: they don't have social security;

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
into the formal workforce,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.160
which are not as onerous as they are today.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
The third thing is our higher education.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
Indian higher education is completely regulated.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
It's very difficult to start a private university.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
As a result of that our higher education

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
But most important I believe

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
are the ideas we need to anticipate.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
Here India can look at what is happening in the west

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
The first thing is, we're very fortunate

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
that technology is at a point

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
where it is much more advanced

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
than when other countries had the development.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
So we can use technology for governance.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
We can use technology for direct benefits.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
The second thing is, the health issue.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
India has equally horrible

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
with a set of rich country diseases.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
We really need to put in place a strategy

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
so that we don't go to the other extreme of health.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
Similarly today in the West

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
you're seeing the problem of entitlement --

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160
the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
Therefore when you are a young country,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And then again, India does not have the luxury

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
of making its environment dirty,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.160
because it has to marry environment and development.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilize

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
at something like 20 gigatons per year.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
On a population of nine billion

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
India is already at two tons per year.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
But if India grows at something like eight percent,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160
income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.160
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
the way we look at energy,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
the way we create whole new paradigms of development.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Now why does this matter to you?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
Number one, this matters because

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
this represents more than a billion people.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
It matters because this is a democracy.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
And it is important to prove

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
that growth and democracy are not incompatible,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
and you can have growth.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
It's important because if you solve these problems,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
It's important because

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
you need it to solve the world's environment problems.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
If we really want to come to a point,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
we want to really lower the use of energy --

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
it has to be solved in countries like India.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
You know if you look at the development

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
in the West over 200 years,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
the average growth may have been about two percent.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
And that makes a huge difference.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.160
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
and the population was growing at two percent,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
When the economic growth goes to eight percent

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
then per capita income is doubling every nine years.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
of a billion people going to prosperity.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
And you must have a clear strategy

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
which is important for India and important for the world.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
That is why I think all of you

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
should be equally concerned with it as I am.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
Thank you very much.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.160
(Applause)
