00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:15.957
I'm here today to talk about social change,

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:19.240
not a new therapy or a new intervention

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.957
or a new way of working with kids
or something like that,

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:24.902
but a new business model for social change,

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:27.809
a new way of tackling the problem.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.983
In Britain, 63 percent of all men

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.046
who come out of short sentences from prison

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:37.567
re-offend again within a year.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.185
Now how many previous offenses

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.568
do you think they have on average

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:45.153
managed to commit?

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:47.301
Forty-three.

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.964
And how many previous times
do you think they've been in prison?

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:52.151
Seven.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.965
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.853
and we said to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.205
what's it worth to you

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.382
if fewer of these guys re-offend?

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:03.551
It's got to be worth something, right?

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:05.378
I mean, there's prison costs,

00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:08.906
there's police costs, there's court costs,

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:11.638
all these things that you're spending money on

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.151
to deal with these guys. What's it worth?

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.146
Now, of course, we care about the social value.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:20.432
Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,

00:01:20.432 --> 00:01:22.675
cares about social stuff.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:25.717
But we wanted to make the economic case,

00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:27.495
because if we could make the economic case,

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.516
then the value of doing this 
would be completely compelling.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:33.351
And if we can agree on both a value

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.688
and a way of measuring whether we've been

00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:38.086
successful at reducing that re-offending,

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.057
then we can do something

00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:42.620
we think rather interesting.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.544
The idea is called the social impact bond.

00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:48.921
Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.560
if we can get the government to agree,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.311
that we can create a contract where

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.770
they only pay if it worked.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.939
So that means that they can try out new stuff

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.402
without the embarrassment

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:03.410
of having to pay if it didn't work,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.082
which for still quite a lot of bits of government,

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:06.429
that's a serious issue.

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.024
Now, many of you may have noticed

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:09.510
there's a problem at this point,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.724
and that is that it takes a long time to measure

00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:14.490
whether those outcomes have happened.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.706
So we have to raise some money.

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:20.153
We use the contract to raise money

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:22.377
from socially motivated investors.

00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:24.731
Socially motivated investors:

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.029
there's an interesting idea, right?

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.420
But actually, there's a lot of people who,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.653
if they're given the chance,

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:32.535
would love to invest in something

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.298
that does social good.

00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:37.271
And here's the opportunity.

00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:39.528
Do you want to also help government find

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:41.964
whether there's a better economic model,

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:44.340
not just leaving these guys to come out of prison

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.211
and waiting till they re-offend
and putting them back in again,

00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:48.768
but actually working with them

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.327
to move to a different path

00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:52.926
to end up with fewer crimes

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:54.941
and fewer victims?

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.452
So we find some investors,

00:02:57.452 --> 00:02:59.822
and they pay for a set of services,

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:02.087
and if those services are successful,

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:04.580
then they improve outcomes,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.221
and with those measured reductions in re-offending,

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:08.296
government saves money,

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:09.833
and with those savings,

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.287
they can pay outcomes.

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:14.463
And the investors do not just get their money back,

00:03:14.463 --> 00:03:16.471
but they make a return.

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:18.912
So in March 2010, we signed

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:20.932
the first social impact bond

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:22.759
with the Ministry of Justice

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.796
around Peterborough Prison.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.820
It was to work with 3,000 offenders

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.748
split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.

00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:32.737
Now, each of those cohorts

00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:34.568
would get measured over the two years

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:35.770
that they were coming out of prison.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.825
They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:40.370
six months to get through the court system,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.765
and then they would be compared to a group

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:44.833
taken from the police national computer,

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.660
as similar as possible,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.194
and we would get paid

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.983
providing we achieved a hurdle rate
of 10-percent reduction,

00:03:50.983 --> 00:03:54.541
for every conviction event that didn't happen.

00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:58.018
So we get paid for crimes saved.

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:02.122
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction

00:04:02.122 --> 00:04:03.807
across all three cohorts,

00:04:03.807 --> 00:04:06.947
then the investors get a seven and a half percent

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.090
annualized return on their investment,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.630
and if we do better than that,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.226
they can get up to 13 percent

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.759
annualized return on their investment,

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.877
which is okay.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:20.085
So everyone wins here, right?

00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:22.800
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.243
and they only pay if it works.

00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:27.655
Investors get two opportunities:

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.711
for the first time, they can invest in social change.

00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:32.742
Also, they make a reasonable return,

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:34.915
and they also know that

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.187
first investors in these kinds of things,

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:38.844
they're going to have to believers.

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.947
They're going to have to care in the social program,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.939
but if this builds a track record

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.387
over five or 10 years,

00:04:44.387 --> 00:04:46.451
then you can widen that investor community

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.907
as more people have confidence in the product.

00:04:48.907 --> 00:04:51.095
The service providers, well, for the first time,

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.954
they've got an opportunity to provide services

00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:56.181
and grow the evidence for what they're doing

00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:58.741
in a really constructive way and learn

00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:00.563
and demonstrate the value of what they're doing

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:02.582
over five or six years, not just one or two

00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:04.423
as often happens at the moment.

00:05:04.423 --> 00:05:07.901
Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.

00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:10.727
Now, the offenders, they also benefit.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.157
Instead of just coming out of the prison

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:14.081
with 46 pounds in their pocket,

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.580
half of them not knowing where they're spending

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.718
their first night out of jail,

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.637
actually, someone meets them in prison,

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.501
learns about their issues,

00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:24.420
meets them at the gate,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.173
takes them through to somewhere to stay,

00:05:27.173 --> 00:05:29.591
connects them to benefits,
connects them to employment,

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.659
drug rehabilitation, mental health,

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.389
whatever's needed.

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.068
So let's think of another example:

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:37.958
working with children in care.

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.582
Social impact bonds work great

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:42.243
for any area where there is at the moment

00:05:42.243 --> 00:05:44.642
very expensive provision that produces

00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:46.216
poor outcomes for people.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:48.130
So children in the state care

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.565
tend to do very badly.

00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:54.490
Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.389
of five GCSEs at 16,

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.859
against 58 percent of the wider population.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.518
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison

00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:05.559
have spent some time in care.

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.851
And even more worryingly,

00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:08.823
and this is a Home Office statistic,

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:10.723
70 percent of prostitutes

00:06:10.723 --> 00:06:12.907
have spent some time in care.

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:15.907
The state is not a great parent.

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:18.732
But there are great programs

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:21.744
for adolescents who are on the edge of care,

00:06:21.744 --> 00:06:23.620
and 30 percent of kids going into care

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.279
are adolescents.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.119
So we set up a program with Essex County Council

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.765
to test out intensive family therapeutic support

00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:34.805
for those families with adolescents

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:36.376
on the edge of the care system.

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:39.162
Essex only pays in the event

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:41.944
that it's saving them care costs.

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.708
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.966
That program started last month.

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:49.290
Others, around homelessness in London,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.170
around youth and employment and education

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.537
elsewhere in the country.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:57.892
There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,

00:06:57.892 --> 00:07:00.367
and amazing levels of interest in this idea

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:01.890
all over the world.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.605
So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:07.855
into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:11.035
Obama has suggested 300 million dollars

00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:14.568
in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:16.254
and structures to move it forward,

00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:17.745
and a lot of other countries

00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:19.962
are demonstrating considerable interest.

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:22.018
So what's caused this excitement?

00:07:22.018 --> 00:07:24.537
Why is this so different for people?

00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:27.029
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:28.247
is innovation.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:31.445
It enables testing of new ideas

00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:35.038
in a way that's less difficult for everybody.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.674
The second piece it brings is rigor.

00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:40.967
By working to outcomes, people really have to test

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:44.836
and bring data into the situation
that one's dealing with.

00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:47.338
So taking Peterborough as an example,

00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:49.561
we add case management

00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:52.217
across all of the different organizations
that we're working with

00:07:52.217 --> 00:07:53.502
so they know

00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:55.651
what actually has been done with different prisoners,

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:57.720
and at the same time they learn

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.146
from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.881
because we pushed for the data,

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.088
what actually happens, whether
they get re-arrested or not.

00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:07.376
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:10.313
And this leads to the third element, which is new,

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.415
and that's flexibility.

00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:15.528
Because normal contracting for things,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.589
when you're spending government money,

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:20.100
you're spending our money, tax money,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.797
and the people who are in charge 
of that are very aware of it

00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:26.647
so the temptation is to control
exactly how you spend it.

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:29.700
Now any entrepreneur in the room knows

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.797
that version 1.0, the business plan,

00:08:31.797 --> 00:08:34.644
is not the one that generally works.

00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:36.947
So when you're trying to do something like this,

00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:39.640
you need the flexibility to adapt the program.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.352
And again, in Peterborough, we started off

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:46.509
with a program, but we also collected data,

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:48.386
and over the period of time,

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:50.584
we nuanced and changed that program

00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:53.204
to add a range of other elements,

00:08:53.204 --> 00:08:54.969
so that the service adapts

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:57.470
and we meet the needs of the long term

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.534
as well as the short term:

00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:02.643
greater engagement from the prisoners,

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.422
longer-term engagement as well.

00:09:05.422 --> 00:09:07.958
The last element is partnership.

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.135
There is, at the moment, a stale 
debate going on very often:

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.260
state's better, public sector's better,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.771
private sector's better, social sector's better,

00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:18.439
for a lot of these programs.

00:09:18.439 --> 00:09:20.421
Actually, for creating social change,

00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:22.160
we need to bring in the expertise

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.856
from all of those parties

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.444
in order to make this work.

00:09:25.444 --> 00:09:27.487
And this creates a structure

00:09:27.487 --> 00:09:29.462
through which they can combine.

00:09:29.462 --> 00:09:31.394
So where does this leave us?

00:09:31.394 --> 00:09:33.228
This leaves us with a way

00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:36.215
that people can invest in social change.

00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:39.202
We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,

00:09:39.202 --> 00:09:41.635
who want the opportunity to invest in social change.

00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:44.724
We've met champions all over the public sector

00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:47.139
keen to make these kinds of differences.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:48.924
With this kind of model,

00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:50.860
we can help bring them together.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.822
Thank you.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:57.022
