00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Another is to change our lifestyles.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
can actually be measured now.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
This was figured out by Robin Williams

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
a few years before the rest of us.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Now, there's some things that you can do

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
to make your brain grow new brain cells.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
alcohol in moderation, stress management

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
I'm just the messenger.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
(Laughter)

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
What were we just talking about?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
(Laughter)

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
And other things that can make it worse,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
that can cause you to lose brain cells.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.160
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
Your heart gets more blood flow.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
after only a year become measurably less clogged.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
the blue means no blood flow.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
simply by making these changes.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
70 percent in the group that made these changes,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
These differences were highly significant.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
so you increase sexual potency.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
by the Department of Health Services,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
but it also causes impotence.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160
How sexy is that?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Now we're also about to publish a study --

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
This is what's called a heat map --

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
turning off the disease-promoting genes.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And so these findings I think are really very powerful,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
giving many people new hope and new choices.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
that are giving you your genetic profiles,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
than we might have made otherwise,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Thank you.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
(Applause)
