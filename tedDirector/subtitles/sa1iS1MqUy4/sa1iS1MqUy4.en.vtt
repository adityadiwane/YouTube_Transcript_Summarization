00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:23.081
There's so many of you.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:24.693
(Laughter)

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.532
When I was a kid,

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:33.040
I hid my heart under the bed,
because my mother said,

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:35.929
"If you're not careful,
someday someone's going to break it."

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:39.738
Take it from me: Under the bed
is not a good hiding spot.

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.693
I know because I've been
shot down so many times,

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:45.624
I get altitude sickness
just from standing up for myself.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.216
But that's what we were told.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.142
"Stand up for yourself."

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:53.872
And that's hard to do
if you don't know who you are.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:57.636
We were expected to define ourselves
at such an early age,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.398
and if we didn't do it,
others did it for us.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:02.463
Geek. Fatty.

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:04.232
Slut. Fag.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.887
And at the same time we were
being told what we were,

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.236
we were being asked,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.768
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:15.315
I always thought
that was an unfair question.

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.284
It presupposes that we can't be
what we already are.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.855
We were kids.

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.599
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.794
I wanted a registered
retirement savings plan

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.937
that would keep me in candy
long enough to make old age sweet.

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.142
(Laughter)

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.182
When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.444
Now, not so much.

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:35.895
(Laughter)

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:39.747
When I was eight,
I wanted to be a marine biologist.

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:41.676
When I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,"

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.613
and thought to myself, "No, thank you."

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.850
(Laughter)

00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:46.304
And when I was 10,

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:49.161
I was told that my parents left
because they didn't want me.

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:51.146
When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.519
When I was 12, I wanted to die.
When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:57.956
When I was 14, I was asked
to seriously consider a career path.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.281
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:03.304
And they said,
"Choose something realistic."

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.133
So I said, "Professional wrestler."

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.053
And they said, "Don't be stupid."

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.435
See, they asked me what I wanted to be,

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.197
then told me what not to be.

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:16.395
And I wasn't the only one.

00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:19.297
We were being told
that we somehow must become

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.284
what we are not, sacrificing what we are

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.696
to inherit the masquerade
of what we will be.

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:28.007
I was being told to accept the identity
that others will give me.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.952
And I wondered, what made
my dreams so easy to dismiss?

00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.264
Granted, my dreams are shy,

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.565
because they're Canadian.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.478
(Laughter)

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:44.145
My dreams are self-conscious
and overly apologetic.

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.804
They're standing alone
at the high school dance,

00:02:46.828 --> 00:02:48.280
and they've never been kissed.

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.630
See, my dreams got called names too.

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.314
Silly. Foolish.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.030
Impossible.

00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:57.317
But I kept dreaming.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.400
I was going to be a wrestler.
I had it all figured out.

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:02.044
I was going to be The Garbage Man.

00:03:02.068 --> 00:03:03.069
(Laughter)

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:06.522
My finishing move was going
to be The Trash Compactor.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:09.664
My saying was going to be,
"I'm taking out the trash!"

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.524
(Laughter)

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:16.300
(Applause)

00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:21.072
And then this guy,
Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:22.816
stole my entire shtick.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.407
(Laughter)

00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.533
I was crushed,

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:28.382
as if by a trash compactor.

00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:30.621
(Laughter)

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.452
I thought to myself,
"What now? Where do I turn?"

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:35.912
Poetry.

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:37.314
(Laughter)

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:40.316
Like a boomerang,
the thing I loved came back to me.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.499
One of the first lines of poetry
I can remember writing

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.143
was in response to a world
that demanded I hate myself.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.563
From age 15 to 18, I hated myself

00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:51.387
for becoming the thing that I loathed:

00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:52.584
a bully.

00:03:52.988 --> 00:03:55.752
When I was 19, I wrote,

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:58.301
"I will love myself
despite the ease with which

00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.149
I lean toward the opposite."

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:04.649
Standing up for yourself
doesn't have to mean

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:06.276
embracing violence.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.975
When I was a kid,

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.706
I traded in homework
assignments for friendship,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.729
then gave each friend a late slip
for never showing up on time,

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:16.379
and in most cases, not at all.

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:19.513
I gave myself a hall pass
to get through each broken promise.

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:21.864
And I remember this plan,
born out of frustration

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:24.083
from a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:27.109
then pointed at my tummy and said,
"Too many picnic baskets."

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:30.270
Turns out it's not that hard
to trick someone,

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:31.866
and one day before class, I said,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.935
"Yeah, you can copy my homework,"

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:37.910
and I gave him all the wrong answers
that I'd written down the night before.

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:40.440
He got his paper back
expecting a near-perfect score,

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:44.275
and couldn't believe it when he looked
across the room at me and held up a zero.

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:47.345
I knew I didn't have to hold up
my paper of 28 out of 30,

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:50.377
but my satisfaction was complete
when he looked at me, puzzled,

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:53.859
and I thought to myself, "Smarter
than the average bear, motherfucker."

00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:55.665
(Laughter)

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.919
(Applause)

00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:03.732
This is who I am.

00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:07.203
This is how I stand up for myself.

00:05:08.543 --> 00:05:10.793
When I was a kid,

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:14.729
I used to think that pork chops
and karate chops were the same thing.

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.468
I thought they were both pork chops.

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.629
My grandmother thought it was cute,

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.463
and because they were my favorite,
she let me keep doing it.

00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:23.940
Not really a big deal.

00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:27.723
One day, before I realized fat kids
are not designed to climb trees,

00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:30.901
I fell out of a tree
and bruised the right side of my body.

00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:32.977
I didn't want to tell my grandmother

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:34.871
because I was scared I'd get in trouble

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:37.002
for playing somewhere
I shouldn't have been.

00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:40.656
The gym teacher noticed the bruise,
and I got sent to the principal's office.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.959
From there, I was sent to another
small room with a really nice lady

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:46.832
who asked me all kinds of questions
about my life at home.

00:05:48.094 --> 00:05:49.451
I saw no reason to lie.

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.252
As far as I was concerned,
life was pretty good.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:56.194
I told her, whenever I'm sad,
my grandmother gives me karate chops.

00:05:56.218 --> 00:06:03.181
(Laughter)

00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:07.973
This led to a full-scale investigation,

00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:10.899
and I was removed
from the house for three days,

00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:13.784
until they finally decided
to ask how I got the bruises.

00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:17.605
News of this silly little story
quickly spread through the school,

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:19.268
and I earned my first nickname:

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:21.255
Porkchop.

00:06:22.156 --> 00:06:24.515
To this day,

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.441
I hate pork chops.

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:31.440
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:34.162
surrounded by people
who used to say that rhyme

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.598
about sticks and stones,

00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:39.366
as if broken bones hurt more
than the names we got called,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.877
and we got called them all.

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:44.886
So we grew up believing
no one would ever fall in love with us,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.215
that we'd be lonely forever,

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:49.951
that we'd never meet someone
to make us feel like the sun

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:52.333
was something they built
for us in their toolshed.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.182
So broken heartstrings bled the blues,

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:56.716
and we tried to empty ourselves
so we'd feel nothing.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.095
Don't tell me that hurts
less than a broken bone,

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.752
that an ingrown life
is something surgeons can cut away,

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:04.399
that there's no way
for it to metastasize; it does.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.125
She was eight years old,

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.967
our first day of grade three
when she got called ugly.

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.349
We both got moved to the back of class

00:07:11.373 --> 00:07:14.331
so we would stop
getting bombarded by spitballs.

00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:16.326
But the school halls were a battleground.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.879
We found ourselves outnumbered
day after wretched day.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:21.926
We used to stay inside for recess,
because outside was worse.

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:24.348
Outside, we'd have
to rehearse running away,

00:07:24.372 --> 00:07:27.765
or learn to stay still like statues,
giving no clues that we were there.

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:30.576
In grade five, they taped
a sign to the front of her desk

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.270
that read, "Beware of dog."

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.849
To this day,

00:07:34.873 --> 00:07:38.446
despite a loving husband,
she doesn't think she's beautiful,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.854
because of a birthmark that takes up
a little less than half her face.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.117
Kids used to say,
"She looks like a wrong answer

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.301
that someone tried to erase,
but couldn't quite get the job done."

00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:50.262
And they'll never understand
that she's raising two kids

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:54.397
whose definition of beauty
begins with the word "Mom,"

00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:56.875
because they see her heart
before they see her skin,

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:58.995
because she's only ever
always been amazing.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.938
He was a broken branch grafted
onto a different family tree,

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.851
adopted,

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.805
not because his parents opted
for a different destiny.

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.678
He was three when he became a mixed drink

00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:14.995
of one part left alone
and two parts tragedy,

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.177
started therapy in eighth grade,

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.005
had a personality
made up of tests and pills,

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:23.797
lived like the uphills were mountains
and the downhills were cliffs,

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:27.205
four-fifths suicidal,
a tidal wave of antidepressants,

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:30.115
and an adolescent being called "Popper,"

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.211
one part because of the pills,

00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:34.315
99 parts because of the cruelty.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.513
He tried to kill himself in grade 10

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:40.156
when a kid who could still
go home to Mom and Dad

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.980
had the audacity to tell him,
"Get over it."

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:46.028
As if depression is something
that could be remedied

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:48.694
by any of the contents
found in a first-aid kit.

00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:52.294
To this day, he is a stick of TNT
lit from both ends,

00:08:52.318 --> 00:08:54.821
could describe to you in detail
the way the sky bends

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:56.774
in the moment before it's about to fall,

00:08:56.798 --> 00:08:59.766
and despite an army of friends
who all call him an inspiration,

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.087
he remains a conversation piece
between people who can't understand

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:06.116
sometimes being drug-free
has less to do with addiction

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.342
and more to do with sanity.

00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:11.684
We weren't the only kids
who grew up this way.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.061
To this day, kids are still
being called names.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.603
The classics were
"Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."

00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:23.825
Seems like every school
has an arsenal of names

00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:25.463
getting updated every year.

00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:29.190
And if a kid breaks in a school
and no one around chooses to hear,

00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:30.564
do they make a sound?

00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:33.729
Are they just background noise
from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,

00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:36.969
when people say things like,
"Kids can be cruel."

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:41.013
Every school was a big top circus tent,

00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:43.852
and the pecking order
went from acrobats to lion tamers,

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:47.225
from clowns to carnies,
all of these miles ahead of who we were.

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:48.671
We were freaks --

00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:51.292
lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,

00:09:51.316 --> 00:09:53.402
oddities juggling
depression and loneliness,

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.155
playing solitaire, spin the bottle,

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:57.799
trying to kiss the wounded
parts of ourselves and heal,

00:09:57.823 --> 00:10:00.420
but at night, while the others slept,

00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:02.126
we kept walking the tightrope.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.324
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.901
But I want to tell them that all of this

00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:11.940
is just debris

00:10:11.964 --> 00:10:16.668
left over when we finally decide to smash
all the things we thought we used to be,

00:10:16.692 --> 00:10:20.612
and if you can't see anything
beautiful about yourself,

00:10:20.636 --> 00:10:25.319
get a better mirror, look
a little closer, stare a little longer,

00:10:25.343 --> 00:10:28.260
because there's something inside you
that made you keep trying

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:30.184
despite everyone who told you to quit.

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.251
You built a cast around your broken heart

00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:34.316
and signed it yourself, "They were wrong."

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.943
Because maybe you didn't belong
to a group or a clique.

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:40.024
Maybe they decided to pick you last
for basketball or everything.

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:43.908
Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken
teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,

00:10:43.932 --> 00:10:45.655
because how can you hold your ground

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:48.110
if everyone around you
wants to bury you beneath it?

00:10:48.134 --> 00:10:50.093
You have to believe that they were wrong.

00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:53.139
They have to be wrong.

00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:56.624
Why else would we still be here?

00:10:58.028 --> 00:11:00.349
We grew up learning
to cheer on the underdog

00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:02.191
because we see ourselves in them.

00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:05.235
We stem from a root planted in the belief

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:07.206
that we are not what we were called.

00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:12.273
We are not abandoned cars stalled out
and sitting empty on some highway,

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.192
and if in some way we are, don't worry.

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:16.209
We only got out to walk and get gas.

00:11:16.233 --> 00:11:19.512
We are graduating members
from the class of We Made It,

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:21.536
not the faded echoes of voices crying out,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.316
"Names will never hurt me."

00:11:26.274 --> 00:11:29.139
Of course they did.

00:11:30.846 --> 00:11:34.464
But our lives will only ever always
continue to be a balancing act

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:37.543
that has less to do with pain

00:11:38.853 --> 00:11:40.228
and more to do with beauty.

00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:49.663
(Applause)
