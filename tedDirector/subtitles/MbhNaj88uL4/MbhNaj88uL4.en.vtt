00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:30.260
(Music)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
What you just heard

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Every single bead, every single colored band,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
represents a weather element

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that can also be read as a musical note.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I find weather extremely fascinating.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Weather is an amalgam of systems

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that is inherently invisible to most of us.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So I use sculpture and music

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
to make it, not just visible,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
but also tactile and audible.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
All of my work begins very simple.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I extract information from a specific environment

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
using very low-tech data collecting devices --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
generally anything I can find in the hardware store.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
satellite images, weather data

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
That's both historical as well as real data.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
These clipboards are filled with numbers.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And from all of these numbers,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
I start with only two or three variables.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
That begins my translation process.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
My translation medium is a very simple basket.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I can use the changes of those data points over time

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to create the form.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I use natural reed,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
because natural reed has a lot of tension in it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that I cannot fully control.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
That means that it is the numbers that control the form,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
not me.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
What I come up with are forms like these.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
These forms are completely made up

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
of weather data or science data.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Every colored bead, every colored string,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
represents a weather element.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And together, these elements, not only construct the form,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
but they also reveal behavioral relationships

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
that may not come across

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
through a two-dimensional graph.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
When you step closer, you actually see

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
that it is indeed all made up of numbers.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
The vertical elements

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
are assigned a specific hour of the day.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
But it's also used to assign a temperature range.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I also translate weather data into musical scores.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
of translating information

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
without compromising it.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So all of these scores are made up of weather data.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Every single color, dot, every single line,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
is a weather element.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And together, these variables construct a score.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
This is the 1913 Trio

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
performing one of my pieces

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at the Milwaukee Art Museum.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
to translate into sculptural forms like this,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that function still in the sense

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
of being a three-dimensional weather visualization,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
but now they're embedding

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the visual matrix of the musical score,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
so it can actually be read as a musical score.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
What I love about this work

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
is that it challenges our assumptions

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
This piece here is read very differently

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
depending on where you place it.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
You place it in a science museum,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
You place it in a music hall,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
And I really like that,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
because the viewer is really challenged

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
as to what visual language

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
is part of science versus art versus music.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
The other reason why I really like this

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is because it offers an alternative entry point

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
into the complexity of science.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So for me, that was my way into it.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Thank you.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
(Applause)
