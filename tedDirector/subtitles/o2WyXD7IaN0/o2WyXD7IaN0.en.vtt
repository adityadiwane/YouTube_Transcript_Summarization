00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
How would you like to be better than you are?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Suppose I said

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that, with just a few changes in your genes,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
you could get a better memory --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
more precise,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
more accurate and quicker.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
with more stamina.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
How about living longer with good health?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Or perhaps you're one of those

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
who's always yearned for more creativity.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Which one would you like the most?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Which would you like, if you could have just one?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
(Audience Member: Creativity.)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Creativity.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
How many people would choose creativity?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Raise your hands. Let me see.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
(Laughter) That's very good.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
How many would opt for memory?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Quite a few more.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
How about fitness?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
A few less.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
What about longevity?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
If you could have any one of these,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
it would be a very different world.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Is it just imaginary?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Evolution has been a perennial topic

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
here at the TED Conference,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
but I want to give you today

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
one doctor's take on the subject.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
The great 20th-century geneticist,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
T.G. Dobzhansky,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
who was also a communicant

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in the Russian Orthodox Church,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
once wrote an essay that he titled

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Except in the Light of Evolution."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Now if you are one of those

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
take out your personal communications device --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I give you permission --

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
because nothing in the rest of this talk

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
(Laughter)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But if you do accept

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
biological evolution,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
consider this:

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is it just about the past,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
or is it about the future?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Does it apply to others,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
or does it apply to us?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
This is another look at the tree of life.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
In this picture,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
because if you look at the edges

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
of the tree of life,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
every existing species

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
at the tips of those branches

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
has succeeded in evolutionary terms:

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
it has survived;

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
it has demonstrated a fitness

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to its environment.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
The human part of this branch,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
way out on one end,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
We branch off of a common ancestor

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
to modern chimpanzees

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
about six or eight million years ago.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
In the interval,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
there have been perhaps 20 or 25

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
different species of hominids.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Some have come and gone.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
We have been here for about 130,000 years.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
It may seem like we're quite remote

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
from other parts of this tree of life,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
but actually, for the most part,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
the basic machinery of our cells

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
is pretty much the same.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Do you realize that we can take advantage

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
to produce the protein of human insulin

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
used to treat diabetics?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
This is not like human insulin;

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
this is the same protein

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that is chemically indistinguishable

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
from what comes out of your pancreas.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And speaking of bacteria,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
do you realize that each of us carries in our gut

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
more bacteria

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
than there are cells in the rest of our body?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Maybe 10 times more.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I mean think of it,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
do you think about the bacteria?

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
for those bacteria.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
it's very cozy.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
with no effort on their part.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
with the occasional interruption

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
of the unintended forced rush to the exit.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
But otherwise,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
just as they are essential to your life.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and they protect you against certain diseases.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
But what will come in the future?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
as a species?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Or, are we destined

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
to become something different --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
something, perhaps, even better adapted

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
to the environment?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Now let's take a step back in time

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
the Earth, the solar system,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
about four and a half billion years --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
the first signs of proto-life,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
the first multi-celled organisms,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
perhaps as much

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
as 800 or a billion years ago --

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and then the human species,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
finally emerging

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
in the last 130,000 years.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
life on Earth is like a brief measure;

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
the animal kingdom,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
like a single measure;

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and human life,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
a small grace note.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
That was us.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
so I hope you enjoyed it.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
(Laughter)

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Now when I was a freshman in college,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
I took my first biology class.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I was fascinated

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
by the elegance and beauty of biology.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I became enamored of the power of evolution,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and I realized something very fundamental:

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
in most of the existence of life

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in single-celled organisms,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
each cell simply divides,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and all of the genetic energy of that cell

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is carried on in both daughter cells.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
things start to change.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And very importantly,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
with the introduction of sexual reproduction

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that passes on the genome,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
the rest of the body

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
becomes expendable.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
In fact, you could say

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that the inevitability of the death of our bodies

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
enters in evolutionary time

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
at the same moment

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
as sexual reproduction.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Now I have to confess,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
when I was a college undergraduate,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
but with each passing year,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I've come to have increasing doubts.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
who was performing still in Las Vegas

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
well into his 90s.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
He answers the door.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
She looks at him and says,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
"I'm here for super sex."

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
(Laughter)

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I came to realize,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
as a physician,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
that I was working toward a goal

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
which was different from the goal of evolution --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
not necessarily contradictory, just different.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
I was trying to preserve the body.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
I wanted to keep us healthy.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I wanted to restore health from disease.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Evolution is all about passing on the genome

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to the next generation,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
adapting and surviving

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
through generation after generation.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
From an evolutionary point of view,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
you and I are like the booster rockets

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
designed to send the genetic payload

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
into the next level of orbit

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and then drop off into the sea.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
I want to achieve it through not dying."

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
(Laughter)

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Evolution does not necessarily

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
favor the longest-lived.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
or the strongest or the fastest,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and not even the smartest.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Evolution favors

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
those creatures best adapted

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
to their environment.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
That is the sole test

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
of survival and success.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
At the bottom of the ocean,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
bacteria that are thermophilic

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and can survive at the steam vent heat

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
sous-vide cooked fish,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
nevertheless, have managed

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260
to make that a hospitable environment for them.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So what does this mean,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
as we look back at what has happened in evolution,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and as we think about the place again

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
of humans in evolution,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and particularly as we look ahead

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
to the next phase,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
I would say

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
that there are a number of possibilities.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.260
The first is that we will not evolve.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
We have reached

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
a kind of equipoise.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And the reasoning behind that would be,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
first, we have, through medicine,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
managed to preserve a lot of genes

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that would otherwise be selected out

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and be removed from the population.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And secondly, we as a species

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
have so configured our environment

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that we have managed to make it adapt to us

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
as well as we adapt to it.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and intermix so much

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that you can't any longer

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
have the isolation that is necessary

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
for evolution to take place.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
A second possibility

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.260
natural, imposed by the forces of nature.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And the argument here would be

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
but they are inexorable.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And as far as isolation goes,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
when we as a species

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
do colonize distant planets,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
there will be the isolation and the environmental changes

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
that could produce evolution

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
in the natural way.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But there's a third possibility,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I call it neo-evolution --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
the new evolution

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
that is not simply natural,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
but guided and chosen

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
by us as individuals

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
in the choices that we will make.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Now how could this come about?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
How could it be possible that we would do this?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Consider, first, the reality

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
that people today, in some cultures,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
are making choices about their offspring.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
They're, in some cultures,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
choosing to have more males than females.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
It's not necessarily good for the society,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Think also,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
if it were possible ever

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
but for you in your body

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
to make the genetic adjustments

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
that would cure or prevent diseases.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
What if you could make the genetic changes

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
or reduce the risk of cancer

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
or eliminate stroke?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Wouldn't you want

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
to make those changes

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
in your genes?

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
If we look ahead,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
these kind of changes

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.260
are going to be increasingly possible.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
The Human Genome Project

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
started in 1990,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and it took 13 years.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.260
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
The year after it was finished in 2004,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
you could do the same job

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
for 20 million dollars in three to four months.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Today, you can have a complete sequence

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
of the three billion base pairs in the human genome

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
at a cost of about 20,000 dollars

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and in the space of about a week.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
It won't be very long

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
before the reality will be

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
the 1,000-dollar human genome,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and it will be increasingly available for everyone.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Just a week ago,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
the National Academy of Engineering

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
awarded its Draper Prize

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.260
two scientists who independently developed techniques

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and to lead to desirable proteins

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
in a more efficient way --

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution."

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
for his research

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in which he took an adult skin cell,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
a fibroblast,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and by manipulating just four genes,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
he induced that cell

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.260
to revert to a pluripotential stem cell --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
a cell potentially capable

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
of becoming any cell in your body.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
These changes are coming.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
The same technology

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
that has produced the human insulin in bacteria

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
can make viruses

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
that will not only protect you against themselves,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
but induce immunity against other viruses.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Believe it or not,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
there's an experimental trial going on

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
with vaccine against influenza

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
These are all reality today,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
Imagine then

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
just two other little changes.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
You can change the cells in your body,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.260
but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
What if you could change the sperm and the ova,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
or change the newly fertilized egg,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and give your offspring a better chance

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
at a healthier life --

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
reduce the risk of cancer?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
Who doesn't want healthier children?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And then, that same analytic technology,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
that same engine of science

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that can produce

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
the changes to prevent disease,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
will also enable us

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
to adopt super-attributes,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
hyper-capacities --

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that better memory.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Why not have the quick wit

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
of a Ken Jennings,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
especially if you can augment it

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
with the next generation of the Watson machine?

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Why not have the quick twitch muscle

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
that will enable you to run faster and longer?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Why not live longer?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
These will be irresistible.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
And when we are at a position

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
where we can pass it on to the next generation,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and we can adopt the attributes we want,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
we will have converted

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
old-style evolution

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
into neo-evolution.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
We'll take a process

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
that normally might require 100,000 years,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and we can compress it down to a thousand years --

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and maybe even in the next 100 years.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
These are choices

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
that your grandchildren,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
or their grandchildren,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
are going to have before them.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
Will we use these choices

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
to make a society that is better,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
that is more successful, that is kinder?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that we want for some of us

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
and not for others of us?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Will we make a society

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
that is more boring and more uniform,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
or more robust and more versatile?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
These are the kinds of questions

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that we will have to face.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
And most profoundly of all,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
and to inherit the wisdom,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
that we'll need to make these choices wisely?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
For better or worse,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
and sooner than you may think,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
these choices will be up to us.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
Thank you.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:14.260
(Applause)
