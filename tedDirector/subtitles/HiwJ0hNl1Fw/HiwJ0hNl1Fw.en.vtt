00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:14.316
I once said,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.483
"If you want to liberate a society,

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:19.523
all you need is the Internet."

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:21.415
I was wrong.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.701
I said those words back in 2011,

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.647
when a Facebook page I anonymously created

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:29.986
helped spark the Egyptian revolution.

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:35.304
The Arab Spring revealed
social media's greatest potential,

00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:39.336
but it also exposed
its greatest shortcomings.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:44.023
The same tool that united us
to topple dictators

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:47.229
eventually tore us apart.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.124
I would like to share my own experience
in using social media for activism,

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:56.679
and talk about some of the challenges
I have personally faced

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:58.528
and what we could do about them.

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:01.580
In the early 2000s,

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.219
Arabs were flooding the web.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.580
Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:12.316
for connecting with the rest
of the people around the globe,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.027
we escaped our frustrating
political realities

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.699
and lived a virtual, alternative life.

00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:26.026
Just like many of them,
I was completely apolitical until 2009.

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:30.344
At the time, when I logged
into social media,

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:32.888
I started seeing more and more Egyptians

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:35.657
aspiring for political change
in the country.

00:01:36.244 --> 00:01:38.894
It felt like I was not alone.

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:42.284
In June 2010,

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:45.712
Internet changed my life forever.

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:49.532
While browsing Facebook,

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:54.815
I saw a photo, a terrifying photo,
of a tortured, dead body

00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:57.373
of a young Egyptian guy.

00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.016
His name was Khaled Said.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.361
Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian
who was killed by police.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.012
I saw myself in his picture.

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:12.004
I thought, "I could be Khaled."

00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:16.923
I could not sleep that night,
and I decided to do something.

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.043
I anonymously created a Facebook page

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:23.407
and called it "We are all Khaled Said."

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:29.270
In just three days, the page
had over 100,000 people,

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.898
fellow Egyptians who shared
the same concern.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.790
Whatever was happening had to stop.

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:39.401
I recruited my co-admin,
AbdelRahman Mansour.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.932
We worked together for hours and hours.

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.884
We were crowdsourcing
ideas from the people.

00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:47.352
We were engaging them.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.940
We were calling collectively for actions,

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:53.860
and sharing news that the regime
did not want Egyptians to know.

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:57.697
The page became the most followed page

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.124
in the Arab world.

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:03.502
It had more fans than established
media organizations

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:05.301
and even top celebrities.

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:08.936
On January 14, 2011,

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.088
Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia

00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:14.866
after mounting protests
against his regime.

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.462
I saw a spark of hope.

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:21.326
Egyptians on social media were wondering,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.691
"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:26.907
I posted an event
on Facebook and called it

00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:31.738
"A Revolution against Corruption,
Injustice and Dictatorship."

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:37.142
I posed a question to the 300,000 users
of the page at the time:

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.301
"Today is the 14th of January.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.220
The 25th of January is Police Day.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.259
It's a national holiday.

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:50.227
If 100,000 of us take
to the streets of Cairo,

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.006
no one is going to stop us.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.802
I wonder if we could do it."

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:59.279
In just a few days, the invitation
reached over a million people,

00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:03.033
and over 100,000 people
confirmed attendance.

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.903
Social media was crucial
for this campaign.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.531
It helped a decentralized movement arise.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.499
It made people realize
that they were not alone.

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:15.753
And it made it impossible
for the regime to stop it.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.050
At the time, they didn't
even understand it.

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:25.889
And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded
the streets of Cairo and other cities,

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.887
calling for change,

00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:30.206
breaking the barrier of fear

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.129
and announcing a new era.

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:35.552
Then came the consequences.

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:41.371
A few hours before the regime cut off
the Internet and telecommunications,

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:45.343
I was walking in a dark street
in Cairo, around midnight.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:49.034
I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:52.529
The government must be planning
a massacre tomorrow."

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:55.835
I was hit hard on my head.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.699
I lost my balance and fell down,

00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:02.223
to find four armed men surrounding me.

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:05.918
One covered my mouth
and the others paralyzed me.

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:09.796
I knew I was being kidnapped
by state security.

00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:12.930
I found myself in a cell,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.389
handcuffed, blindfolded.

00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:18.251
I was terrified.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:19.939
So was my family,

00:05:20.956 --> 00:05:22.581
who started looking for me

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:25.512
in hospitals, police stations
and even morgues.

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:27.840
After my disappearance,

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:31.253
a few of my fellow colleagues who knew
I was the admin of the page

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:35.476
told the media about
my connection with that page,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.422
and that I was likely arrested
by state security.

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.572
My colleagues at Google started
a search campaign trying to find me,

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:47.578
and the fellow protesters in the square
demanded my release.

00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:50.540
After 11 days of complete darkness,

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:51.784
I was set free.

00:05:52.516 --> 00:05:54.128
And three days later,

00:05:54.152 --> 00:05:56.714
Mubarak was forced to step down.

00:05:57.505 --> 00:06:01.649
It was the most inspiring
and empowering moment of my life.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.225
It was a time of great hope.

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.914
Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days
during the revolution.

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.557
They all shared the belief

00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:15.873
that we could actually live together
despite our differences,

00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:18.353
that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:20.514
But unfortunately,

00:06:20.538 --> 00:06:24.973
the post-revolution events
were like a punch in the gut.

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:27.988
The euphoria faded,

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.663
we failed to build consensus,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.250
and the political struggle
led to intense polarization.

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.602
Social media only amplified that state,

00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:42.295
by facilitating the spread
of misinformation, rumors,

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.165
echo chambers and hate speech.

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.549
The environment was purely toxic.

00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:54.379
My online world became a battleground
filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.329
I started to worry
about the safety of my family.

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:02.032
But of course, this wasn't just about me.

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:07.515
The polarization reached its peak
between the two main powers --

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.327
the army supporters and the Islamists.

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:13.394
People in the center, like me,

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:15.118
started feeling helpless.

00:07:16.587 --> 00:07:19.087
Both groups wanted you to side with them;

00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:21.362
you were either with them or against them.

00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:24.639
And on the 3rd of July 2013,

00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:29.170
the army ousted Egypt's first
democratically elected president,

00:07:29.194 --> 00:07:33.765
after three days of popular protest
that demanded his resignation.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:37.214
That day I made a very hard decision.

00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:41.535
I decided to go silent, completely silent.

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:43.775
It was a moment of defeat.

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:47.905
I stayed silent for more than two years,

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:50.831
and I used the time to reflect
on everything that happened,

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:53.881
trying to understand why did it happen.

00:07:54.773 --> 00:07:56.218
It became clear to me

00:07:56.242 --> 00:08:01.163
that while it's true that polarization
is primarily driven

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:03.022
by our human behavior,

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:07.490
social media shapes this behavior
and magnifies its impact.

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:11.406
Say you want to say something
that is not based on a fact,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.142
pick a fight or ignore
someone that you don't like.

00:08:14.914 --> 00:08:17.621
These are all natural human impulses,

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.800
but because of technology,

00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:23.248
acting on these impulses
is only one click away.

00:08:24.562 --> 00:08:27.505
In my view, there are five
critical challenges

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:29.847
facing today's social media.

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:33.892
First, we don't know
how to deal with rumors.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:37.219
Rumors that confirm people's biases

00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:41.320
are now believed and spread
among millions of people.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.040
Second, we create our own echo chambers.

00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:49.912
We tend to only communicate
with people that we agree with,

00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:52.100
and thanks to social media,

00:08:52.124 --> 00:08:56.725
we can mute, un-follow
and block everybody else.

00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:03.067
Third, online discussions
quickly descend into angry mobs.

00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.258
All of us probably know that.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.627
It's as if we forget

00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.911
that the people behind screens
are actually real people

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:12.450
and not just avatars.

00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:17.636
And fourth, it became really hard
to change our opinions.

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.593
Because of the speed
and brevity of social media,

00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:24.551
we are forced to jump to conclusions

00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:27.639
and write sharp opinions in 140 characters

00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:29.847
about complex world affairs.

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:34.252
And once we do that,
it lives forever on the Internet,

00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:37.379
and we are less motivated
to change these views,

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:39.434
even when new evidence arises.

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:43.590
Fifth -- and in my point of view,
this is the most critical --

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:48.550
today, our social media experiences
are designed in a way

00:09:48.574 --> 00:09:51.511
that favors broadcasting over engagements,

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:53.554
posts over discussions,

00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:57.258
shallow comments over deep conversations.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.814
It's as if we agreed that
we are here to talk at each other

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:04.094
instead of talking with each other.

00:10:05.244 --> 00:10:07.680
I witnessed how these
critical challenges contributed

00:10:07.704 --> 00:10:11.017
to an already polarized
Egyptian society,

00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.154
but this is not just about Egypt.

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:16.803
Polarization is on the rise
in the whole world.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.899
We need to work hard on figuring out

00:10:19.923 --> 00:10:23.244
how technology could be
part of the solution,

00:10:23.268 --> 00:10:25.278
rather than part of the problem.

00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.412
There's a lot of debate today
on how to combat online harassment

00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:31.658
and fight trolls.

00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:33.460
This is so important.

00:10:33.818 --> 00:10:35.671
No one could argue against that.

00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:41.468
But we need to also think about how
to design social media experiences

00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:44.671
that promote civility
and reward thoughtfulness.

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.882
I know for a fact

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:50.122
if I write a post
that is more sensational,

00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:53.657
more one-sided, sometimes
angry and aggressive,

00:10:53.681 --> 00:10:56.452
I get to have more people see that post.

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.480
I will get more attention.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.990
But what if we put more focus on quality?

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:04.374
What is more important:

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:07.051
the total number of readers
of a post you write,

00:11:07.075 --> 00:11:11.696
or who are the people who have impact
that read what you write?

00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:17.212
Couldn't we just give people more
incentives to engage in conversations,

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:19.903
rather than just broadcasting
opinions all the time?

00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:22.186
Or reward people for reading

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.566
and responding to views
that they disagree with?

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:30.795
And also, make it socially acceptable
that we change our minds,

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:32.511
or probably even reward that?

00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:37.492
What if we have a matrix that says
how many people changed their minds,

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:40.672
and that becomes part
of our social media experience?

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:44.283
If I could track how many people
are changing their minds,

00:11:44.307 --> 00:11:48.008
I'd probably write more
thoughtfully, trying to do that,

00:11:48.032 --> 00:11:51.737
rather than appealing to the people
who already agree with me

00:11:51.761 --> 00:11:54.322
and "liking" because I just
confirmed their biases.

00:11:55.512 --> 00:11:59.168
We also need to think about effective
crowdsourcing mechanisms,

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:02.917
to fact-check widely spread
online information,

00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:05.231
and reward people who take part in that.

00:12:05.924 --> 00:12:10.861
In essence, we need to rethink
today's social media ecosystem

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:13.140
and redesign its experiences

00:12:13.164 --> 00:12:16.906
to reward thoughtfulness, civility
and mutual understanding.

00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:20.843
As a believer in the Internet,
I teamed up with a few friends,

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:22.350
started a new project,

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:26.179
trying to find answers
and explore possibilities.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.169
Our first product is a new
media platform for conversations.

00:12:30.977 --> 00:12:34.239
We're hosting conversations
that promote mutual understanding

00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:36.018
and hopefully change minds.

00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:38.144
We don't claim to have the answers,

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:42.144
but we started experimenting
with different discussions

00:12:42.168 --> 00:12:44.231
about very divisive issues,

00:12:44.255 --> 00:12:48.402
such as race, gun control,
the refugee debate,

00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:50.749
relationship between Islam and terrorism.

00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:53.701
These are conversations that matter.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:59.786
Today, at least one out of three
people on the planet

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.580
have access to the Internet.

00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:06.026
But part of this Internet
is being held captive

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.687
by the less noble aspects
of our human behavior.

00:13:10.774 --> 00:13:12.748
Five years ago, I said,

00:13:13.148 --> 00:13:15.769
"If you want to liberate society,

00:13:16.943 --> 00:13:18.555
all you need is the Internet."

00:13:19.207 --> 00:13:24.242
Today, I believe if we want
to liberate society,

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:26.701
we first need to liberate the Internet.

00:13:27.193 --> 00:13:28.361
Thank you very much.

00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:33.043
