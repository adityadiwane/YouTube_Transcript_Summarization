00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
For a moment, what I need to do

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is project something on the screen of your imagination.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
We're in 17th century Japan

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
on the west coast,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and a little, wizened monk

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
is hurrying along, near midnight,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to the crest of a small hill.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
He arrives on the small hill,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
dripping with water.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
He stands there,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and he looks across at the island, Sado.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Then he says to himself, very quietly,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
"[Turbulent the sea,]

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
[Stretching across to Sado]

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
[The Milky Way]."

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Basho was a brilliant man.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
He said more with less

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
than any human

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
that I have ever read or talked to.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Basho, in 17 syllables,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
juxtaposed

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
a turbulent ocean

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
driven by a storm now past,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and captured the almost

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
impossible beauty

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of our home galaxy

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
with millions of stars,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
maybe even an ocean

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that we will probably call Sylvia in time.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
As he was nearing his death,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
his disciples and followers

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
kept asking him,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
"What's the secret?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
How can you

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And toward the end, he said,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
"If you would know the pine tree,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
go to the pine tree."

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
That was it.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
(Laughter)

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Sylvia has said we must use

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
every capacity we have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
in order to know the oceans.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
If we would know the oceans,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
we must go to the oceans.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is really transforming

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
the relationship, or the interplay,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
between humans and oceans

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
with a new capability

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that is not at all routine yet.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I hope it will be.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
There are a few key points.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
One of them is the oceans are central

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
to the quality of life on earth.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Another is that there are bold, new ways

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
of studying oceans

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
that we have not used well yet.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And the last is that these bold, new ways

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
that we are exploring

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
as a community

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and eventually how we manage

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
probably the entire planet, for what it's worth.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So what scientists do when they begin

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
is to start with the system.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
They define what the system is.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
It's the whole planet,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the entire planet, continents and oceans together.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
That's the system.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And basically, our challenge

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
is to optimize the benefits

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and mitigate the risks

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
two sources of energy,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
one of which is solar,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
that drives the winds, the waves,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
The second one is internal energy.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And these two war against one another

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
almost continuously.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
moves the continents around, forms ore deposits.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Volcanoes erupt.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
That's the planet that we live on.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It's immensely complex.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
but what I want you to see is

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
this is about 10 percent

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
of the processes that operate within

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
the oceans almost continuously,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and have for the last 4 billion years.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
This is a system that's been around a very long time.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And these have all co-evolved.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
What do I mean by that?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
They interact with one another constantly.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
All of them interact with one another.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
So the complexity of this system that we're looking at,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
the one driven by the sun --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
upper portion, mostly --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and the lower portion is partly driven

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
by the input from heat below

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and by other processes.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
This is very, very important

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
because this is the system, this is the crucible,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
out of which life on the planet came,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and it's now time for us to understand it.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
We must understand it.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
understand this ocean of ours,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
this basic life support system,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
the dominant life support system on the planet.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Look at this complexity here.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
This is only one variable.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
If you can see the complexity,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
you can see how

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
tiny, little eddies

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and large eddies and the motion --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
this is just sea surface temperature,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
but it's immensely complicated.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Now a layer in,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
the other two or three hundred processes

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
that are all interacting,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
partly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and you've got a really complicated system.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
That's our challenge, is to understand,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
understand this system in new and phenomenal ways.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And there's an urgency to this.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Part of the urgency comes from the fact

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
are undernourished or starving.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And part of the issue

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
is for Cody --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
who's here,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
16 years old --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and I have permission to relay this number.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
When he, 40 years from now,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
is the age of Nancy Brown,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
there are going to be

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
another two and a half billion people on the planet.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
We can't solve all the problems

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
by looking only at the oceans,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
but if we don't understand

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
the fundamental life support system of this planet

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
much more thoroughly than we do now,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
then the stresses that we will face,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and that Cody will face,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
will have really problems coping.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
All right, let's talk about another perspective

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
on the importance of the oceans.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Look at this diagram, which is showing

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
warm waters in red,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
cool waters in blue,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
is the growth of vegetation,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
from 1982 to 1998

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and then cycling again.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
What you'll see is that the rhythms

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
of growth, of vegetation --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
a subset of which is food on the continents --

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
is directly tied to the rhythms

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
of the sea surface temperatures.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
The oceans control,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
or at least significantly influence,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
correlate with,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the growth patterns and the drought patterns

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and the rain patterns on the continents.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
need to understand that the oceans

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
are central to them as well.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I'm going to layer in on top of this

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
the tectonic plates.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
gives rise to a totally new phenomenon

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
that we have heard about

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
in this conference.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And I share with you some very high-definition video

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that we collected in real time.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Seconds after this video was taken,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
people in Beijing,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
people in Washington D.C. were watching this.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
but the other discovery

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
is that deep below the sea floor,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
there is vast reservoir of microbial activity,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
which we have only just discovered

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and we have almost no way to study.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Some people have estimated

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that the biomass

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
tied up in these microbes

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
living in the pours and the cracks

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
of the sea floor and below

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
rival the total amount of living biomass

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
at the surface of the planet.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
It's an astonishing insight,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
and we have only found out about this recently.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
This is very, very exciting.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
It may be the next rainforest,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
in terms of pharmaceuticals.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
We know little or nothing about it.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that, "The real voyage of discovery

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
consists not so much in seeking new territory,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
but possibly in having new sets of eyes,"

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
new ways of seeing things,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
a new mindset.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And many of you remember

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
the early stages of oceanography,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
when we had to use what we had at our fingertips.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Some of you remember this, I'm sure.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And now, we have an entire suite of tools

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
that are really pretty powerful --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
ships, satellites, moorings.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
just a little bit here,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
like the one running across the base of this image.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Modeling: on the right hand side,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
there's a very complex computational model.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
which I'll show you in just a second.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And on the basis

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
of several points,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And the models that we need to predict the future

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
do not have enough data to refine them.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
The computational power

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
is amazing.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
But without data, those models

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
will never ever be predicted.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And that's what we really need.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
For a variety of reasons they're dangerous,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but we feel that OOI,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
this Ocean Observatory Initiative,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
which the National Science Foundation

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
has begun to fund,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
has the potential to really transform things.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And the goal of the program is to

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
launch an era of scientific discovery

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and understanding

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
across and within the ocean basins,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
utilizing widely accessible,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
interactive telepresence.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
It's a new world.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
We will be present throughout

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
the volume of the ocean, at will,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
communicating in real time.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And this is what the system involves,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
a number of sites in the southern hemisphere,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
shown in those circles.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
I won't talk a lot about most of them right here,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
but the one on the west coast, that's in the box,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
is called the regional scale nodes.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It was once called Neptune.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And let me show you what's behind it.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
You can see the copper tips on these things.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
You can transmit power,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
but the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
smaller than the hair on your head in diameter.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And this particular set here

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
can transmit something of the order of

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
three to five terabits per second.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
This is phenomenal bandwidth.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And this is what the planet looks like.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
We are already laced up

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
This is what it looks like.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And the cables go really continent to continent.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
It's a very powerful system,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and most of our communications consist of it.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
So this is the system that I'm talking about,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And it's going to deliver abundant power

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and unprecedented bandwidth

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
across this entire volume --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
in the overlying ocean,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
on the sea floor and below the sea floor.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
Bandwidth and power

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
and a wide variety of processes

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
that will be operating.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
This is what one of those primary nodes looks like,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And the kind of science that can be done

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and can bring the instrumentation to the table.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
They will bring it and link it in.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
except you'll have your own port.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Climate change, ocean acidification,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
dissolved oxygen,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
carbon cycle, coastal upwelling,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
fishing dynamics --

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
the full spectrum of

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
earth science and ocean science

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
simultaneously in the same volume.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So anyone coming along later

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
simply accesses the database

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and can draw down the information they need

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
about anything that has taken place.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And this is just the first of these.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Now I want to take you into the caldera.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
On the left hand side there

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
is a large volcano called Axial Seamount.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
using animation.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Here's what this system is going to look like

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that we are funded to build at this point.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Very powerful.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
but it can be controlled by the folks on land

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
who are responsible for it.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Or they can transfer control

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to someone in India or China

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
who can take over for a while,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
because it's all going to be directly connected

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
through the Internet.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
all available to anyone who has any interest in using it.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
This is going to be much more powerful

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
than having a single ship

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
in a single location,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
then move to a new location.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
We're flying across the caldera floor.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
There is a number of robotic systems.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
if those are your experiments.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
The kinds of systems that will be down there,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
consist of -- if you can read them there --

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
there's cameras, there's pressure sensors,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
fluorometers, there's seismometers.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It's a full spectrum of tools.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Now, that mound right there

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
actually looks like this.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
This is what it actually looks like.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And this is the kind of activity

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
that we can see with high-definition video,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
because the bandwidth of these cables

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is so huge

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
that we could have five to 10

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
stereo HD systems

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
running continuously

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Very, very powerful.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And these are the things that we're funded to do today.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
So what can we actually do tomorrow?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
We're about to ride the wave

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
of technological opportunity.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
There are emerging technologies throughout

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
the field around oceanography,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
which we will incorporate into oceanography,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
and through that convergence,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
we will transform oceanography into something even more magical.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Robotics systems are just incredible these days,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
absolutely incredible.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
into the ocean.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
It's smaller than a postage stamp,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and it can generate power just by being

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
attached to your shirt as you move.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Just as you move, it generates power.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
but stereo imaging at four times the definition

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
that we have in HD

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
will be routine within five years.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And this is the magic one.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
As a result of the human genome process,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
we are in a situation where

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
events that take place in the ocean --

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort --

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
can actually be sampled.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
We pump the fluid through one of these systems,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and we press the button,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and it's analyzed for the genomic character.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
And that's transmitted back to land immediately.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
So in the volume of the ocean,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
but the base of the food chain

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
will be transparent to us

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
with data on a continuous basis.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Grid computing: the power of grid computers

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
is going to be just amazing here.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
We will soon be using grid computing

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and everything

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
that goes with the data.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
The power generation will come from the ocean itself.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
And the next generation fiber

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
will be simply magic.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
It's far beyond what we currently have.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
So the presence of the power

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and the bandwidth in the environment

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
will allow all of these new technologies

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
So within five to seven years,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
I see us having

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
a capacity to be completely present

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
throughout the ocean

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
and have all of that connected to the Internet,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
so we can reach many, many folks.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
will dramatically accelerate adaptation.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Here's an example.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
When earthquakes take place, massive amounts

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
of these new microbes we've never seen before

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
come out of the sea floor.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
We have a way of addressing that,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
a new way of addressing that.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
that the top of that volcano is erupting,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
so we deploy the troops.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
And they fly into the erupting volcano.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
during an eruption,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
which have the microbes that have never been

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
to the surface of the planet before.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
They eject it to the surface where it floats,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
and it is picked up

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
by an autonomous airplane,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
and it's brought back to the laboratory

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
within 24 hours of the eruption.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
This is doable. All the pieces are there.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
on 9/7.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
Some doctors in New York City removed

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
the gallbladder of a woman in France.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
and it would be on live TV,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
if we have interesting things to show.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
to the world, throughout the ocean.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
This -- I've shown you sea floor --

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
but so the goal here is real time interaction

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
with the oceans from anywhere on earth.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
It's going to be amazing.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
And as I go here,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260
and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
Many of you don't think of this yet,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
but the ocean will be in your pocket.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
It won't be long. It won't be long.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
So let me leave you then

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
with a few words

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.260
from another poet, if you'll forgive me.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
In 1943,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets."

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
He won the Nobel Prize for literature

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
in 1948.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
In "Little Gidding" he says --

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
speaking I think for the human race,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.260
but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia --

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260
"We shall not cease from exploration,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
and the end of all our exploring

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.260
will be to arrive where we started

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.260
and know the place for the first time,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.260
arrive through the unknown remembered gate

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
where the last of earth left to discover

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.260
is that which was the beginning.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
At the source of the longest river

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.260
the voice of a hidden waterfall

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.260
not known because not looked for,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.260
but heard, half heard

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.260
in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea."

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.260
Thank you.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:42.260
(Applause)
