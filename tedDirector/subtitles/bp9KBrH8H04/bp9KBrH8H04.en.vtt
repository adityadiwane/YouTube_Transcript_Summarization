00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
As a boy,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I loved cars.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
When I turned 18,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I lost my best friend to a car accident.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Like this.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to saving one million people

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
every year.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I saw the concept first

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
in the DARPA Grand Challenges

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
where the U.S. government issued a prize

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And even though a hundred teams were there,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
these cars went nowhere.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
We built the hardware and the software.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
We made it learn from us,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and we set it free in the desert.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And the unimaginable happened:

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
it became the first car

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
winning Stanford 2 million dollars.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Since, our work has focused

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
on building driving cars

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that can drive anywhere by themselves --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
any street in California.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
We've driven 140,000 miles.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Our cars have sensors

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
by which they magically can see

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
everything around them

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and make decisions

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
about every aspect of driving.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It's the perfect driving mechanism.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
We've driven in cities,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
like in San Francisco here.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
We've encountered joggers,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
busy highways, toll booths,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and this is without a person in the loop;

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
the car just drives itself.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
people didn't even notice.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Mountain roads,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
day and night,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and even crooked Lombard Street

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
in San Francisco.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
(Laughter)

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Sometimes our cars get so crazy,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
they even do little stunts.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
What?

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Second Man: It's driving itself.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
but I can do something for all the people who died.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Do you know that driving accidents

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
are the number one cause of death for young people?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And do you realize that almost all of those

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
are due to human error

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and not machine error,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and can therefore be prevented by machines?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Do you realize

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that we could change the capacity of highways

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
by a factor of two or three

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
if we didn't rely on human precision

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
on staying in the lane --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
improve body position

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and therefore drive a little bit closer together

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
on a little bit narrower lanes,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Do you realize that you, TED users,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
spend an average

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
of 52 minutes per day

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
in traffic,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
wasting your time

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
on your daily commute?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
You could regain this time.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
This is four billion hours

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
wasted in this country alone.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and I'm really looking forward to a time

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
when generations after us look back at us

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Thank you.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
(Applause)
