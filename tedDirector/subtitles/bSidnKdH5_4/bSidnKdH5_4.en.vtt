00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
OK. We've heard a lot of people

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
speak at this conference

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
about the power of the human mind.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And what I'd like to do today

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
is give you a vivid example

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
of how that power can be unleashed

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
when someone is in a survival situation,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
how the will to survive can bring that out in people.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
So I'll take you through that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and we'll see what it's like

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
when someone really

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
summons the will to survive.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
OK, this is Mount Everest.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
It's 29,035 feet high.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
making tectonic plate measurements;

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
twice, I went with NASA

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
doing remote sensing devices.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
It was on my fourth trip to Everest

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And the Sherpas told us then

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
that was a very bad omen,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and we should have listened to them.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Everest is an extreme environment.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Near the summit, temperatures

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
can be 40 degrees below zero.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It's actually a wind-chill factor

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
which is lower than a summer day on Mars.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
I remember one time being up near the summit,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I reached into my down jacket

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
for a drink from my water bottle,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
inside my down jacket,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
That gives you an idea of just how severe

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
things are near the summit.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
OK, this is the route up Everest.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
what's called the Western Cwm.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And then Camp Four is the highest camp;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
This is a view of base camp.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
before you have to unload.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And this is what they unloaded for me:

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I had four yak loads of medical supplies,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
which are dumped in a tent,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and here I am trying to arrange things.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
This was our expedition.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
It was a National Geographic expedition,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
but it was organized by The Explorers Club.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
There were three other expeditions on the mountain,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
an American team, a New Zealand team

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and an IMAX team.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And, after actually two months of preparation,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
we built our camps all the way up the mountain.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
This is a view looking up the icefall,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
the first 2,000 feet of the climb

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
up from base camp.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And here's a picture in the icefall;

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and it actually changes every day.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
you can't even see over the top.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
This is near the top of the icefall.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
This is me crossing a crevasse.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
That's another crevasse.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and one of my climbing friends says that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the reason we actually climb at night

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
is because if we ever saw the bottom

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
of what we're climbing over,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
we would never do it.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Okay. This is Camp One.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
It's the first flat spot you can reach

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
after you get up to the top of the icefall.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And from there we climb up to Camp Two,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
which is sort of the foreground.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that mountain toward Camp Three.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
They're on fixed ropes here.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
A fall here, if you weren't roped in,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
would be 5,000 feet down.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
This is a view taken from camp three.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
so you put the camp halfway through.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
There's no ice over it.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And that's because Everest is so high,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
it's in the jet stream,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and winds are constantly scouring the face,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
so no snow gets to accumulate.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
is actually snow being blown off the summit.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
moving in, up through the clouds.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And this is at Camp Four.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and you either have to go up or go down,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
make that decision very quickly.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
This is a picture of Rob Hall.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
This is a radio he used later to call his wife

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that I'll tell you about.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
This is not good weather to climb in,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
on what's called the Triangular Face.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
It's the first part of climb.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So that's what happened.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
The summit would be in the foreground.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
From here, it's about 1,500 feet

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
But what happened that year was

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
You can see here some ferocious winds

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
blowing snow way high off the summit.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
This is a picture of me in that area

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
taken a year before,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
with a rebreather.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
I have an oxygen hose connected here.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
little titanium tanks, very lightweight --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and we're not carrying much else.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
This is on the way toward the summit,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
on that 1,500-foot bridge.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
All the climbers here are climbing unroped,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and the reason is because

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
the drop off is so sheer on either side

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
that if you were roped to somebody,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So each person climbs individually.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And it's not a straight path at all,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
it's very difficult climbing,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and there's always the risk

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
of falling on either side.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
8,000 feet into Nepal;

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
if you fall to your right,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
because you'll live longer.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Laughter)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
along that summit ridge that you see up there,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and I was down here in Camp Three.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
My expedition was down in Camp Three,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
while these guys were up there in the storm.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
fully dressed, fully equipped,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
laid out on the tent floor

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And the climbers up on the ridge

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and completely exposed to the elements.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
We were in radio contact with some of them.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
This is a view taken along the summit ridge.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Rob Hall, we heard by radio,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
was up here, at this point in the storm

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
with Doug Hansen.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And we heard that Rob was OK,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
but Doug was too weak to come down.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
We also got some bad news in the storm

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that Beck Weathers, another climber,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
had collapsed in the snow and was dead.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
There were still 18 other climbers

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.260
that we weren't aware of their condition.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.260
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
We were just hunkered down

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
in our tents at Camp Three.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
decided to go up to try to rescue who they could

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
even though there was a ferocious storm going.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
who was a superb climber

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
stuck, sort of, with a weak climber

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
up near the summit.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
I expected them to say to Rob,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
"Hold on. We're coming."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
But in fact, what they said was,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
"Leave Doug and come down yourself.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
There's no chance of saving him,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and just try to save yourself at this point."

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And Rob got that message,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but his answer was,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
"We're both listening."

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
under their own power.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
So the climbers were coming down along this route.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And they all came by me

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
which is really not much, because Camp Three

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
is a little notch cut in the ice

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
in the middle of a 45-degree angle.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
You can barely stand outside the tent.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
The only supplies I had at that altitude

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
were two plastic bags

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
with preloaded syringes

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
of painkiller and steroids.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So, as the climbers came by me,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
to continue on further down.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I would give an injection of steroids

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
to try to give them some period

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
of lucidity and coordination

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
where they could then work their way further down the mountain.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
I even gave the injections right through their clothes.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
It was just too hard to maneuver

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
any other way up there.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
While I was taking care of them,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
we got more news about Rob Hall.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
He called in to say that he was alone now.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
he was just beyond rescue

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and he knew it.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
At that point, he asked

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
to be paged into his wife.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
He was carrying a radio.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
His wife was home in New Zealand,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
seven months pregnant with their first child,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and Rob and his wife

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
had their last conversation.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
They picked the name for their baby.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Rob then signed off,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and that was the last we ever heard of him.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
at 24,000 feet,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
which was an impossibility.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
So what we did was, we got the victims

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
This was my medical kit.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
This is what I carried up the mountain.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
I had more supplies lower down,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And this was scene at the lower camp.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
The survivors came in one by one.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Some of them were hypothermic,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
some of them were frostbitten, some were both.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
put oxygen on them and try to revive them,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
when the tent is freezing.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
This is some severe frostbite on the feet,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
severe frostbite on the nose.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
This climber was snow blind.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
As I was taking care of these climbers,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.260
we got a startling experience.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
who we had already been told was dead,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
stumbled into the tent,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
I expected him to be incoherent,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And then he said,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
"Do you accept my health insurance?"

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
(Laughter)

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
He really said that.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
(Laughter)

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
You can see his hand is completely white;

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
his face, his nose, is burned.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
it turns black, and then it falls off.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
It's the last stage, just like a scar.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So, as I was taking care of Beck,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
he related what had been going on up there.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
He said he had gotten lost in the storm,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
collapsed in the snow,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and just laid there, unable to move.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Some climbers had come by and looked at him,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and he heard them say, "He's dead."

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
but he was completely unable to move.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
He was in some sort of catatonic state

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
where he could be aware of his surroundings,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So the climbers passed him by,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and Beck lay there for a day, a night

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and another day,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
in the snow.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And then he said to himself,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
"I don't want to die.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
I have a family to come back to."

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And the thoughts of his family,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
his kids and his wife,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
generated enough energy,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
enough motivation in him,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
so that he actually got up.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
After laying in the snow that long a time,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.260
he got up and found his way back to the camp.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And Beck told me that story very quietly,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
but I was absolutely stunned by it.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
that long a time

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and then getting up.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
He apparently reversed

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
an irreversible hypothermia.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And I can only try to speculate

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
on how he did it.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So, what if we had Beck

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
hooked up to a SPECT scan,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
something that could actually measure brain function?

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain:

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
the frontal lobe, where you focus

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
your attention and concentration;

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
you have the temporal lobe,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
where you form images and keep memories;

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and the posterior part of your brain,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and the brain stem,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
where you have your basic maintenance functions,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
like heartbeat and respiration.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
So let's take a cut through the brain here,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and imagine that Beck

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
was hooked up to a SPECT scan.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
This measures dynamic blood flow

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
and therefore energy flow within the brain.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
So you have the prefrontal cortex here,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
lighting up in red.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
You have the middle area,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
where the temporal lobe might be, in here,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
This is a roughly normal scan,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
showing equal distribution of energy.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
the frontal lobes are lighting up.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
This might be what Beck would be experiencing

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
when he realizes he's in danger.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
He's focusing all his attention

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
on getting himself out of trouble.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
These parts of the brain are quieting down.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and he's working pretty hard.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
OK, but he's losing ground here.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
He's running out of energy.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
and, you see, there's no more red here;

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
his brain is quieting down.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
there's very little red anywhere.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Beck is powering down.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
He's dying.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
You go on to the next scan,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
but, in Beck's case,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
you can see that the middle part of his brain

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
is beginning to light up again.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
He's beginning to think about his family.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
He's beginning to have images

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
that are motivating him to get up.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
He's developing energy in this area

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
through thought.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
And this is how he's going to turn thought

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
back into action.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
It's an area in which

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
a lot of neuroscientists believe

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
the seat of will exists.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
And, you can see, there's an energy flow

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
going from the mid portion of his brain,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
where he's got images of his family,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
into this area, which is powering his will.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
to the point where it's actually

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
going to be a motivating factor.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
He's going to develop enough energy in that area --

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
after a day, a night and a day --

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
to actually motivate himself to get up.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And you can see here,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
So this energy has been transmitted

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
up toward the front of his brain,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
and it's getting quieter down here,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
but he's using this energy

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
to think about what he has to do to get himself going.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
And then, that energy is sort of spreading

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
throughout his thought areas.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
and he's going to be pacing himself.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
during this survival epic.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
compared to what he had done for himself.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
luckily, we were able to get a helicopter

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
in to rescue these guys.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
and the other survivors, one by one,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
before we even got back to base camp.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
This is a scene at base camp,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
at one of the camps

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
where some of the climbers were lost.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
And we had a memorial service there

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
a few days later.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
They believe juniper smoke is holy.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.260
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260
and spoke of the climbers who were lost

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
up near the summit,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.260
turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.260
There were five climbers lost here.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.260
This was Scott Fischer,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
Rob Hall,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.260
Andy Harris,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.260
Doug Hansen

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.260
and Yasuko Namba.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
And one more climber

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.260
should have died that day, but didn't,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
and that's Beck Weathers.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.260
He was able to survive

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.260
because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.260
he was able to use all the power of his mind

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
to save himself.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.260
These are Tibetan prayer flags.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
These Sherpas believe that

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.260
if you write prayers on these flags,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.260
the message will be carried up to the gods,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.260
and that year, Beck's message was answered.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
Thank you.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.260
(Applause)
