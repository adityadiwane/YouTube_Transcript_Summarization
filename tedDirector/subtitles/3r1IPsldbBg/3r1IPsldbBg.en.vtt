00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:15.117
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that

00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:17.197
companies, the really cool companies,

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:18.709
the innovative ones, the creative,

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:20.511
new economy-type companies --

00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.885
Apple, Google, Facebook --

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.573
are coming out of one particular country,

00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:28.304
the United States of America?

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:30.262
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.740
That's Europe." But, yeah.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.424
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.392
Now what I do is I'm an economist,

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:38.880
and I actually study the relationship

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.925
between innovation and economic growth

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:43.824
at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,

00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:45.939
and I work with policymakers worldwide,

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.410
especially in the European Commission,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.721
but recently also in interesting places like China,

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.596
and I can tell you that that question

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:55.196
is on the tip of all of their tongues:

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:57.415
Where are the European Googles?

00:00:57.415 --> 00:01:01.160
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.168
which they understand is different

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:06.049
from this old economy growth model?

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.728
And what is interesting is that often,

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:10.307
even if we're in the 21st century,

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:12.690
we kind of come down in the end to these ideas

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.663
of market versus state.

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:16.715
It's talked about in these modern ways,

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:20.478
but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:24.264
the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,

00:01:24.264 --> 00:01:27.536
the private initiative, whether this be about

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:29.750
a dynamic venture capital sector

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.096
that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:33.769
to these innovative companies,

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:35.894
the gazelles as we often call them,

00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:37.889
which traditional banks are scared of,

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.921
or different types of really successful

00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:42.927
commercialization policies which actually allow these companies

00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:45.182
to bring these great inventions, their products,

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:47.205
to the market and actually get over this

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:49.456
really scary Death Valley period

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:52.022
in which many companies instead fail.

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.798
But what really interests me, especially nowadays

00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:57.759
and because of what's happening politically around the world,

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.012
is the language that's used, the narrative,

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:04.171
the discourse, the images, the actual words.

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.476
So we often are presented

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:09.449
with the kind of words like that the private sector

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.719
is also much more innovative because it's able to

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.319
think out of the box.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.572
They are more dynamic.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.326
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:21.464
to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,

00:02:21.464 --> 00:02:23.556
where he said to be innovative,

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:26.326
you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:27.861
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.012
and foolish and colorful guys, right?

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:31.965
And in places like Europe,

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:33.550
it might be more equitable,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.112
we might even be a bit better dressed

00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:37.378
and eat better than the U.S.,

00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:41.410
but the problem is this damn public sector.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.403
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed

00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:48.168
these things like dynamic venture capital

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.902
and commercialization to actually be able to really

00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:52.606
be as fruitful as it could.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.558
And even really respectable newspapers,

00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:56.645
some that I'm actually subscribed to,

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:58.598
the words they use are, you know,

00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:01.701
the state as this Leviathan. Right?

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:03.834
This monster with big tentacles.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.738
They're very explicit in these editorials.

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:08.267
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:10.193
to fix these little market failures

00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:11.952
when you have public goods

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:14.784
or different types of negative externalities like pollution,

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:17.839
but you know what, what is the next big revolution

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.257
going to be after the Internet?

00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:21.191
We all hope it might be something green,

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.400
or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say --

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.266
this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.921
they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?

00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:33.409
Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.432
Even fund the basic research, because this is

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:38.101
popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good

00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.259
which private companies don't want to invest in,

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.820
do that, but you know what?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.600
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.897
Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.

00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:49.524
They're often called garage tinkerers,

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:51.554
because some of them actually did some things in garages,

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.129
even though that's partly a myth.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.423
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:57.607
only 10 minutes,

00:03:57.607 --> 00:04:00.597
is to really think again this juxtaposition,

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:03.456
because it actually has massive, massive implications

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:04.950
beyond innovation policy,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.710
which just happens to be the area

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.590
that I often talk with with policymakers.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.308
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:16.508
that we have on where, when and why

00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:19.581
we should actually be cutting back on public spending

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:21.626
and different types of public services which,

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:23.383
of course, as we know, are increasingly being

00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:25.445
outsourced because of this juxtaposition.

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:28.908
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools

00:04:28.908 --> 00:04:32.770
is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.521
by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.

00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:37.504
So these kind of words are constantly,

00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:39.368
these juxtapositions come up everywhere,

00:04:39.368 --> 00:04:42.216
not just with innovation policy.

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.887
And so to think again,

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:46.293
there's no reason that you should believe me,

00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:47.755
so just think of some of the smartest

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.026
revolutionary things that you have in your pockets

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:52.968
and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:55.614
Ask who actually funded the really cool,

00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:57.746
revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box

00:04:57.746 --> 00:04:59.533
things in the iPhone.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.276
What actually makes your phone

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:03.195
a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.286
So the Internet, which you can surf the web

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:06.994
anywhere you are in the world;

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:09.578
GPS, where you can actually know where you are

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:10.911
anywhere in the world;

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:13.044
the touchscreen display, which makes it also

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.509
a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.226
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:23.627
and they're all government-funded.

00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:26.216
And the point is that the Internet

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:28.460
was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.355
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.

00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:35.113
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.

00:05:35.113 --> 00:05:37.052
The touchscreen display was funded

00:05:37.052 --> 00:05:41.847
by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF

00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:46.302
to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:48.520
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.855
the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:53.107
but what's really interesting is that this is actually true

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:56.115
in sector after sector and department after department.

00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.253
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:00.182
very interested in because I've actually had the fortune

00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:02.896
to study it in quite some depth,

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:05.073
is wonderful to be asking this question

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.820
about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.836
because each and every medicine can actually be

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:13.807
divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.580
So the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.855
are the revolutionary new drugs,

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:21.756
whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.747
Viagra, different color, different dosage --

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:26.040
are the less revolutionary ones.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.897
And it turns out that a full 75 percent

00:06:28.897 --> 00:06:31.674
of the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:36.785
are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.468
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:41.519
They do. They spend on the marketing part.

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.667
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.214
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:48.115
which is quite problematic.

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:50.332
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently

00:06:50.332 --> 00:06:52.923
have spent more money in buying back their shares

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:54.959
to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D,

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.287
but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day

00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:00.551
I'd be fascinated to tell you about.

00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:02.554
Now, what's interesting in all of this

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:04.788
is the state, in all these examples,

00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:08.902
was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.

00:07:08.902 --> 00:07:11.631
It was actually shaping and creating markets.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.907
It was funding not only the basic research,

00:07:13.907 --> 00:07:16.266
which again is a typical public good,

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:17.858
but even the applied research.

00:07:17.858 --> 00:07:21.534
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.

00:07:21.534 --> 00:07:24.633
So these SBIR and SDTR programs,

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:28.664
which give small companies early-stage finance

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:30.879
have not only been extremely important

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.976
compared to private venture capital,

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:35.993
but also have become increasingly important.

00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:38.869
Why? Because, as many of us know,

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:40.736
V.C. is actually quite short-term.

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.525
They want their returns in three to five years.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.054
Innovation takes a much longer time than that,

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:46.881
15 to 20 years.

00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.268
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.595
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:53.320
Of course, it's not just the state.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.550
The private sector does a lot.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.749
But the narrative that we've always been told

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:59.632
is the state is important for the basics,

00:07:59.632 --> 00:08:01.912
but not really providing that sort of high-risk,

00:08:01.912 --> 00:08:04.212
revolutionary thinking out of the box.

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:06.544
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:09.449
to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:11.740
the strategic vision, for these investments,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.328
it was actually coming within the state.

00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:15.697
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating

00:08:15.697 --> 00:08:18.795
to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,

00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:20.766
came from within government.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.113
And so there's huge implications of this.

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:25.218
First of all, of course I'm not someone,

00:08:25.218 --> 00:08:27.220
this old-fashioned person, market versus state.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.745
What we all know in dynamic capitalism

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:32.804
is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.543
But the point is, by constantly depicting

00:08:35.543 --> 00:08:37.668
the state part as necessary

00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:40.549
but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.598
and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,

00:08:43.598 --> 00:08:46.350
I think we've actually really stunted the possibility

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.922
to build these public-private partnerships

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:49.468
in a really dynamic way.

00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:52.662
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,

00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:54.890
the public part -- well, they're both P's --

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.250
with public-private partnerships

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.305
is in terms of de-risking.

00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.766
What the public sector did in all these examples

00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:02.853
I just gave you, and there's many more,

00:09:02.853 --> 00:09:06.317
which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:07.867
is doing much more than de-risking.

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.433
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:13.006
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:15.717
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience

00:09:15.717 --> 00:09:17.777
with local, regional, national governments,

00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:20.924
and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."

00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:24.368
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:26.182
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:28.348
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,

00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:30.675
boring, it's sometimes

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:32.887
that we actually create those organizations in that way.

00:09:32.887 --> 00:09:35.088
So what we have to actually do is build

00:09:35.088 --> 00:09:37.264
these entrepreneurial state organizations.

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:39.753
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,

00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:41.338
actually thought really hard about this,

00:09:41.338 --> 00:09:44.031
how to welcome failure, because you will fail.

00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:45.956
You will fail when you innovative.

00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:49.828
One out of 10 experiments has any success.

00:09:49.828 --> 00:09:51.566
And the V.C. guys know this,

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.438
and they're able to actually fund the other losses

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:55.292
from that one success.

00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:56.785
And this brings me, actually, probably,

00:09:56.785 --> 00:09:59.380
to the biggest implication,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.047
and this has huge implications beyond innovation.

00:10:02.047 --> 00:10:05.707
If the state is more than just a market fixer,

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:07.519
if it actually is a market shaper,

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.487
and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:12.481
what happened to the reward?

00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:14.855
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,

00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:18.261
the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,

00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:19.881
and so some people are foolish enough

00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:22.343
or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,

00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:24.825
to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:27.345
which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,

00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:28.924
that whole risk-reward thing.

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:30.897
Well, where's the reward for the state

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:33.353
of having taken on these massive risks

00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:35.812
and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?

00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:37.764
The Internet was crazy.

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:40.916
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.

00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:43.526
You had to be completely nuts to do it,

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:45.307
and luckily, they were.

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.808
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards

00:10:47.808 --> 00:10:51.956
unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.

00:10:51.956 --> 00:10:54.557
And the problem is that economists often think,

00:10:54.557 --> 00:10:57.043
well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.

00:10:57.043 --> 00:10:58.592
You know, the companies will pay tax,

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.882
the jobs they create will create growth

00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:04.033
so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:07.257
will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.

00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:09.247
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.

00:11:09.247 --> 00:11:12.766
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:15.733
Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:17.940
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.029
I mean, one can take a position on that.

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:21.693
But also these companies

00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:24.765
that have actually had this massive benefit from the state --

00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:26.626
Apple's a great example.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:28.675
They even got the first -- well, not the first,

00:11:28.675 --> 00:11:33.243
but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,

00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:35.912
through this SBIC program,

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:37.960
which predated the SBIR program,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.278
as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.

00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:43.768
And yet we know they legally,

00:11:43.768 --> 00:11:47.450
as many other companies, pay very little tax back.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.437
So what we really need to actually rethink

00:11:50.437 --> 00:11:54.696
is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:57.383
that's much more direct than tax. Why not?

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.953
It could happen perhaps through equity.

00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:01.760
This, by the way, in the countries

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.064
that are actually thinking about this strategically,

00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:06.195
countries like Finland in Scandinavia,

00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:08.230
but also in China and Brazil,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.560
they're retaining equity in these investments.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.386
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:17.046
it's a public funding agency in Finland,

00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:19.872
which then funded the next round of Nokias.

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.881
The Brazilian Development Bank,

00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:24.676
which is providing huge amounts of funds today

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:26.473
to clean technology, they just announced

00:12:26.473 --> 00:12:30.722
a $56 billion program for the future on this,

00:12:30.722 --> 00:12:34.261
is retaining equity in these investments.

00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:35.773
So to put it provocatively,

00:12:35.773 --> 00:12:38.712
had the U.S. government thought about this,

00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:40.556
and maybe just brought back

00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:42.981
just something called an innovation fund,

00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:46.113
you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent

00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:47.996
of the profits from what the Internet produced

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:49.654
had come back to that innovation fund,

00:12:49.654 --> 00:12:51.278
there would be so much more money

00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:53.506
to spend today on green technology.

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.000
Instead, many of the state budgets

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.598
which in theory are trying to do that

00:12:57.598 --> 00:12:59.434
are being constrained.

00:12:59.434 --> 00:13:01.244
But perhaps even more important,

00:13:01.244 --> 00:13:03.111
we heard before about the one percent,

00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:04.686
the 99 percent.

00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:08.431
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,

00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:11.464
as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,

00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:13.285
because that's what we're talking about, right?

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:15.219
Who are the different players in creating value

00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:17.514
in the economy, and is the state's role,

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:21.243
has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:23.598
If we can actually have a broader theory

00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:25.651
of value creation and allow us to actually admit

00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:28.702
what the state has been doing and reap something back,

00:13:28.702 --> 00:13:31.521
it might just be that in the next round,

00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:34.087
and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution

00:13:34.087 --> 00:13:35.728
will in fact be green,

00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:37.451
that that period of growth

00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:40.141
will not only be smart, innovation-led,

00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:43.327
not only green, but also more inclusive,

00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:46.581
so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley

00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:49.321
can actually also benefit from that growth,

00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:50.920
because they have not.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.173
Thank you.

00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:57.420
(Applause)
