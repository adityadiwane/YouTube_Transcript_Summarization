00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
When most people think about the beginnings

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
and the virus that causes it, HIV.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
from chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
This photo was taken before the Great Depression

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
in Brazzaville, Congo.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
At this time, there were thousands of individuals,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
we think, that were infected with HIV.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.330
If this virus was in thousands

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
of individuals at this point,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
why was it the case that it took us until 1984

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
to be able to discover this virus?

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
OK now, more importantly,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
had we seen this disease, had we understood

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
In fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
viruses come from animals.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
from animals into human populations.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
that are going to be very very difficult to address --

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
as we've seen in the case of HIV.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
So during the last 15 years,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here --

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
what I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
by my mentor Don Burke.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
This is the idea that we can study the sort of

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
pinging of these viruses into human populations,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
the movement of these agents over into humans;

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
and by capturing this moment,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
some pictures now from the field.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
This is a picture of a central African hunter.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
It's actually a fairly common picture.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
One of the things I want you to note from it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
This was absolutely key for us. This is a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
very intimate form of connection.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
So if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And so we've been studying people like this individual.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
We collect blood from them, other specimens.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
early on, as they're moving over into human populations.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
And the basic objective of this work is not to just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
go out once and look at these individuals,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
but to establish thousands of individuals

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
in these populations that we would monitor

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
continuously on a regular basis.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
We would actually enlist them --

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
When they sample from animals,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
they collect the blood on the filter paper

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals --

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
the ones that are actually being hunted.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
two hunters stalk their prey.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Their names are Patrice and Patee.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
They're searching for bush meat;

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
forest animals they can kill to feed their families.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
in the forest around their homes.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.330
to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
rodents -- anything they can, really.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
The animals are simply gone.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
We stop for a drink of water.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330
Then there is a rustle in the brush.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
A group of hunters approach,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
their packs loaded with wild game.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
There's at least three viruses

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
that you know about, which are in this particular monkey.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Nathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
that are present in these animals.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
These individuals are at specific risk,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.330
and possibly infection with novel viruses.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Narrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
NW: So this is from this animal right here,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
at a minimum, been through our basic health education

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
about the risks associated with these activities,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
which presumably, from our perspective,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
gives them the ability to decrease their own risk,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
and then obviously the risk to their families,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
the village, the country, and the world.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
I'm going to be talking about this.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
When your children and grandchildren

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
sort of pose questions to you about this period of time,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
one of the things they're gonna ask you,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
some of the most valuable and endangered species

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
on our planet, to go extinct because we

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
weren't able to address some of the issues

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
of poverty in these parts of the world.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
They're also going to ask you the question

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
into the human population,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
why did we let these behaviors continue?

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Why did we not find some other solution to this?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
They're going to say, in regions of profound

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
instability throughout the world,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
and you don't have sustainable resources like this,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.330
this is going to lead to food insecurity.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
But they're also going to ask you probably a different question.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder --

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
this is the individual that hunted the monkey

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
from the last picture that I showed you.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
OK, take a look at his shirt.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
You know, take a look at his face.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
Bush meat is one of the central crises,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
which is occurring in our population right now,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
in humanity, on this planet.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.330
OK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
There's no easy solutions,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
at our own peril.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
So, in 1998, along with my mentors

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
we went to actually start this work

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
in Central Africa, to work with hunters

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
in this part of the world.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
and I was really tasked with setting this up.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
So I said to myself, "OK, great --

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
different locations. It's going to be wonderful."

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
I figured, no problem.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
(Laughter)

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
Needless to say, I was drastically wrong.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
This is challenging work to do.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
Fortunately, I had and continue to have

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
and that's the only way that this work can really occur.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
We have a whole range of challenges about this work.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
One of them is just obtaining trust

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
from individuals that we work with in the field.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.330
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
Paul worked for years

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
on the Cameroonian national radio and television,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
be a great communicator.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
When we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
is that no one had television,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
so they wouldn't recognize his face.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
But -- when he began to speak

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
they would actually recognize his voice from the radio.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
And this was somebody who had incredible

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
potential to spread aspects of our message,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
or health prevention.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
one of these very rural sites,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
with specimens from 200 individuals

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
I like to show this shot -- this is

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
Ubald Tamoufe, who's the lead

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
investigator in our Cameroon site.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
because of course you can't see his face.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
But the reason I like to show the shot

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.330
(Laughter)

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
Which -- which he did, which he did.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Just a few quick before and after shots.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
This was our laboratory before.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
This is what it looks like now.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
Early on, in order to ship our specimens,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.330
I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
(Laughter)

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
No comment.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
So what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
this work, we actually surprised ourselves.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
We made a number of discoveries.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
And what we've found is that if you look in the right place,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
you can actually monitor the flow

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
of these viruses into human populations.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
including new viruses in the same group

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
human population -- it's something we should be aware of.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
It's something we should be following. It's not something

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
that we should be surprised by.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Needless to say in the past

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
these viruses entering into these rural communities

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
might very well have gone extinct.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.330
And critically, what happens in central Africa

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
doesn't stay in Central Africa.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
So, once we discovered that it was really possible

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
that we could actually do this monitoring,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
we decided to move this from research, to

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.330
really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
Through generous support and partnership

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
and begin work in four different sites

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
in Africa and Asia.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
have different sorts of contact.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
It's also working in live animal markets --

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
SARS emerged in Asia.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
Our objective right now, in addition to

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
deploying to these sites and getting everything moving,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
is to identify new partners

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
because we feel like this effort needs to be extended

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.330
to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots --

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
so that we can catch these things, ideally,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
before they make it to blood banks,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
sexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
There was a time not very long ago

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
when the discovery of unknown organisms

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
was something that held incredible awe for us.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
and thought about ourselves.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Many people, I think, on our planet right now

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
despair, and they think

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
If an intelligent extra-terrestrial

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
27 out of 30 of these volumes

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
would be devoted to bacteria and virus,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
with just a few of the volumes left

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
for plants, fungus and animals,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
humans being a footnote;

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
This is honestly the most exciting period

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
The dominant things that exist here

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
we know almost nothing about.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
And yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and understand them.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Thank you very much.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.330
(Applause)
