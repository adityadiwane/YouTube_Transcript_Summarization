00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:15.069
Thirteen years ago,

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:21.450
we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.069
After some success,

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.123
we've hit a big hurdle.

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:29.644
The aftermath of the financial crisis

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:32.369
has begun to hit aid payments,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.133
which have fallen for two consecutive years.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.112
My question is whether the lessons learned

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:45.032
from saving the financial system

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:48.514
can be used to help us overcome that hurdle

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.719
and help millions.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.629
Can we simply print money for aid?

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.136
"Surely not."

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:02.145
It's a common reaction.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.167
(Laughter)

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.677
It's a quick talk.

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:10.454
Others channel John McEnroe.

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:12.426
"You cannot be serious!"

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:17.357
Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,

00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:21.357
thanks to these two children,

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.037
who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:27.529
of my talk.

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:30.495
On the left, we have Pia.

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.085
She lives in England.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.229
She has two loving parents,

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.129
one of whom is standing right here.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.521
Dorothy, on the right,

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:45.420
lives in rural Kenya.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.059
She's one of 13,000 orphans

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:49.564
and vulnerable children

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:54.912
who are assisted by a charity that I support.

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:57.692
I do that because I believe

00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:00.013
that Dorothy, like Pia,

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.351
deserves the best life chances

00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:05.915
that we can afford to give her.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.954
You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.564
The U.N. agrees too.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.616
Their overriding aim

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:15.692
for international aid

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:21.830
is to strive for a life of dignity for all.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:26.354
But -- and here's that hurdle --

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:30.904
can we afford our aid aspirations?

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:34.197
History suggests not.

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:39.519
In 1970, governments set themselves a target

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.014
to increase overseas aid payments

00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:44.283
to 0.7 percent

00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:45.922
of their national income.

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:50.199
As you can see, a big gap opens up

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.793
between actual aid and that target.

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:59.056
But then come the Millennium Development Goals,

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.465
eight ambitious targets

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:05.373
to be met by 2015.

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:08.368
If I tell you that just one of those targets

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:12.551
is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.369
you get a sense of the ambition.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.974
There's also been some success.

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:20.283
The number of people living

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:26.259
on less than $1.25 a day has halved.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.986
But a lot remains to be done in two years.

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:33.677
One in eight remain hungry.

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:36.288
In the context of this auditorium,

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:40.736
the front two rows aren't going to get any food.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.894
We can't settle for that,

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:47.398
which is why the concern about the eighth goal,

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.218
which relates to funding,

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:52.132
which I said at the beginning is falling,

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:56.592
is so troubling.

00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.646
So what can be done?

00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:01.638
Well, I work in financial markets,

00:04:01.638 --> 00:04:04.089
not development.

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.126
I study the behavior of investors,

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:12.712
how they react to policy and the economy.

00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:17.345
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.866
But it took an innocent question

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.501
from my then-four-year-old daughter

00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:26.560
to make me appreciate that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.755
Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:34.171
and we passed a man collecting for charity.

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:35.722
I didn't have any change to give him,

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:38.223
and she was disappointed.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:42.001
Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.743
and starts scribbling.

00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:47.767
After a little while, I ask her what she's doing,

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:50.303
and she shows me a drawing

00:04:50.303 --> 00:04:52.515
of a Â£5 note

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:54.558
to give to the man outside.

00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:55.811
It's so sweet,

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.911
and more generous than Dad would have been.

00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:00.837
But of course I explained to her,

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:03.340
"You can't do that; it's not allowed."

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.034
To which I get the classic four-year-old response:

00:05:08.034 --> 00:05:10.582
"Why not?"

00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:12.996
Now I'm excited, because I actually think

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:14.837
I can answer this time.

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:17.752
So I launch into an explanation of how

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:21.067
an unlimited supply of money

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:24.246
chasing a limited number of goods

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:29.180
sends prices to the moon.

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:35.355
Something about that exchange stuck with me,

00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:37.458
not because of the look of relief

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.721
on Pia's face when I finally finished,

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.511
but because it related

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:49.412
to the sanctity of the money supply,

00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:53.714
a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned

00:05:53.714 --> 00:05:56.633
by the reaction of central banks

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:59.109
to the financial crisis.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.676
To reassure investors,

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:06.573
central banks began buying assets

00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:11.609
to try and encourage investors to do the same.

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:15.207
They funded these purchases

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:18.756
with money they created themselves.

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:22.042
The money wasn't actually physically printed.

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:25.656
It's still sort of locked away
in the banking system today.

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:30.857
But the amount created was unprecedented.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:34.362
Together, the central banks of the U.S.,

00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:36.232
U.K and Japan

00:06:36.232 --> 00:06:39.622
increased the stock of money in their economies

00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:43.650
by 3.7 trillion dollars.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.105
That's three times, in fact
that's more than three times,

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:51.917
the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:56.165
Three times!

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.075
Before the crisis,

00:06:58.075 --> 00:07:03.023
this would have been utterly unthinkable,

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:10.487
yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:12.514
The price of gold,

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:15.262
an asset thought to protect against inflation,

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:18.088
did jump,

00:07:18.088 --> 00:07:20.886
but investors bought other assets

00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:23.517
that offered little protection from inflation.

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:27.061
They bought fixed income securities, bonds.

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.828
They bought equities too.

00:07:29.828 --> 00:07:32.487
For all the scare stories,

00:07:32.487 --> 00:07:35.516
the actual actions of investors

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:42.041
spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:47.716
That confidence was based on two pillars.

00:07:47.716 --> 00:07:50.181
The first was that, after years

00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.437
of keeping inflation under control,

00:07:53.437 --> 00:07:56.244
central banks were trusted

00:07:56.244 --> 00:07:59.531
to take the money-printing away

00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:03.152
if inflation became a threat.

00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:09.381
Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.

00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:11.249
As you can see, in the United States,

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:13.290
inflation for most of this period

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.747
remained below average.

00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:20.019
It was the same elsewhere.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:23.436
So how does all this relate to aid?

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:27.311
Well, this is where Dorothy

00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:29.777
and the Mango Tree charity

00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:32.335
that supports her comes in.

00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:34.432
I was at one of their fundraising events

00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:35.652
earlier this year,

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:39.401
and I was inspired to give a one-off donation

00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:42.239
when I remembered that my firm

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.498
offers to match the charitable contributions

00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:48.241
its employees make.

00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:50.967
So think of this:

00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:53.254
Instead of just being able to help Dorothy

00:08:53.254 --> 00:08:55.960
and four of her classmates

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.240
to go through secondary school for a few years,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.544
I was able to double my contribution.

00:09:02.544 --> 00:09:04.957
Brilliant.

00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:10.920
So following that conversation with my daughter,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.557
and seeing the absence of inflation

00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:15.504
in the face of money-printing,

00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:18.591
and knowing that international aid payments

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.903
were falling at just the wrong time,

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:25.864
this made me wonder:

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:27.959
Could we match

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:34.009
but just on a much grander scale?

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:38.462
Let's call this scheme "Print Aid."

00:09:38.462 --> 00:09:41.120
And here's how it might work.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.277
Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,

00:09:46.277 --> 00:09:48.587
the central bank would be mandated

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:51.980
to match the government's overseas aid payments

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.447
up to a certain limit.

00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:56.520
Governments have been aiming to get aid

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.238
to 0.7 percent for years,

00:09:58.238 --> 00:10:01.123
so let's set the limit at half of that,

00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:05.232
0.35 percent of their income.

00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:07.304
So it would work like this: If in a given year

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:09.990
the government gave 0.2 percent of its income

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.122
to overseas aid,

00:10:11.122 --> 00:10:12.605
the central bank would simply top it up

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.781
with a further 0.2 percent.

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:19.382
So far so good.

00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:22.062
How risky is this?

00:10:22.062 --> 00:10:26.304
Well, this involves the creation of money

00:10:26.304 --> 00:10:29.112
to buy goods, not assets.

00:10:29.112 --> 00:10:32.665
It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:37.093
But there are two important mitigating factors here.

00:10:37.093 --> 00:10:40.636
The first is that by definition,

00:10:40.636 --> 00:10:45.786
this money printed would be spent overseas.

00:10:45.786 --> 00:10:49.327
So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation

00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:53.736
in the country doing the actual printing

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:58.670
unless it leads to a currency
depreciation of that country.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.963
That is unlikely for the second reason:

00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:04.844
the scale of the money that would be printed

00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:07.664
under this scheme.

00:11:07.664 --> 00:11:10.804
So let's think of an example

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:14.347
where Print Aid was in place

00:11:14.347 --> 00:11:18.689
in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.

00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:20.992
To match the aid payments made

00:11:20.992 --> 00:11:23.728
by those governments over the last four years,

00:11:23.728 --> 00:11:25.955
Print Aid would have generated

00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:30.290
200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.477
What would that look like

00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:36.079
in the context of the increase in the money stock

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.355
that had already happened in those countries

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.436
to save the financial system?

00:11:40.436 --> 00:11:43.593
Are you read for this?

00:11:43.593 --> 00:11:45.677
You might struggle to see that at the back,

00:11:45.677 --> 00:11:49.247
because the gap is quite small.

00:11:49.247 --> 00:11:51.695
So what we're saying here

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:55.163
is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble

00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.539
to save our financial systems,

00:11:57.539 --> 00:11:59.594
and you know what, it paid off.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.167
There was no inflation.

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:05.473
Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk

00:12:05.473 --> 00:12:10.125
to print an extra 200 billion for aid?

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:12.034
Would the risks really be that different?

00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:14.577
To me, it's not that clear.

00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:17.935
What is clear is the impact on aid.

00:12:17.935 --> 00:12:20.051
Even though this is the printing

00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:21.887
of just three central banks,

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:25.508
the global aid that's given

00:12:25.508 --> 00:12:30.429
over this period is up by almost 40 percent.

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:32.860
Aid as a proportion of national income

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.310
all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.297
Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.

00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:42.042
Governments are still incentivized to give.

00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:46.535
But you know what, that's the 
point of a matching scheme.

00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:50.350
So I think what we've learned

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.944
is that the risks from this money creation scheme

00:12:54.944 --> 00:12:57.725
are quite modest,

00:12:57.725 --> 00:13:00.525
but the benefits

00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:02.991
are potentially huge.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:06.294
Imagine what we could do
with 40 percent more funding.

00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:11.265
We might be able to feed the front row.

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:13.963
The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,

00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:15.687
apart from the fact that I've run out of time,

00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:20.404
is that the window of opportunity for this idea

00:13:20.404 --> 00:13:23.237
is a short one.

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:27.062
Today, money creation by central banks

00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:29.976
is an accepted policy tool.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.457
That may not always be the case.

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:36.820
Today there are universally agreed aims

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.711
for international aid.

00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:42.331
That may not always be the case.

00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:44.969
Today might be the only time

00:13:44.969 --> 00:13:47.852
that these two things coincide,

00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:51.827
such that we can afford the aid

00:13:51.827 --> 00:13:55.470
that we've always aspired to give.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:03.900
So, can we print money for international aid?

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.638
I seriously believe the question should be,

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.701
why not?

00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:12.514
Thank you very much.

00:14:12.514 --> 00:14:18.198
