00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I think the future of this planet depends on humans,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
not technology, and we already have the knowledge --

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.330
But we’re nowhere near the endgame

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
when it comes to our perception.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.330
We still have one foot in the dark ages.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And when you listen to some of the presentations here --

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
and then you contrast it with the fact

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
we still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary --

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
we have one foot in the dark ages.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It’s not flat, stupid, it’s round."

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite --

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know."

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.330
And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
This is an ocean planet.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
T.S. Eliot really said it for me --

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
and this should give you goose bumps:

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
"we shall not cease from exploration

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
and the end of our exploring shall be to return

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
where we started and know the place for the first time."

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
where the last of earth discovered

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
is that which is the beginning."

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
So I have one message.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.330
It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
For the rocketeers in the audience:

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.330
I admire the courage -- but your rockets

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.330
(Laughter)

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
And it’s all a question of perspective.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Let me try and tell you --

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
I don’t mean to insult you, but look,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
if I -- and I’m not doing this for real

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.330
because it would be an insult,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow --

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.330
and I held up another square that was the root two square --

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.330
so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans;

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Well, it’s the relative importance.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.330
water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.330
But it’s a question of perception,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and if that’s what you’re thinking,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
if that’s what you think I mean when I say,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
If you think that that’s the relative importance,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
but you sound like it when you say "Earth,"

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.330
because that demonstration, if I turned around this way --

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.330
that earth plane would be as thin as paper.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
The ocean representation would have a depth to it.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And if you hefted those two things

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.330
you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
It turns out that something more than

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.330
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
The problem we have in believing that

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
is -- you just have to give up this notion

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
that this Earth was created for us.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Because it’s a problem we have.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
If this is an ocean planet

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
and we only have a small minority of this planet,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
Okay. Let me criticize this thing.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
I’m not talking about James Cameron --

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
although I could, but I won’t.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
You really do have to go and see his latest film,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
"Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
It features two of these deep rovers,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
classic submersibles built.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.330
This is an acryclic sphere.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
It generates all of the buoyancy,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
all of the payload for the craft,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and the batteries are down here hanging underneath,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
exactly like a balloon.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.330
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And this one actually carries two great manipulators.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
It actually is a very good working sub --

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that’s what it was designed for.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
The problem with it is --

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
and the reason I will never build another one like it --

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.330
is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
we take all our terrestrial hang-ups,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
all our constraints -- importantly,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
these two-dimensional constraints that we have,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it --

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
and we take them underwater.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.330
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
A seat works in a two-dimensional world,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
And in a two-dimensional world,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.330
we do know about the third dimension

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
but we don’t use it because to go up

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.330
And then our mothers tell us,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.330
"Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water;

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres --

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
which is alien to us.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
Fish do not sit in seats.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.330
(Laughter)

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.330
They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
"Careful you don’t fall over."

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.330
They live in a three-dimensional world

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
where there is no difference in energy

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
between going this way, that way, that way or that way.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
It’s truly a three-dimensional space.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
I don’t know of any other submersible,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
or even remote, that just takes advantage

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
that this is a three-dimensional space.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
This is the way we should be going into the oceans.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
This is a three-dimensional machine.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
and move in this three-dimensional space.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.330
OK, this is good stuff.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.330
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
She has twice the wingspan that I do.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
There I’m coming; she sees me.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
And just notice how she rolls under and turns;

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
And the craft that I’m in --

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
this hasn’t been shown before.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.330
I wanted you to notice

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
that she actually turned to come back up.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
There I am; I see her coming back,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
coming up underneath me.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
I’m trying to do everything very gently.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
She gets about that close and then she pulls away.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.330
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.330
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.330
This was a fly by wire. It has wings.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks --

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
it’s permanently, positively buoyant.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.330
And then by moving through the water

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
it’s able to take that control.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
She just rolled right away from underneath.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:25.330
Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
It took 10 years to build.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:34.330
But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.330
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
I just had to go and build another machine.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
and coming up slowly without thinking about it,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
it’s a little bit of back pressure,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:55.330
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
I don’t really look that ugly,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Now, there she goes, right overhead.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.330
This is a wide-angle camera.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.330
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:14.330
"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.330
oh, I don’t know, just so close."

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.330
I come back up, not for air.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:26.330
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.330
(Applause)

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
Trying to fly and keep up with that animal --

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
It was the fact she was going so slow.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.330
I actually designed that to move faster through the water

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.330
because I thought that was the thing

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
that we needed to do: to move fast and get range.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
She wanted to dance.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
So the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.330
You see the larger wing area here.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.330
we wanted to try and bring other people

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
but we couldn't figure out how to do it.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
So we opened the world’s first flight school.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
The rational for the world’s first flight school

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say --

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
they used to leave us alone when we were diving

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
these goofy little spherical things,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.330
but when we started flying around

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous --

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.330
they would come up and say,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
"Do you have a license for that?"

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beard

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
that would all sprout out, and I would say,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
"I don’t need no stinking license."

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
(Laughter)

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
"I write these stinking license," which I do.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
So Bob Gelfond's around here --

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
They’re one of the first subsea aviators.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
So we’ve run two flight schools.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.330
Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.330
What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
But the patent for underwater flight --

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
Karen and I, we were looking at it,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
some business partners wanted us to patent it --

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.330
we weren’t sure about that.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
It just seems wrong to try and patent --

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.330
(Applause)

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
-- the freedom for underwater flight.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.330
So anybody who wants to copy us

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
and come and join us, go for it.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.330
The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.330
We developed some other technology

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
to make an announcement here this morning:

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
we’re going to be building a beautiful, little,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
small version of this -- unmanned, super deep --

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
(Applause)

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.330
Thank you.
