00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Compassion:

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what does it look like?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you come in you will see us: evening time,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
at the point when dinner is ready to be served.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Since mom had eight kids,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Before we could eat, she would ask,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
"Are all the children in?"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And if someone happened to be missing,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
then we could say grace, and we could eat.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Also, while we were at the table,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
there was a ritual in our family:

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
when something significant had happened for any one of us --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
For when one is honored, all are honored.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that is, extended members of the family,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
sick and elderly, shut in.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
who lived on East Street,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Why? Because they were old and infirm,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They are our family."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They would offer sweets or money.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you must always say, 'Nothing.'

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This was the nature of being at that table.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
from the members of the extended family,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
there is peace, and justice, and joy."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Of course, it was a minister's family,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so we had to add God into it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is always wondering: Are all the children in?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
except that daddy messed it up.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
on that particular Christmas to celebrate.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We thought he must be out of his mind.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is our time. This is intimate time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This is when we can just be who we are,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and now we have this stuffy brother

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And mom overheard us and said,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's what the celebration is all about.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, we sucked up.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
(Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it was a sensibility to how we are together.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We are sisters and brothers united together.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We're all strands in it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now that's compassion.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
reminding me of the Hebrew tradition

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that you may indeed harvest,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but you must always leave some on the edges,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
just in case there's someone who has not

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
had the share necessary for good nurture.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Talk about a picture of compassion.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I see -- always, it stirs my heart --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
walking across the bridge and going into Selma.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Just a photograph.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Arm in arm for struggle.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
robbing us of a sense of unity of being.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that day, everybody in my community was upset.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You heard about riots all across the land.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
This is the picture. They said,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
"It's going to be too volatile for you to go."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
He insisted, "I must go."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, sitting on a flatbed truck,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the elders of the community are there,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and Bobby stands up and says to the people,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"I have bad news for you.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I know that you are angry,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to enter now into activities of revenge. But,"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I know how you feel."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we can do that together."

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
He asked them to give a message,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and they each read in their own language a central affirmation,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and that was some version of the golden rule:

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
"As you would that others would do unto you,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
do also unto them."

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
affirming one message.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We are so connected that we must treat each other

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
a newspaperman and a television guy said,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
we carried it on our station in this city.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We were all suffering.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and you invited them.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
'Find out what it is in your tradition

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
when we have been despised and rejected.'

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And they all spoke out of their own traditions,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but I became a preacher.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but I got to do it too.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
"Some people preach the Gospel.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
How do you make it real?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and challenged me when I fell beneath it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
random acts of kindness.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
you will discover that a question has been raised

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that leads to this parable.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
"You must love yourself,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and your neighbor as yourself."

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and how religious authorities went the other way,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
but an unsuspecting, despised person came along,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
saw the man in need,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
provided oil and wine for his wounds,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
put him on his own transportation,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and took him to the inn

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
This always seemed to me to be a deepening

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
in an immediate act of care and charity,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that all God's children would have their needs cared for,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
are all the children in?" And we could say yes.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I recall that my work as a pastor

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
has always involved caring for their spiritual needs;

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
being concerned for housing, for healthcare,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
where they started off, where they are going.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and to be a good American -- for me,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
must be done around tables and rituals of faith

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
until we become that family, that family together

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
that understands the nature of our unity.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We are one people together.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
the day, or the year, of God's favor.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
This is a season of grace.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Unusual things are beginning to happen.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that the election of Obama was an unusual sign

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
of the fact that it is a year of favor.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
We need to bring health and food and education

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
remembering mama eternal.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Now, let me close my comments by telling you

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
that whenever I feel something very deeply,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
it usually takes the form of verse.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And so I want to close with a little song.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I close with this song -- it's a children's song --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
but to all who sign the charter for compassion.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And this is why we do it.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That's compassion. (Applause)
