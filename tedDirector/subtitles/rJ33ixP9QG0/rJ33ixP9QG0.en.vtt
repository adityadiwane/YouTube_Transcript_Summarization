00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:15.557
Throughout the history of computers

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:18.804
we've been striving
to shorten the gap between us

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:20.398
and digital information,

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.232
the gap between our physical world

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.030
and the world in the screen

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:26.872
where our imagination can go wild.

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:30.799
And this gap has become shorter,

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:33.564
shorter, and even shorter,

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.208
and now this gap is shortened down

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:36.518
to less than a millimeter,

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:38.396
the thickness of a touch-screen glass,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.846
and the power of computing

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.749
has become accessible to everyone.

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:49.788
But I wondered, what if there
could be no boundary at all?

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:53.532
I started to imagine
what this would look like.

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:55.983
First, I created this tool

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.492
which penetrates into the digital space,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.583
so when you press it hard on the screen,

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:03.916
it transfers its physical
body into pixels.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.028
Designers can materialize their ideas

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:07.724
directly in 3D,

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:10.276
and surgeons can practice
on virtual organs

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
underneath the screen.

00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:17.397
So with this tool, this
boundary has been broken.

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.364
But our two hands still
remain outside the screen.

00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:22.848
How can you reach inside and interact

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:24.275
with the digital information

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.279
using the full dexterity of our hands?

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:29.581
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:31.497
along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.768
I redesigned the computer

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.649
and turned a little space
above the keyboard

00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:38.014
into a digital workspace.

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:40.515
By combining a transparent
display and depth cameras

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.165
for sensing your fingers and face,

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.475
now you can lift up your hands
from the keyboard

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.313
and reach inside this 3D space

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:49.813
and grab pixels with your bare hands.

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:52.784
(Applause)

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:56.990
Because windows and files have
a position in the real space,

00:01:57.014 --> 00:02:00.349
selecting them is as easy
as grabbing a book off your shelf.

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:02.502
Then you can flip through this book

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:04.219
while highlighting the lines, words

00:02:04.243 --> 00:02:06.783
on the virtual touch pad
below each floating window.

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:09.318
Architects can stretch
or rotate the models

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:11.743
with their two hands directly.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.363
So in these examples,

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:16.100
we are reaching into the digital world.

00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:18.446
But how about reversing its role

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.265
and having the digital
information reach us instead?

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.337
I'm sure many of us
have had the experience

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.444
of buying and returning items online.

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:29.421
But now you don't have to worry about it.

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:34.059
What I got here is an online
augmented fitting room.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:35.961
This is a view that you get from

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.705
head-mounted or see-through display

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:42.852
when the system understands
the geometry of your body.

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:46.403
Taking this idea further,
I started to think,

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:49.772
instead of just seeing
these pixels in our space,

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.294
how can we make it physical

00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:55.556
so that we can touch and feel it?

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.605
What would such a future look like?

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.263
At MIT Media Lab,
along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:04.286
and my collaborator Rehmi Post,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.930
we created this one physical pixel.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.554
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:12.906
acts like a 3D pixel in our space,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.810
which means that both computers and people

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:17.708
can move this object to anywhere

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.677
within this little 3D space.

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:23.169
What we did was essentially
canceling gravity

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.308
and controlling the movement by combining

00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:28.132
magnetic levitation
and mechanical actuation

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:30.609
and sensing technologies.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:33.114
And by digitally programming the object,

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:35.891
we are liberating
the object from constraints

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:39.326
of time and space, which means that now,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.222
human motions can be
recorded and played back

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:46.841
and left permanently
in the physical world.

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:49.874
So choreography can be taught
physically over distance

00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:52.470
and Michael Jordan's famous
shooting can be replicated

00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:55.948
over and over as a physical reality.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:58.128
Students can use this as a tool

00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:00.070
to learn about the complex concepts

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:04.154
such as planetary motion, physics,

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:06.973
and unlike computer screens or textbooks,

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:09.455
this is a real, tangible experience

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.113
that you can touch and feel,
and it's very powerful.

00:04:13.137 --> 00:04:15.095
And what's more exciting

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.443
than just turning what's currently
in the computer physical

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.632
is to start imagining
how programming the world

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:25.352
will alter even our daily
physical activities.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.918
(Laughter)

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:32.675
As you can see, the digital information

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.193
will not just show us something

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:36.303
but it will start directly acting upon us

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:38.602
as a part of our physical surroundings

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:42.800
without disconnecting
ourselves from our world.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:47.146
Today, we started by talking
about the boundary,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.826
but if we remove this boundary,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.714
the only boundary left is our imagination.

00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:54.962
Thank you.

00:04:54.986 --> 00:05:00.071
(Applause)
