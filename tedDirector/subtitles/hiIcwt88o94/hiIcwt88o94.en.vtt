00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.840
We are stealing nature from our children.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.896
Now, when I say this, I don't mean
that we are destroying nature

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.296
that they will have wanted us to preserve,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.976
although that is
unfortunately also the case.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.816
What I mean here is that we've started
to define nature in a way

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.856
that's so purist and so strict

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.616
that under the definition
we're creating for ourselves,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.016
there won't be any nature
left for our children

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.240
when they're adults.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.656
But there's a fix for this.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.920
So let me explain.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.136
Right now, humans use half of the world

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.856
to live, to grow their crops
and their timber,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.776
to pasture their animals.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.616
If you added up all the human beings,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.880
we would weigh 10 times as much
as all the wild mammals put together.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.120
We cut roads through the forest.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.016
We have added little plastic particles
to the sand on ocean beaches.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.136
We've changed the chemistry of the soil
with our artificial fertilizers.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.376
And of course, we've changed
the chemistry of the air.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.256
So when you take your next breath,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.136
you'll be breathing in
42 percent more carbon dioxide

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.360
than if you were breathing in 1750.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.736
So all of these changes, and many others,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.840
have come to be kind of lumped together
under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.016
And this is a term
that some geologists are suggesting

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.856
we should give to our current epoch,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640
given how pervasive
human influence has been over it.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.176
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,
but I think it's a helpful way

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.880
to think about the magnitude
of human influence on the planet.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.496
So where does this put nature?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.240
What counts as nature in a world
where everything is influenced by humans?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.576
So 25 years ago, environmental writer
Bill McKibben said

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.096
that because nature
was a thing apart from man

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.696
and because climate change meant

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.336
that every centimeter of the Earth
was altered by man,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.456
then nature was over.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.840
In fact, he called his book
"The End of Nature."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.256
I disagree with this.
I just disagree with this.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.616
I disagree with this definition of nature,
because, fundamentally, we are animals.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.456
Right? Like, we evolved on this planet

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.576
in the context of all the other animals
with which we share a planet,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.176
and all the other plants,
and all the other microbes.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.496
And so I think that nature

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.576
is not that which is untouched
by humanity, man or woman.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.736
I think that nature
is anywhere where life thrives,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.776
anywhere where there are
multiple species together,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.016
anywhere that's green and blue
and thriving and filled with life

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.240
and growing.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.496
And under that definition,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.056
things look a little bit different.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.776
Now, I understand that there
are certain parts of this nature

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.416
that speak to us in a special way.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.096
Places like Yellowstone,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.816
or the Mongolian steppe,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.176
or the Great Barrier Reef

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.696
or the Serengeti.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.736
Places that we think of
as kind of Edenic representations

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.360
of a nature before
we screwed everything up.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.576
And in a way, they are less impacted
by our day to day activities.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.296
Many of these places
have no roads or few roads,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.896
so on, like such.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.696
But ultimately, even these Edens
are deeply influenced by humans.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.976
Now, let's just take
North America, for example,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.616
since that's where we're meeting.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.056
So between about 15,000 years ago
when people first came here,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.576
they started a process
of interacting with the nature

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.976
that led to the extinction
of a big slew of large-bodied animals,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.256
from the mastodon
to the giant ground sloth,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.536
saber-toothed cats,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.176
all of these cool animals
that unfortunately are no longer with us.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.016
And when those animals went extinct,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.616
you know, the ecosystems
didn't stand still.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.256
Massive ripple effects
changed grasslands into forests,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.080
changed the composition of forest
from one tree to another.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.656
So even in these Edens,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.496
even in these perfect-looking places

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.016
that seem to remind us
of a past before humans,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.120
we're essentially looking
at a humanized landscape.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.536
Not just these prehistoric humans,
but historical humans, indigenous people

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.800
all the way up until the moment
when the first colonizers showed up.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.256
And the case is the same
for the other continents as well.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.096
Humans have just been involved in nature

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.000
in a very influential way
for a very long time.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.216
Now, just recently, someone told me,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.096
"Oh, but there are still wild places."

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.336
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.256
And he said, "The Amazon."

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.736
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon.
I was just there.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.896
It's awesome. National Geographic
sent me to ManÃº National Park,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.496
which is in the Peruvian Amazon,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.176
but it's a big chunk of rainforest,
uncleared, no roads,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.816
protected as a national park,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.536
one of the most, in fact,
biodiverse parks in the world.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.680
And when I got in there with my canoe,
what did I find, but people.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.456
People have been living there
for hundreds and thousands of years.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.336
People live there, and they don't
just float over the jungle.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.960
They have a meaningful relationship
with the landscape.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.776
They hunt. They grow crops.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.296
They domesticate crops.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.216
They use the natural resources
to build their houses,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.496
to thatch their houses.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.536
They even make pets out of animals
that we consider to be wild animals.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.656
These people are there

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.776
and they're interacting
with the environment

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.296
in a way that's really meaningful
and that you can see in the environment.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.536
Now, I was with
an anthropologist on this trip,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.416
and he told me, as we were
floating down the river,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.096
he said, "There are
no demographic voids in the Amazon."

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.056
This statement has really stuck with me,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.936
because what it means
is that the whole Amazon is like this.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.240
There's people everywhere.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.216
And many other
tropical forests are the same,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.816
and not just tropical forests.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.056
People have influenced
ecosystems in the past,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.856
and they continue
to influence them in the present,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.040
even in places where
they're harder to notice.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.936
So, if all of the definitions of nature
that we might want to use

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.936
that involve it being
untouched by humanity

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.296
or not having people in it,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.656
if all of those actually give us
a result where we don't have any nature,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.096
then maybe they're the wrong definitions.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.616
Maybe we should define it
by the presence of multiple species,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.680
by the presence of a thriving life.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.456
Now, if we do it that way,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.936
what do we get?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.336
Well, it's this kind of miracle.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.640
All of a sudden,
there's nature all around us.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.856
All of a sudden,
we see this Monarch caterpillar

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.736
munching on this plant,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.576
and we realize that there it is,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.400
and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.656
And look at this empty lot.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.456
I mean, there's, like, probably,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.416
a dozen, minimum,
plant species growing there,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.696
supporting all kinds of insect life,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.056
and this is a completely unmanaged space,
a completely wild space.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.056
This is a kind of wild nature
right under our nose,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.560
that we don't even notice.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.976
And there's an interesting
little paradox, too.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.816
So this nature,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.496
this kind of wild, untended part

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.296
of our urban, peri-urban,
suburban agricultural existence

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.696
that flies under the radar,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.400
it's arguably more wild
than a national park,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.576
because national parks
are very carefully managed

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.336
in the 21st century.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.936
Crater Lake in southern Oregon,
which is my closest national park,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.136
is a beautiful example of a landscape
that seems to be coming out of the past.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.896
But they're managing it carefully.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.496
One of the issues they have now
is white bark pine die-off.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.016
White bark pine
is a beautiful, charismatic --

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.056
I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.736
that grows up at high altitude --

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.736
and it's got all these problems
right now with disease.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.896
There's a blister rust
that was introduced,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.416
bark beetle.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.016
So to deal with this,
the park service has been planting

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.760
rust-resistant white bark
pine seedlings in the park,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.600
even in areas that they are
otherwise managing as wilderness.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.016
And they're also putting out
beetle repellent in key areas

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.920
as I saw last time I went hiking there.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.976
And this kind of thing is really
much more common than you would think.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.696
National parks are heavily managed.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.776
The wildlife is kept to a certain
population size and structure.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.336
Fires are suppressed.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.656
Fires are started.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.856
Non-native species are removed.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.576
Native species are reintroduced.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.936
And in fact, I took a look,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.016
and Banff National Park
is doing all of the things I just listed:

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.496
suppressing fire, having fire,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.736
radio-collaring wolves,
reintroducing bison.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.976
It takes a lot of work to make
these places look untouched.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.056
(Laughter)

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.480
(Applause)

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.535
And in a further irony,
these places that we love the most

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.256
are the places that we love
a little too hard, sometimes.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.696
A lot of us like to go there,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.256
and because we're managing
them to be stable

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.336
in the face of a changing planet,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.760
they often are becoming
more fragile over time.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.896
Which means that they're
the absolute worst places

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.856
to take your children on vacation,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.776
because you can't do anything there.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.096
You can't climb the trees.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.336
You can't fish the fish.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.976
You can't make a campfire
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.656
You can't take home the pinecones.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.585
There are so many rules and restrictions

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.576
that from a child's point of view,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.400
this is, like, the worst nature ever.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.936
Because children don't want to hike

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.296
through a beautiful landscape
for five hours

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.176
and then look at a beautiful view.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200
That's maybe what we want to do as adults,

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:31.136
but what kids want to do
is hunker down in one spot

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.376
and just tinker with it,
just work with it,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.960
just pick it up, build a house,
build a fort, do something like that.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.696
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.976
are often distant from where people live.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.936
And they're expensive to get to.
They're hard to visit.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.736
So this means that they're
only available to the elites,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.360
and that's a real problem.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.376
The Nature Conservancy
did a survey of young people,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600
and they asked them, how often
do you spend time outdoors?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.656
And only two out of five
spent time outdoors

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.896
at least once a week.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.936
The other three out of five
were just staying inside.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.056
And when they asked them why,
what are the barriers to going outside,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.056
the response of 61 percent was,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.160
"There are no natural areas near my home."

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.896
And this is crazy.
This is just patently false.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.896
I mean, 71 percent of people in the US

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.696
live within a 10-minute walk
of a city park.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.376
And I'm sure the figures
are similar in other countries.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.536
And that doesn't even count
your back garden,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.520
the urban creek, the empty lot.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.056
Everybody lives near nature.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.736
Every kid lives near nature.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.816
We've just somehow
forgotten how to see it.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.016
We've spent too much time
watching David Attenborough documentaries

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.696
where the nature is really sexy --

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.736
(Laughter)

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.696
and we've forgotten how to see the nature
that is literally right outside our door,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.656
the nature of the street tree.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.456
So here's an example: Philadelphia.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.856
There's this cool elevated railway

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.296
that you can see from the ground,
that's been abandoned.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.736
Now, this may sound like the beginning
of the High Line story in Manhattan,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.056
and it's very similar, except they haven't
developed this into a park yet,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.616
although they're working on it.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.816
So for now, it's still this little
sort of secret wilderness

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.256
in the heart of Philadelphia,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.376
and if you know where the hole is
in the chain-link fence,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.456
you can scramble up to the top

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.296
and you can find this
completely wild meadow

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.480
just floating above
the city of Philadelphia.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.536
Every single one of these plants
grew from a seed

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.896
that planted itself there.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.856
This is completely autonomous,
self-willed nature.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.136
And it's right in the middle of the city.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.376
And they've sent people up there
to do sort of biosurveys,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.840
and there are over 50
plant species up there.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.816
And it's not just plants.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.336
This is an ecosystem,
a functioning ecosystem.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.816
It's creating soil.
It's sequestering carbon.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.736
There's pollination going on.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.720
I mean, this is really an ecosystem.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.256
So scientists have started calling
ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.856
because they're often
dominated by non-native species,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.616
and because they're just super weird.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.096
They're just unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.136
For so long, we dismissed
all these novel ecosystems as trash.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.576
We're talking about
regrown agricultural fields,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.176
timber plantations that are not
being managed on a day-to-day basis,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.856
second-growth forests generally,
the entire East Coast,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.016
where after agriculture moved west,
the forest sprung up.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.656
And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.496
where novel ecosystems are the norm,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.096
where exotic species totally dominate.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.536
This forest here has Queensland maple,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.400
it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.216
You can make your own
novel ecosystem, too.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.456
It's really simple.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.976
You just stop mowing your lawn.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.576
(Laughter)

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.296
Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland,
and he did this experiment himself.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.896
He just stopped mowing his lawn,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.456
and after a few years,
he had some grad students come,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.976
and they did sort of
a bio-blitz of his backyard,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.256
and they found 375 plant species,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.400
including two endangered species.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:06.016
So when you're up there
on that future High Line of Philadelphia,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.856
surrounded by this wildness,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.656
surrounded by this diversity,
this abundance, this vibrance,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.936
you can look over the side

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.216
and you can see a local playground
for a local school,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.176
and that's what it looks like.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.216
These children have, that --

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.696
You know, under my definition,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.096
there's a lot of the planet
that counts as nature,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.456
but this would be one of the few places
that wouldn't count as nature.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.856
There's nothing there except humans,
no other plants, no other animals.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.336
And what I really wanted to do

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.456
was just, like,
throw a ladder over the side

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.016
and get all these kids to come up with me
into this cool meadow.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.336
In a way, I feel like this is
the choice that faces us.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.960
If we dismiss these new natures
as not acceptable or trashy or no good,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.616
we might as well just pave them over.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.176
And in a world where
everything is changing,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.000
we need to be very careful
about how we define nature.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.856
In order not to steal it
from our children,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.816
we have to do two things.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.680
First, we cannot define nature
as that which is untouched.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.936
This never made any sense anyway.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.456
Nature has not been untouched
for thousands of years.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.296
And it excludes most of the nature
that most people can visit

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.296
and have a relationship with,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.720
including only nature
that children cannot touch.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.976
Which brings me to the second thing
that we have to do,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.496
which is that we have to
let children touch nature,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.016
because that which
is untouched is unloved.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.000
(Applause)

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.136
We face some pretty grim
environmental challenges on this planet.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.696
Climate change is among them.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.216
There's others too:
habitat loss is my favorite thing

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.936
to freak out about
in the middle of the night.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.296
But in order to solve them,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.056
we need people --
smart, dedicated people --

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.856
who care about nature.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.856
And the only way we're going to raise up
a generation of people

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.096
who care about nature

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.296
is by letting them touch nature.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.616
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.536
Fort Theory of Conservation.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.776
Every ecologist I know,
every conservation biologist I know,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.696
every conservation professional I know,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.920
built forts when they were kids.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.776
If we have a generation
that doesn't know how to build a fort,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.976
we'll have a generation that doesn't
know how to care about nature.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.256
And I don't want
to be the one to tell this kid,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.616
who is on a special program

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.096
that takes Philadelphia kids
from poor neighborhoods

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.536
and takes them to city parks,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.736
I don't want to be the one to tell him
that the flower he's holding

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.840
is a non-native invasive weed
that he should throw away as trash.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.936
I think I would much rather
learn from this boy

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.616
that no matter
where this plant comes from,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.816
it is beautiful, and it deserves
to be touched and appreciated.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.056
Thank you.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:51.270
(Applause)
