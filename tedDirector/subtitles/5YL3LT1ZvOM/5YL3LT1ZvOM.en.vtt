00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:20.358
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:23.069
had a very successful perfume business.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.326
For over 50 years she ran it.

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:28.111
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — (Laughter) —

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:33.542
for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.408
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:40.732
but as a poison, it was the best money could buy,

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.525
so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:49.785
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:53.954
because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:57.289
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.553
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:03.124
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:05.687
of a bitter substance or a sour substance,

00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:09.459
and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.331
as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.283
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:18.803
sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:21.255
about whether or not we're about to be poisoned,

00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:24.212
but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:28.343
from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:32.296
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.477
from physical contaminants, and there's a growing

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.960
body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.002
of disgust now influences our moral beliefs

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.898
and even our deeply held political intuitions.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:48.534
Why this might be the case?

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:51.529
We can understand this process by understanding

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.679
a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.874
those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,

00:01:57.874 --> 00:02:00.675
exist because they motivate us to do good things

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:02.986
and they keep us away from doing bad things.

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:06.369
So by and large, they are good for our survival.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.178
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:11.682
from doing things that are really, really risky.

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:15.522
This photo taken just before his death — (Laughter) —

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:18.368
is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:21.985
is because most people would not do this, and if they did,

00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:23.985
they would not live to tell it, because fear would have

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.660
kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.267
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:33.601
to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.196
keeps us away from not things that might eat us,

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.861
or heights, but rather things that might poison us,

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:41.458
or give us disease and make us sick.

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.715
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:49.498
an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,

00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:52.381
in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.750
and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.633
I can probably make you feel disgust.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.828
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.

00:02:59.828 --> 00:03:00.961
(Laughter)

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:05.294
I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:06.507
(Audience: Ewww.)

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:09.516
Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:12.051
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:15.886
feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:18.416
I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:21.099
sort of across the world to make people disgusted,

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.703
things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.537
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense

00:03:26.537 --> 00:03:29.791
for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:32.086
In fact, just having a diseased appearance

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:34.486
or odd sexual acts, these things are also

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:37.477
things that give us a lot of disgust.

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:39.855
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:41.798
to systematically investigate the human emotions,

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:45.487
and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength

00:03:45.487 --> 00:03:47.336
of the disgust response.

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:50.607
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:52.343
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:54.848
some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...

00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:58.367
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt

00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:01.365
utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — (Laughter) —

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:03.522
though his hands did not appear dirty."

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:08.920
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages." (Laughter)

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.664
Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists

00:04:11.664 --> 00:04:13.945
who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance

00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:16.235
to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:20.102
and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:22.467
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex,

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:25.489
are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:30.189
that are hard to jettison overnight."

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.226
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.869
Professor Dawkins actually gagged.

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.454
He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:44.010
and all three times he gagged. (Laughter)

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.156
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:50.372
One of the features, though, of disgust,

00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:53.302
is not just its universality and its strength,

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:56.341
but the way that it works through association.

00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:00.076
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:03.430
that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.637
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to

00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:08.403
convince somebody that an object or an individual

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:12.071
or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.

00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:14.612
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out

00:05:14.612 --> 00:05:16.696
in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust

00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:19.937
properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness --

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:22.237
have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:26.089
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people --

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.603
all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."

00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:32.735
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful

00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:35.107
examples of how this has been used historically.

00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:38.697
This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:

00:05:38.697 --> 00:05:41.507
"Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.817
the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:47.583
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:50.376
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:52.909
A more modern example comes from people who try to

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.370
convince us that homosexuality is immoral.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.055
This is from an anti-gay website, where they said

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:02.332
gays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:05.998
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.742
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly

00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:12.091
linked to the social group that you should not like.

00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:14.863
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:18.732
moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:23.035
was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely

00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:26.100
to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.229
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.845
are universal phenomena, it just really is true

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:33.143
that some people are easier to disgust than others.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.829
You could probably see it in the audience members

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:36.886
when I showed you those disgusting images.

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:39.586
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:41.915
constructed by some other psychologists

00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:44.772
that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations

00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:46.873
how likely they are to feel disgust.

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.666
So here are a couple of examples.

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:50.838
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:54.646
favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."

00:06:54.646 --> 00:06:56.211
"Do you agree or disagree?" (Laughter)

00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.491
"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,

00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.155
you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.811
If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall

00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:07.174
score of disgust sensitivity.

00:07:07.174 --> 00:07:09.647
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.

00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:12.724
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:16.553
them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors

00:07:16.553 --> 00:07:21.575
like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:25.540
or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.531
your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.874
you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.

00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:33.472
The first time that we set out to collect data on this

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:35.482
and associate it with political or moral beliefs,

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:38.359
we found a general pattern --

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:41.661
this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom --

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.681
that in fact, across three studies we kept finding

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:48.202
that people who reported that they were easily disgusted

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.657
also reported that they were more politically conservative.

00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:53.541
Another way to say this, though, is that people

00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:58.948
who are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)

00:07:58.948 --> 00:08:03.218
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at

00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:05.899
a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:08.491
this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,

00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:11.268
and we find the same pattern. As you can see,

00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:13.213
people who are on the very conservative side

00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:15.915
of answering the political orientation scale are

00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:18.685
also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:21.180
This data set also allowed us to statistically control

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.404
for a number of things that we knew were both related

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:26.319
to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.924
So we were able to control for gender, age, income,

00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:32.215
education, even basic personality variables,

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:34.517
and the result stays the same.

00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:37.943
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,

00:08:37.943 --> 00:08:40.843
but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically

00:08:40.843 --> 00:08:43.789
across the nation. What we found was that in regions

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.686
in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:49.673
McCain got more votes.

00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.791
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,

00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.163
but actual voting behavior. And also we were able,

00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:57.855
with this sample, to look across the world,

00:08:57.855 --> 00:09:01.449
in 121 different countries we asked the same questions,

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:05.376
and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:07.746
into 10 different geographical regions.

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.370
No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.781
of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,

00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:17.420
and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.857
Other labs have actually looked at this as well

00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:23.034
using different measures of disgust sensitivity,

00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:25.586
so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:27.926
they hook people up to physiological measures,

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.554
in this case skin conductance.

00:09:29.554 --> 00:09:31.782
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:35.908
being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:39.482
when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:41.651
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding

00:09:41.651 --> 00:09:45.676
that we kept getting in our previous studies as well

00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:49.423
was that one of the strongest influences here is that

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.633
individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.719
more likely to report being politically conservative, but

00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:56.728
they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:58.877
and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of

00:09:58.877 --> 00:10:02.642
the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.

00:10:02.642 --> 00:10:06.131
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study,

00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:07.829
attitudes toward gay marriage.

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:11.048
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:14.207
and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is

00:10:14.207 --> 00:10:17.278
what is the causal link here? Is it the case that

00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:20.552
disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:23.112
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:25.887
and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab

00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:28.310
and disgust them and compare them to a control group

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.718
that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over

00:10:30.718 --> 00:10:33.446
the past five years a number of researchers have done this,

00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.272
and by and large the results have all been the same,

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:38.701
that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:40.804
shift towards the right of the political spectrum,

00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:43.480
toward more moral conservatism as well.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.160
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.450
from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.816
images like the ones I've shown you, even just

00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:56.779
reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.418
be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,

00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:03.198
these all have similar effects on judgment.

00:11:03.198 --> 00:11:05.564
Let me just give you an example from a recent study

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:08.524
that we conducted. We asked participants

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:13.221
to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.633
and we either made the room smell gross or not.

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:20.804
When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that

00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:24.475
individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.698
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other

00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:29.091
social groups that we asked, including African-Americans,

00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:32.953
the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had

00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:34.346
toward gay men.

00:11:34.346 --> 00:11:37.907
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people --

00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:39.833
this was at a time when the swine flu was going around --

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.317
we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread

00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:46.035
of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.

00:11:46.035 --> 00:11:50.450
For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.371
next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.

00:11:53.371 --> 00:11:55.891
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire

00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:59.604
next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals

00:11:59.604 --> 00:12:02.767
report being more politically conservative.

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.804
And when we asked them a variety of questions about

00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:08.227
the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.542
found was that simply being reminded that they ought

00:12:10.542 --> 00:12:13.851
to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.

00:12:13.851 --> 00:12:16.148
In particular, when we asked them questions about

00:12:16.148 --> 00:12:19.922
sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,

00:12:19.922 --> 00:12:22.548
just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands

00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:25.111
made them think that they were more morally wrong.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.511
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless

00:12:27.511 --> 00:12:30.276
but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:34.034
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.

00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:36.752
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:38.100
on his grandma's bed.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.597
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:44.491
with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)

00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:47.123
People find these to be more morally abhorrent

00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:51.439
if they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:54.631
(Laughter)

00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:58.160
Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.043
should come as no surprise. I mean,

00:13:00.043 --> 00:13:01.444
that's part of how emotions work.

00:13:01.444 --> 00:13:03.008
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,

00:13:03.008 --> 00:13:05.092
but they change the way you think.

00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:07.882
In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising

00:13:07.882 --> 00:13:11.327
is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,

00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:14.206
and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust

00:13:14.206 --> 00:13:16.862
would make me change the way that I perceive

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:19.905
the physical world whenever contamination is possible.

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:22.837
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built

00:13:22.837 --> 00:13:25.743
to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict

00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:29.119
who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:31.927
The question of whether disgust ought to influence

00:13:31.927 --> 00:13:34.279
our moral and political judgments

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:37.415
certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:40.097
what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,

00:13:40.097 --> 00:13:42.103
we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method

00:13:42.103 --> 00:13:45.607
is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.

00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:47.655
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is,

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:50.474
at the very least, what we can do with this research is

00:13:50.474 --> 00:13:53.326
point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.

00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:57.326
Thank you. (Applause)
