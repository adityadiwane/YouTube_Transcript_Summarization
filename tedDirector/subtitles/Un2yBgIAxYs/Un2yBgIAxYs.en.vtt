00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.200
Imagine you're walking through a forest.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.096
I'm guessing you're thinking
of a collection of trees,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.856
what we foresters call a stand,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.520
with their rugged stems
and their beautiful crowns.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.920
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960
but a forest is much more
than what you see,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.240
and today I want to change
the way you think about forests.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.256
You see, underground
there is this other world,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.336
a world of infinite biological pathways

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.776
that connect trees
and allow them to communicate

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.280
and allow the forest to behave
as though it's a single organism.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.760
It might remind you
of a sort of intelligence.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.256
How do I know this?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.520
Here's my story.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.720
I grew up in the forests
of British Columbia.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.256
I used to lay on the forest floor
and stare up at the tree crowns.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.520
They were giants.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.896
My grandfather was a giant, too.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.376
He was a horse logger,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.960
and he used to selectively cut
cedar poles from the inland rainforest.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.736
Grandpa taught me about the quiet
and cohesive ways of the woods,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160
and how my family was knit into it.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.216
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.800
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.936
and my first big "aha" moment

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.840
was at the outhouse by our lake.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.760
Our poor dog Jigs
had slipped and fallen into the pit.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.216
So grandpa ran up with his shovel
to rescue the poor dog.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480
He was down there, swimming in the muck.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.696
But as grandpa dug
through that forest floor,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.336
I became fascinated with the roots,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.456
and under that, what I learned later
was the white mycelium

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.560
and under that the red
and yellow mineral horizons.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.416
Eventually, grandpa and I
rescued the poor dog,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.776
but it was at that moment that I realized

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.376
that that palette of roots and soil

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.840
was really the foundation of the forest.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.040
And I wanted to know more.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.400
So I studied forestry.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.056
But soon I found myself working
alongside the powerful people

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.960
in charge of the commercial harvest.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.536
The extent of the clear-cutting

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.816
was alarming,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.000
and I soon found myself
conflicted by my part in it.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.696
Not only that, the spraying
and hacking of the aspens and birches

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.016
to make way for the more commercially
valuable planted pines and firs

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.240
was astounding.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.760
It seemed that nothing could stop
this relentless industrial machine.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.040
So I went back to school,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.320
and I studied my other world.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.736
You see, scientists had just discovered
in the laboratory in vitro

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.896
that one pine seedling root

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.320
could transmit carbon
to another pine seedling root.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.936
But this was in the laboratory,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.016
and I wondered,
could this happen in real forests?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.240
I thought yes.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.080
Trees in real forests might also
share information below ground.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.896
But this was really controversial,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.536
and some people thought I was crazy,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.616
and I had a really hard time
getting research funding.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.080
But I persevered,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.056
and I eventually conducted
some experiments deep in the forest,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.480
25 years ago.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.016
I grew 80 replicates of three species:

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.216
paper birch, Douglas fir,
and western red cedar.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.296
I figured the birch and the fir
would be connected in a belowground web,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.576
but not the cedar.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120
It was in its own other world.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.296
And I gathered my apparatus,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.496
and I had no money,
so I had to do it on the cheap.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.136
So I went to Canadian Tire --

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.576
(Laughter)

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.016
and I bought some plastic bags
and duct tape and shade cloth,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.280
a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.336
And then I borrowed some
high-tech stuff from my university:

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.976
a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,
a mass spectrometer, microscopes.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.456
And then I got some
really dangerous stuff:

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.256
syringes full of radioactive
carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.296
and some high pressure bottles

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.840
of the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.136
But I was legally permitted.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.856
(Laughter)

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.480
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.800
important stuff: the bug spray,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.440
the bear spray,
the filters for my respirator.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.360
Oh well.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.336
The first day of the experiment,
we got out to our plot

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.160
and a grizzly bear and her cub
chased us off.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.440
And I had no bear spray.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.296
But you know, this is how
forest research in Canada goes.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.776
(Laughter)

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.336
So I came back the next day,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.616
and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.656
So this time, we really got started,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.456
and I pulled on my white paper suit,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.320
I put on my respirator,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.376
and then

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.680
I put the plastic bags over my trees.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.176
I got my giant syringes,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.856
and I injected the bags

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.296
with my tracer isotope
carbon dioxide gases,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.536
first the birch.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.536
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.136
into the bag of birch.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.416
And then for fir,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.256
I injected the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.016
I used two isotopes,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.296
because I was wondering

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.160
whether there was two-way communication
going on between these species.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.216
I got to the final bag,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.736
the 80th replicate,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.176
and all of a sudden
mama grizzly showed up again.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.616
And she started to chase me,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.056
and I had my syringes above my head,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.016
and I was swatting the mosquitos,
and I jumped into the truck,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.256
and I thought,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.016
"This is why people do lab studies."

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.480
(Laughter)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.616
I waited an hour.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.256
I figured it would take this long

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.056
for the trees to suck up
the CO2 through photosynthesis,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.216
turn it into sugars,
send it down into their roots,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.936
and maybe, I hypothesized,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.760
shuttle that carbon belowground
to their neighbors.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.776
After the hour was up,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.376
I rolled down my window,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.000
and I checked for mama grizzly.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh good, she's over there
eating her huckleberries.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.336
So I got out of the truck
and I got to work.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.256
I went to my first bag with the birch.
I pulled the bag off.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.600
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.480
Kkhh!

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.616
Perfect.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.576
The birch had taken up
the radioactive gas.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.176
Then the moment of truth.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.720
I went over to the fir tree.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.096
I pulled off its bag.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.456
I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.680
and I heard the most beautiful sound.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.640
Kkhh!

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.496
It was the sound of birch talking to fir,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.976
and birch was saying,
"Hey, can I help you?"

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.616
And fir was saying, "Yeah,
can you send me some of your carbon?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.040
Because somebody
threw a shade cloth over me."

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.056
I went up to cedar, and I ran
the Geiger counter over its leaves,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.600
and as I suspected,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.760
silence.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.776
Cedar was in its own world.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.760
It was not connected into the web
interlinking birch and fir.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.120
I was so excited,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.976
I ran from plot to plot
and I checked all 80 replicates.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.136
The evidence was clear.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.096
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.240
that paper birch and Douglas fir
were in a lively two-way conversation.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.816
It turns out at that time of the year,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.056
in the summer,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.736
that birch was sending more carbon to fir
than fir was sending back to birch,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.056
especially when the fir was shaded.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.056
And then in later experiments,
we found the opposite,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.616
that fir was sending more carbon to birch
than birch was sending to fir,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.280
and this was because the fir was still
growing while the birch was leafless.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.536
So it turns out the two species
were interdependent,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.840
like yin and yang.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.936
And at that moment,
everything came into focus for me.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.216
I knew I had found something big,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.976
something that would change the way
we look at how trees interact in forests,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.016
from not just competitors

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.720
but to cooperators.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.256
And I had found solid evidence

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.656
of this massive belowground
communications network,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.920
the other world.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.856
Now, I truly hoped and believed

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.496
that my discovery would change
how we practice forestry,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.296
from clear-cutting and herbiciding

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.256
to more holistic and sustainable methods,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.496
methods that were less expensive
and more practical.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.760
What was I thinking?

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.200
I'll come back to that.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.600
So how do we do science
in complex systems like forests?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.056
Well, as forest scientists,
we have to do our research in the forests,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.096
and that's really tough,
as I've shown you.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.360
And we have to be really good
at running from bears.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.336
But mostly, we have to persevere

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.256
in spite of all the stuff
stacked against us.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.896
And we have to follow our intuition
and our experiences

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.056
and ask really good questions.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.256
And then we've got to gather our data
and then go verify.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.440
For me, I've conducted and published
hundreds of experiments in the forest.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.080
Some of my oldest experimental plantations
are now over 30 years old.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.456
You can check them out.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.280
That's how forest science works.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.536
So now I want to talk about the science.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.616
How were paper birch
and Douglas fir communicating?

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.136
Well, it turns out they were conversing
not only in the language of carbon

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.176
but also nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.936
and water and defense signals
and allele chemicals and hormones --

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.160
information.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.336
And you know, I have to tell you,
before me, scientists had thought

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.936
that this belowground
mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.456
was involved.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.560
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.256
You see their reproductive organs
when you walk through the forest.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.096
They're the mushrooms.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.136
The mushrooms, though,
are just the tip of the iceberg,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.416
because coming out of those stems
are fungal threads that form a mycelium,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.136
and that mycelium
infects and colonizes the roots

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.296
of all the trees and plants.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.976
And where the fungal cells
interact with the root cells,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.776
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.856
and that fungus gets those nutrients
by growing through the soil

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880
and coating every soil particle.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.136
The web is so dense that there can be
hundreds of kilometers of mycelium

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.720
under a single footstep.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.520
And not only that, that mycelium connects
different individuals in the forest,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.936
individuals not only of the same species
but between species, like birch and fir,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.280
and it works kind of like the Internet.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.656
You see, like all networks,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.496
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.576
We made this map by examining
the short sequences of DNA

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.096
of every tree and every fungal individual
in a patch of Douglas fir forest.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.936
In this picture, the circles represent
the Douglas fir, or the nodes,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.080
and the lines represent the interlinking
fungal highways, or the links.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.456
The biggest, darkest nodes
are the busiest nodes.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.416
We call those hub trees,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.856
or more fondly, mother trees,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.496
because it turns out
that those hub trees nurture their young,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.056
the ones growing in the understory.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.216
And if you can see those yellow dots,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.536
those are the young seedlings
that have established within the network

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.800
of the old mother trees.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.600
In a single forest, a mother tree can be
connected to hundreds of other trees.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.096
And using our isotope tracers,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.616
we have found that mother trees

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.576
will send their excess carbon
through the mycorrhizal network

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.536
to the understory seedlings,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.696
and we've associated this
with increased seedling survival

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.960
by four times.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.096
Now, we know we all
favor our own children,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.360
and I wondered, could Douglas fir
recognize its own kin,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
like mama grizzly and her cub?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.376
So we set about an experiment,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.296
and we grew mother trees
with kin and stranger's seedlings.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.216
And it turns out
they do recognize their kin.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.216
Mother trees colonize their kin
with bigger mycorrhizal networks.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.656
They send them more carbon below ground.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.256
They even reduce
their own root competition

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.136
to make elbow room for their kids.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.816
When mother trees are injured or dying,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.360
they also send messages of wisdom
on to the next generation of seedlings.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.656
So we've used isotope tracing

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.256
to trace carbon moving
from an injured mother tree

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.616
down her trunk
into the mycorrhizal network

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.640
and into her neighboring seedlings,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.416
not only carbon but also defense signals.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.256
And these two compounds

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.376
have increased the resistance
of those seedlings to future stresses.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.680
So trees talk.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.576
(Applause)

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.800
Thank you.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.736
Through back and forth conversations,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.440
they increase the resilience
of the whole community.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.256
It probably reminds you
of our own social communities,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.856
and our families,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.261
well, at least some families.

00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:11.496
(Laughter)

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.425
So let's come back to the initial point.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.936
Forests aren't simply
collections of trees,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.496
they're complex systems
with hubs and networks

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.016
that overlap and connect trees
and allow them to communicate,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.816
and they provide avenues
for feedbacks and adaptation,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.256
and this makes the forest resilient.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.656
That's because there are many hub trees
and many overlapping networks.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.656
But they're also vulnerable,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.560
vulnerable not only
to natural disturbances

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.896
like bark beetles that preferentially
attack big old trees

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.360
but high-grade logging
and clear-cut logging.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.056
You see, you can take out
one or two hub trees,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.800
but there comes a tipping point,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.856
because hub trees are not
unlike rivets in an airplane.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.416
You can take out one or two
and the plane still flies,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.016
but you take out one too many,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.656
or maybe that one holding on the wings,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.520
and the whole system collapses.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.896
So now how are you thinking
about forests? Differently?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.136
(Audience) Yes.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.360
Cool.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.240
I'm glad.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.776
So, remember I said earlier
that I hoped that my research,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.176
my discoveries would change
the way we practice forestry.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.320
Well, I want to take a check on that
30 years later here in western Canada.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.376
This is about 100 kilometers
to the west of us,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.760
just on the border of Banff National Park.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.560
That's a lot of clear-cuts.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.460
It's not so pristine.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:51.036
In 2014, the World Resources Institute
reported that Canada in the past decade

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.660
has had the highest forest disturbance
rate of any country worldwide,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.340
and I bet you thought it was Brazil.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.676
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.620
Now, by my estimation, that's about
four times the rate that is sustainable.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.436
Now, massive disturbance at this scale
is known to affect hydrological cycles,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.436
degrade wildlife habitat,

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.356
and emit greenhouse gases
back into the atmosphere,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.300
which creates more disturbance
and more tree diebacks.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.276
Not only that, we're continuing
to plant one or two species

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.260
and weed out the aspens and birches.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.836
These simplified forests lack complexity,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.276
and they're really vulnerable
to infections and bugs.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.196
And as climate changes,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.500
this is creating a perfect storm

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.996
for extreme events, like the massive
mountain pine beetle outbreak

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.060
that just swept across North America,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.140
or that megafire in the last
couple months in Alberta.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.300
So I want to come back
to my final question:

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.756
instead of weakening our forests,

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.340
how can we reinforce them
and help them deal with climate change?

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.716
Well, you know, the great thing
about forests as complex systems

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.780
is they have enormous
capacity to self-heal.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.116
In our recent experiments,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.596
we found with patch-cutting
and retention of hub trees

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.756
and regeneration to a diversity
of species and genes and genotypes

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.620
that these mycorrhizal networks,
they recover really rapidly.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.276
So with this in mind, I want to leave you
with four simple solutions.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.660
And we can't kid ourselves
that these are too complicated to act on.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.380
First, we all need
to get out in the forest.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.036
We need to reestablish
local involvement in our own forests.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.676
You see, most of our forests now

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.916
are managed using
a one-size-fits-all approach,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.300
but good forest stewardship
requires knowledge of local conditions.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.100
Second, we need to save
our old-growth forests.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:04.740
These are the repositories of genes
and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.876
So this means less cutting.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.940
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.635
And third, when we do cut,

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.460
we need to save the legacies,

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.716
the mother trees and networks,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.875
and the wood, the genes,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.796
so they can pass their wisdom
onto the next generation of trees

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.940
so they can withstand
the future stresses coming down the road.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.700
We need to be conservationists.

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:34.539
And finally, fourthly and finally,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.796
we need to regenerate our forests
with a diversity of species

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.036
and genotypes and structures

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.820
by planting and allowing
natural regeneration.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.516
We have to give Mother Nature
the tools she needs

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.260
to use her intelligence to self-heal.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.236
And we need to remember
that forests aren't just a bunch of trees

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.516
competing with each other,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.460
they're supercooperators.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.356
So back to Jigs.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.836
Jigs's fall into the outhouse
showed me this other world,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.556
and it changed my view of forests.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.916
I hope today to have changed
how you think about forests.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.196
Thank you.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.997
(Applause)
