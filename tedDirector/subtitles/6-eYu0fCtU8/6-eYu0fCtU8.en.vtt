00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.096
I'm a painter.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.696
I make large-scale figurative paintings,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.120
which means I paint people

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.039
like this.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.616
But I'm here tonight to tell you
about something personal

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.320
that changed my work and my perspective.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.216
It's something we all go through,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.840
and my hope is that my experience
may be helpful to somebody.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.096
To give you some background on me,
I grew up the youngest of eight.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.296
Yes, eight kids in my family.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.656
I have six older brothers and a sister.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.880
To give you a sense of what that's like,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.736
when my family went on vacation,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.456
we had a bus.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.680
(Laughter)

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.656
My supermom would drive us all over town

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.416
to our various after-school activities --

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.640
not in the bus.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.640
We had a regular car, too.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.736
She would take me to art classes,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.016
and not just one or two.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.616
She took me to every available art class
from when I was eight to 16,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.280
because that's all I wanted to do.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400
She even took a class with me
in New York City.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.736
Now, being the youngest of eight,
I learned a few survival skills.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.296
Rule number one:

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280
don't let your big brother
see you do anything stupid.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.096
So I learned to be quiet and neat

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.760
and careful to follow the rules
and stay in line.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.616
But painting was where I made the rules.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.280
That was my private world.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.440
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.200
My big plan was to be a waitress
to support my painting.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.296
So I continued honing my skills.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.456
I went to graduate school
and I got an MFA,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.776
and at my first solo show,
my brother asked me,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.776
"What do all these red dots
mean next to the paintings?"

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
Nobody was more surprised than me.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.016
The red dots meant
that the paintings were sold

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.136
and that I'd be able to pay my rent

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.480
with painting.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.376
Now, my apartment
had four electrical outlets,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.696
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.960
but still, I could pay my rent.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.680
So I was very happy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120
Here's a painting
from back around that time.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.536
I needed it to be
as realistic as possible.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.960
It had to be specific and believable.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.720
This was the place where I was
isolated and in total control.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.376
Since then, I've made a career
of painting people in water.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.416
Bathtubs and showers were
the perfect enclosed environment.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.176
It was intimate and private,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.416
and water was this complicated challenge
that kept me busy for a decade.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.976
I made about 200 of these paintings,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.720
some of them six to eight feet,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.680
like this one.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.736
For this painting, I mixed flour in
with the bathwater to make it cloudy

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.736
and I floated cooking oil on the surface

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.096
and stuck a girl in it,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.736
and when I lit it up,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520
it was so beautiful
I couldn't wait to paint it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.760
I was driven by this
kind of impulsive curiosity,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.496
always looking for something new to add:

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.480
vinyl, steam, glass.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.776
I once put all this Vaseline
in my head and hair

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.640
just to see what that would look like.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.416
Don't do that.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.880
(Laughter)

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.816
So it was going well.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120
I was finding my way.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.776
I was eager and motivated

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.280
and surrounded by artists,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.800
always going to openings and events.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.216
I was having some success and recognition

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.600
and I moved into an apartment
with more than four outlets.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.136
My mom and I would stay up very late

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.296
talking about our latest ideas
and inspiring each other.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.040
She made beautiful pottery.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.416
I have a friend named Bo
who made this painting

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.816
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.507
and he called it "The Light Years."

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.576
I asked him what that meant, and he said,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.160
"Well, that's when you've stepped
into adulthood, you're no longer a child,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.320
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.720
That was it. It was the light years.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.536
On October 8, 2011,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.616
the light years came to an end.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.520
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.610
It had spread to her bones,
and it was in her brain.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.935
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.200
I totally lost it.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.136
And when I got myself together
and I looked at her,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.736
I realized, this isn't about me.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.800
This is about figuring out
how to help her.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.416
My father is a doctor,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.016
and so we had a great advantage
having him in charge,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.200
and he did a beautiful job
taking care of her.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.496
But I, too, wanted to do
everything I could to help,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.096
so I wanted to try everything.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.320
We all did.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.656
I researched alternative medicines,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.760
diets, juicing, acupuncture.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.976
Finally, I asked her,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.600
"Is this what you want me to do?"

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.520
And she said, "No."

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.480
She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.896
She knew what was happening,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.336
and she knew what the doctors

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.856
and the experts
and the internet didn't know:

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.840
how she wanted to go through this.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.840
I just needed to ask her.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.936
I realized that if I tried to fix it,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.160
I would miss it.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.056
So I just started to be with her,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.480
whatever that meant
and whatever situation came up,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.760
just really listen to her.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.360
If before I was resisting,
then now I was surrendering,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.816
giving up trying to control
the uncontrollable

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.400
and just being there in it with her.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.960
Time slowed down,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.360
and the date was irrelevant.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.480
We developed a routine.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.760
Early each morning I would crawl
into bed with her and sleep with her.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.856
My brother would come for breakfast

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.656
and we'd be so glad to hear
his car coming up the driveway.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.440
So I'd help her up and take both her hands

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.120
and help her walk to the kitchen.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.216
She had this huge mug she made

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.040
she loved to drink her coffee out of,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.960
and she loved Irish soda bread
for breakfast.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.976
Afterwards was the shower,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.256
and she loved this part.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.816
She loved the warm water,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.296
so I made this as indulgent as I could,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.520
like a spa.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.096
My sister would help sometimes.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.416
We had warm towels

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.576
and slippers ready immediately

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.560
so she never got cold for a second.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.200
I'd blow-dry her hair.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.056
My brothers would come in the evenings
and bring their kids,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.920
and that was the highlight of her day.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.400
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.776
and she didn't want to eat so much,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.960
and she used the tiniest little teacup
we could find to drink her coffee.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.976
I couldn't support her myself anymore,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.280
so we hired an aide
to help me with the showers.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.056
These simple daily activities

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.840
became our sacred ritual,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.736
and we repeated them day after day

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.960
as the cancer grew.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.696
It was humbling and painful

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.720
and exactly where I wanted to be.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.440
We called this time "the beautiful awful."

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.976
She died on October 26, 2012.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.680
It was a year and three weeks
after her diagnosis.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.960
She was gone.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.496
My brothers, sister, and father and I

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.120
all came together in this
supportive and attentive way.

00:07:47.903 --> 00:07:49.856
It was as though our whole family dynamic

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.936
and all our established roles vanished

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.616
and we were just
all together in this unknown,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.496
feeling the same thing

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.000
and taking care of each other.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.920
I'm so grateful for them.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.776
As someone who spends most
of my time alone in a studio working,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.656
I had no idea that this kind of connection

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.616
could be so important, so healing.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.440
This was the most important thing.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.520
It was what I always wanted.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.920
So after the funeral, it was time
for me to go back to my studio.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.416
So I packed up my car
and I drove back to Brooklyn,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.360
and painting is what I've always done,
so that's what I did.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.680
And here's what happened.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.480
It's like a release of everything
that was unraveling in me.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:50.895
That safe, very, very carefully
rendered safe place

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:53.856
that I created in all my other paintings,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.135
it was a myth.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.360
It didn't work.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.080
And I was afraid, because
I didn't want to paint anymore.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.576
So I went into the woods.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.216
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.056
I got my paints,
and I wasn't a landscape painter,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.696
but I wasn't really
much of any kind of painter at all,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.216
so I had no attachment, no expectation,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.296
which allowed me to be reckless and free.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.376
I actually left one of these wet paintings

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.320
outside overnight

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.176
next to a light in the woods.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.160
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.136
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.536
I took all these paintings
back to my studio,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.216
and scraped them, and carved into them,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.736
and poured paint thinner on them,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.056
put more paint on top, drew on them.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.280
I had no plan,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.130
but I was watching what was happening.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.585
This is the one with all the bugs in it.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.096
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.576
It was the chaos and the imperfections
that were fascinating me,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.280
and something started to happen.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.160
I got curious again.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.520
This is another one from the woods.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.136
There was a caveat now, though.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.096
I couldn't be controlling
the paint like I used to.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.136
It had to be about implying
and suggesting,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.880
not explaining or describing.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.016
And that imperfect,
chaotic, turbulent surface

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.840
is what told the story.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.440
I started to be as curious
as I was when I was a student.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.096
So the next thing was I wanted
to put figures in these paintings, people,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.896
and I loved this new environment,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.200
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.896
When the idea hit me of how to do this,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.696
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.576
which is really just adrenaline, probably,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.536
but for me it's a really good sign.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.696
And so now I want to show you
what I've been working on.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.776
It's something I haven't shown yet,
and it's like a preview, I guess,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.056
of my upcoming show,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.280
what I have so far.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.960
Expansive space

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.080
instead of the isolated bathtub.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.640
I'm going outside instead of inside.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.680
Loosening control,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.896
savoring the imperfections,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.120
allowing the --

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.840
allowing the imperfections.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.336
And in that imperfection,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.256
you can find a vulnerability.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.440
I could feel my deepest intention,
what matters most to me,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.200
that human connection

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.320
that can happen in a space
where there's no resisting or controlling.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.275
I want to make paintings about that.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.560
So here's what I learned.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.240
We're all going to have
big losses in our lives,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.056
maybe a job or a career,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.360
relationships, love, our youth.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.736
We're going to lose our health,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.960
people we love.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.656
These kinds of losses
are out of our control.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.880
They're unpredictable,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.320
and they bring us to our knees.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.520
And so I say, let them.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.400
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.640
Let go of trying to change it

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.960
or even wanting it to be different.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.800
It just is.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.616
And then there's space,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.816
and in that space feel your vulnerability,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.536
what matters most to you,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.240
your deepest intention.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.320
And be curious to connect

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.720
to what and who is really here,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.240
awake and alive.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.480
It's what we all want.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920
Let's take the opportunity
to find something beautiful

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.680
in the unknown, in the unpredictable,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.080
and even in the awful.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.536
Thank you.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.639
(Applause)
