00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.117
"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.

00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:25.665
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:28.655
I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.569
because it ain't about being heard, just being seen.

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.706
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:38.325
my fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.874
Ain't nobody who looks as good as me,

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.250
but this costs money, it sure ain't free,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.103
and I gots no job, no money at all,

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:47.475
but it's easy to steal all this from the mall.

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.312
Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.003
Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.994
and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,

00:00:55.994 --> 00:01:00.983
I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:03.867
When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.798
and I really must get some new gear soon

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.769
or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.674
But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:14.197
My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:17.050
School's almost over. Summer is near.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.543
And I'm sportin' torn Jordans.

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:24.843
I need something new. Only one thing left to do.

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:28.603
Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,

00:01:28.603 --> 00:01:30.986
check out my victims hangin' around.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.026
Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.212
Got to get some new gear. There's no other way.

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:37.570
I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.026
This is serious business. This ain't no fun.

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:42.594
And I can't have my posse laughin' at me.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:46.349
I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.934
Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:51.171
brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.633
'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:57.027
I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'

00:01:57.027 --> 00:01:59.795
They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.475
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.

00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.909
Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.629
Had my pistol and knew just what to do.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.816
Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:12.419
He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.165
and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:17.435
And the punk tried to run.

00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:20.197
Took off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'

00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:22.115
Fool fell between two parked cars.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.234
He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:29.019
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.132
While laying there dying, all he could say

00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:36.195
was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:38.924
You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.538
As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.436
Very next day, I bopped into school

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.842
with my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:51.330
I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.499
because now I needs a new jacket to wear."

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:04.308
Thank you. (Applause)

00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:09.239
For the last 15 years that I have been performing,

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.969
all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.425
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.025
It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.497
and while those things hold weight,

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:25.185
it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:29.073
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:

00:03:29.073 --> 00:03:32.001
How do I get people who hate poetry

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.889
to love me?

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.188
Because I'm an extension of my work,

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:39.092
and if they love me, then they will love my work,

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:42.359
and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.505
and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:48.612
which is to transcend it to the world.

00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:53.467
And in 1996, I found the answer in principles

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:58.118
in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,

00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:02.977
who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:07.022
And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,

00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:09.364
and I read him one of my pieces,

00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:11.610
and you know what he told me?

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.567
"Yo' wack.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:16.601
You know what the problem is with you, homie?

00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.041
You don't read other people's poetry,

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:22.171
and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures

00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:27.896
to tonal consideration." (Laughter)

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:31.093
Now he kept on rambling

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:35.898
about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.

00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:38.750
Now I could have quit. I should have quit.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.230
I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.615
I didn't know you actually have to have creative control.

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:49.598
So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.

00:04:49.598 --> 00:04:53.015
When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:56.395
I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.871
to ask him who's the best poet.

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.111
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea

00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:05.639
because he told me it was brain food.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.495
Then one day I told him,

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:15.831
"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter)

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:19.951
And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis

00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:22.879
on a poet named Etheridge Knight

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.296
and the oral nature of poetry,

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:26.835
and from that point,

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:29.323
Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,

00:05:29.323 --> 00:05:32.351
because what Etheridge Knight taught me

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.257
was that I could make my words sound like music,

00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:39.167
even my small ones, the monosyllables,

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.267
the ifs, ands, buts, whats,

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:45.789
the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.959
and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.191
I wanted to know which poet he read,

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:55.287
and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:59.927
a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:02.511
a poet could ever be:

00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.103
Broadway, baby.

00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:08.447
And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away

00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:12.283
and attack the poetry with my body.

00:06:12.283 --> 00:06:14.991
But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.

00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:19.365
The biggest lesson I learned was many years later

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:24.183
when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.634
who looked at me up and down

00:06:26.634 --> 00:06:29.631
and said I don't look like I have any experience

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.989
to be working in this business.

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.058
And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:39.168
you're a failed actor who became an agent,

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:40.732
and you know why you failed as an actor?

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.942
Because people like me took your job.

00:06:43.942 --> 00:06:46.710
I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.101
in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point

00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:54.137
who were in my way on my way to master the art of space,

00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:56.452
and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child

00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:58.630
you can fit in there only so I can push them

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.421
to the back of the wall with my experience.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.500
People have bought tickets to my experience

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.205
and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:08.385
that the revolution is near, so stock up.

00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:10.765
I'm so experienced that when you went

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.408
to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,

00:07:13.408 --> 00:07:15.973
I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.

00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:18.773
I can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:22.709
of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.702
that it was his father who gave it to my mother,

00:07:25.702 --> 00:07:27.554
and that's a double entendre.

00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:30.797
I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School

00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:33.168
and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child

00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:35.492
in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught

00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:39.168
teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans

00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:42.512
and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.

00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:45.566
Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.864
"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."

00:07:47.864 --> 00:07:50.528
Method acting is nothing but a mixture

00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:53.464
of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,

00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:56.552
like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.

00:07:56.552 --> 00:07:58.648
Dude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.

00:07:58.648 --> 00:08:00.115
I could make David Mamet

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.556
psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,

00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:06.155
Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee

00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:09.462
kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:12.451
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:15.195
Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon

00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:17.659
kung fu secret.

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.496
Boards don't hit back.

00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:21.734
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.097
in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,

00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:27.163
which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:30.059
Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:34.203
buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,

00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:36.618
so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack

00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:39.283
go-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,

00:08:39.283 --> 00:08:42.987
whatever slander you send my way,

00:08:42.987 --> 00:08:45.107
your mother.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:49.307
Thank you. (Applause)
