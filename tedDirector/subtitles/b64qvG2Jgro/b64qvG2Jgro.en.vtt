00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:19.970
I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.277
I do experiments to test how different chemicals

00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:25.877
in the brain influence the choices we make.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:32.625
I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.863
a cheese sandwich.

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:38.523
That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich

00:00:38.523 --> 00:00:42.145
is the solution to all your tough decisions.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:47.202
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.502
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:51.795
in how a brain chemical called serotonin

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.065
would influence people's decisions in social situations.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:58.160
Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.975
the way people react when they're treated unfairly.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:03.513
So we did an experiment.

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:06.659
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.282
this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:14.914
that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:16.092
in the brain.

00:01:16.092 --> 00:01:19.069
This is the amino acid tryptophan.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.430
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.882
people were more likely to take revenge

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:27.430
when they're treated unfairly.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.253
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:33.982
that came out afterwards.

00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:36.477
("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:38.572
("What a friend we have in cheeses")

00:01:38.572 --> 00:01:41.772
("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?

00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:47.167
("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.300
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.545
because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.874
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink

00:01:55.874 --> 00:01:59.076
that affected their tryptophan levels.

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:02.757
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:05.558
in cheese and chocolate.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.868
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:11.949
help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.916
So there you have it:

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:17.423
the evolution of a headline.

00:02:17.423 --> 00:02:19.765
When this happened, a part of me thought, well,

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.769
what's the big deal?

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.648
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:27.724
it's just a news story.

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:31.077
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.

00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:34.974
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:38.101
and it affects not just the stories you read in the news

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.880
but also the products you see on the shelves.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.547
When the headlines rolled, what happened was,

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.373
the marketers came calling.

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.592
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:52.853
of a mood-boosting bottled water?

00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:54.997
Or would I go on television to demonstrate,

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:56.022
in front of a live audience,

00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:59.621
that comfort foods really do make you feel better?

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.582
I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.956
I would have been going beyond the science,

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:09.213
and good scientists are careful not to do this.

00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:13.581
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:16.141
Here's one example: Neuro drinks,

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.382
a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:22.283
which according to its label helps reduce stress,

00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:25.709
enhances mood, provides focused concentration,

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.397
and promotes a positive outlook.

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:33.022
I have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:36.898
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.

00:03:36.898 --> 00:03:40.328
So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:43.877
curious about some of the research backing these claims.

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:46.803
So I went to the company's website looking to find

00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:50.229
some controlled trials of their products.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.906
But I didn't find any.

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:55.644
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:59.606
on their label right next to a picture of a brain.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:05.309
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.771
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.462
to read a scientific article.

00:04:10.462 --> 00:04:13.789
For half the people, the article included a brain image,

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.652
and for the other half, it was the same article

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.356
but it didn't have a brain image.

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:19.988
At the end — you see where this is going —

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.098
people were asked whether they agreed

00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:25.420
with the conclusions of the article.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.693
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions

00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:29.606
with no image.

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:33.253
And this is how much they agree with the same article

00:04:33.253 --> 00:04:36.020
that did include a brain image.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.969
So the take-home message here is,

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.876
do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.

00:04:42.876 --> 00:04:44.989
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:48.687
neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:51.140
and we're constantly discovering amazing things

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.413
about the brain.

00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:55.557
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT

00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:58.357
figured out how to break habits in rats

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:02.350
just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.940
Really cool stuff.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.233
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:12.469
high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.508
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot

00:05:15.508 --> 00:05:19.054
a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:21.850
for what's variously been called neuro-bunk,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.542
neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:31.880
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.792
to read people's thoughts and emotions.

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.839
Here's a study published by a team of researchers

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.672
as an op-ed in The New York Times.

00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:45.917
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:50.367
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:52.536
So how'd they figure this out?

00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:55.564
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.846
and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:02.308
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain

00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:04.960
called the insula, a region they say

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.744
is linked to feelings of love and compassion.

00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:12.404
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:16.691
this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:18.835
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:22.351
and that's that the insula does a lot.

00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:24.656
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions

00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:26.998
like love and compassion,

00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.671
but it's also involved in tons of other processes,

00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:32.744
like memory, language, attention,

00:06:32.744 --> 00:06:36.780
even anger, disgust and pain.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.243
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.696
you hate your iPhone.

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:46.540
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.566
you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:54.232
from off this list, and it's a really long list.

00:06:54.232 --> 00:06:56.566
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.688
have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third

00:06:59.688 --> 00:07:04.424
of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.938
So chances are really, really good

00:07:05.938 --> 00:07:09.064
that your insula is going off right now,

00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:10.686
but I won't kid myself

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:14.363
to think this means you love me.

00:07:14.363 --> 00:07:17.270
So speaking of love and the brain,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.135
there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,

00:07:21.135 --> 00:07:24.620
who claims that scientists have found the glue

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.267
that holds society together,

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:31.043
the source of love and prosperity.

00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:33.232
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:37.089
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.956
You've probably heard of it.

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:41.848
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing

00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:44.793
that when you boost people's oxytocin,

00:07:44.793 --> 00:07:48.966
this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:53.046
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:55.888
Now these studies are scientifically valid,

00:07:55.888 --> 00:08:00.024
and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.

00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:02.737
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin

00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:07.480
increases envy. It increases gloating.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.796
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:13.888
at the expense of other groups.

00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:18.140
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.960
So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.711
is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.

00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.071
(Laughter)

00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:34.181
So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.959
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.630
What about the clinic?

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.045
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:45.114
that uses a radioactive tracer

00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:48.154
to track blood flow in the brain.

00:08:48.154 --> 00:08:51.238
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,

00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:55.356
there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:58.809
one of these SPECT scans and use the image

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:01.446
to help diagnose your problems.

00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:03.975
These scans, the clinics say, can help

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:06.877
prevent Alzheimer's disease,

00:09:06.877 --> 00:09:09.341
solve weight and addiction issues,

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.013
overcome marital conflicts,

00:09:12.013 --> 00:09:15.163
and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses

00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:18.742
ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.

00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:21.312
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.

00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:23.478
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions

00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:26.782
of dollars a year in business.

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:28.866
There's just one problem.

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:31.543
The broad consensus in neuroscience

00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:34.728
is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness

00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:37.511
from a single brain scan.

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:39.742
But these clinics have treated

00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:42.182
tens of thousands of patients to date,

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:43.944
many of them children,

00:09:43.944 --> 00:09:47.422
and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,

00:09:47.422 --> 00:09:53.419
so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:56.533
I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,

00:09:56.533 --> 00:10:00.814
about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness

00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:05.538
and even maybe to make us better and smarter.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:08.238
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate

00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:12.542
help us make better decisions, count me in.

00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:15.118
But we're not there yet.

00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:18.853
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:22.551
we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love

00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:25.934
just by looking at their brain scans,

00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:30.198
and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.

00:10:30.198 --> 00:10:32.402
Maybe someday we will, but until then,

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:35.245
we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:38.631
detract resources and attention away from the real science

00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.390
that's playing a much longer game.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.828
So here's where you come in.

00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:47.999
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:50.878
don't just take them at their word.

00:10:50.878 --> 00:10:54.124
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.

00:10:54.124 --> 00:10:58.022
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.

00:10:58.022 --> 00:11:03.110
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.605
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:11.605
Thank you. (Applause)
