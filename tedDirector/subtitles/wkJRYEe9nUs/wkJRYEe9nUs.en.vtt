♫ Jill Sobule: At a conference in Monterey by the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
♫ I first saw you and I got so shy. ♫

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.330
♫ You see, I was a little paranoid 'cause I might have been high. ♫

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
♫ And I hadn't done that in ages and I won't do that again. ♫

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
♫ But that's another story. ♫

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.330
♫ Loved you forever and I've been a big fan, ♫

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
♫ the one-woman shows, I even rented "Pat." ♫

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
♫ I got enough nerve to come up to you, ♫

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.330
♫ but little did I know one year later we'd be doing this show. ♫

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.330
♫ I sing. Julia Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
♫ Sobule: Sometimes it works. Sweeney: Sometimes it doesn't. ♫

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.330
♫ Sweeney: At a conference in Monterey next to the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
♫ I first saw you and I wasn't so shy. ♫

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.330
and I wanted you to do the theme song.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.330
but I kept remaining a fan of yours.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
And then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
and I couldn't get off the couch, I listened to your song,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
♫ "Now That I Don't Have You," ♫ over and over and over and over again.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
And also, I can't believe that we're eating sushi

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.330
in front of the fish tank,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
which, personally, I think is really inappropriate.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
(Laughter)

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.330
(Applause)

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And little did I know that one year later ... ♫ we'd be doing this show. ♫

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.330
♫ Sobule: I sing. Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Sobule: Hey, they asked us back! Sweeney: Can you stand it?!

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.330
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.330
♫ Sobule: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.330
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.330
♫ Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.330
♫ Statue in the park has lost his crown. ♫

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
♫ William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Mmm.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
♫ Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.330
♫ And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
♫ Founding fathers all had slaves. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
♫ The explorers slaughtered the braves. ♫ Sweeney: Horribly.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
♫ Sobule: The Old Testament God can be so petty. ♫

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Sweeney: Don't get me started on that. (Laughter)

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
♫ Sobule: Paul McCartney, jealous of John, even more so now that he's gone. ♫

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.330
♫ Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie. ♫

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
♫ Pablo Picasso, cruel to his wives. ♫ Sweeney: Horrible.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
♫ Sobule: My favorite poets took their own lives. ♫

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.330
♫ Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five, below before our eyes. ♫

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
♫ And he sold bad wine. ♫

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.330
♫ Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah ♫

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.330
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
♫ Sobule: Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice. ♫ Sweeney: Oh.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
♫ Lewis Carroll I'm sure did Alice. ♫ Sweeney: What?!

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.330
♫ Plato in the cave with those very young boys. ♫ Sweeney: Ooh...

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
♫ Sobule: Hillary supported the war. ♫

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
♫ Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. ♫ (Laughter)

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
♫ Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. ♫ (Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
♫ Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, ♫

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
♫ Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
♫ Sobule: Take it, Julia. ♫

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
Sweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
visiting my mother. And to my mother,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
I like her weight issues,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
I like how she's transformed talk television,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
I like how she's brought reading back to America --

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
but there was something that happened the last two weeks

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.330
it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And that was that she did two entire shows

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
promoting that movie "The Secret."

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.330
It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.330
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And the basic idea is

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
that there's this law of attraction, and

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
your thoughts have this vibrating energy

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.330
that goes out into the universe

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
and then you attract good things to happen to you.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.330
On a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" --

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.330
would go on Oprah

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.330
and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
So that's what I have to say.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
(Laughter)

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.330
(Applause)

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.330
♫ Sobule: I sing. Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.330
♫ Sobule: Sometimes it works. Sweeney: Sometimes it doesn't. ♫

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:10.330
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.330
