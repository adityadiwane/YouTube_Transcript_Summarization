00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.447
I love to collect things.

00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:20.437
Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.166
of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.404
from all around the world to insects

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:28.808
that I've captured and put in jars.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:30.845
Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:32.781
that I love the Natural History Museum

00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:34.181
and the collections of animals

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.996
at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:38.133
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.550
that you can go and look at,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.285
and they memorialize a specific point of time

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:42.932
in this animal's life.

00:00:42.932 --> 00:00:44.814
So I was thinking about my own life,

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:46.727
and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,

00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:49.510
for the ages, and also — (Laughter) —

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.997
the lives of my friends, but

00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:54.613
the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:57.789
on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.492
So instead, I turned to video,

00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:02.790
and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.564
someone and to capture a specific moment in time.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.741
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.141
and then, using video mapping and video projection,

00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.622
I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:16.564
projected into jars. (Laughter)

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:18.278
So now I have this collection of my friends

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.067
I can take around with me whenever I go,

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:21.979
and this is called Animalia Chordata,

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.796
from the Latin nomenclature for

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:25.956
human being, classification system.

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:28.918
So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:33.277
and they actually move around. (Laughter)

00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:35.370
So, this is interesting to me,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.260
but it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.082
It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add

00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:42.694
an interaction system. So what I did was,

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:44.477
I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:46.636
to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.363
You know, just like people on the street

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:50.219
when you get too close to them.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.805
Some people reacted in terror. (Laughter)

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:54.818
Others reacted in asking you for help,

00:01:54.818 --> 00:01:58.316
and some people hide from you.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:01:59.947
So this was really interesting to me, this idea of

00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:02.082
taking video off the screen and putting it in real life,

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:04.329
and also adding interactivity to sculpture.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.394
So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.226
and trapped them in jars as well

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.171
and created a piece known as Garden,

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:14.523
which is literally a garden of humanity.

00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:16.667
But something about the first piece,

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:18.572
the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.393
this idea of interaction with art,

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.715
and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:25.004
and also being challenged by interacting with art.

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:26.859
So I wanted to create a new piece that actually

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.748
forced people to come and interact with something,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.447
and the way I did this was actually by projecting

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:34.827
a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.322
This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is

00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:39.185
it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.526
You may never experience the entire thing yourself.

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:43.850
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.275
stands there in the blender and looks at you,

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:48.349
or you can actually choose to interact with it.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.482
So if you do choose to interact with the piece,

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:54.642
and you press the blender button, it actually sends

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:58.074
this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:01.626
By doing that, you are now part of my piece.

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.658
You, like the people that are trapped in my work

00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:07.719
— (Blender noises, laughter) —

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:14.826
have become part of my work as well. (Laughter)

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:17.019
(Laughter)

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.442
(Applause)

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:23.082
But, but this seems a bit unfair, right?

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:25.594
I put my friends in jars, I put this character,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.411
this sort of endangered species character in a blender.

00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:30.411
But I'd never done anything about myself.

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.123
I'd never really memorialized myself.

00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:34.393
So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:36.618
This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece

00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:38.865
called A Point Just Passed,

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:41.497
in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:43.201
and it's up to you.

00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:45.147
If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:46.854
you actually age me.

00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:49.410
So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.072
you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:57.303
and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.823
From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.911
From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:06.770
and then, from there, into an elderly man.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.702
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:12.773
in one day, the piece goes black

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.466
and is not to be reset until the next day.

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:17.550
So, in doing so, you're erasing time.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.478
You're actually implicit in this work

00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:21.484
and you're erasing my life.

00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:23.630
So I like this about interactive video sculpture,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.207
that you can actually interact with it,

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:27.079
that all of you can actually touch an artwork

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.943
and be part of the artwork yourselves,

00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:31.414
and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you

00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:33.574
trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:38.665
Thank you. (Applause)
