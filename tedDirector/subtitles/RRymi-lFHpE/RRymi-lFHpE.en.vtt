00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.191
I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like
to talk a little bit about today

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.936
are some ideas that I think
have just tremendous resonance

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.456
with all the things that have been
talked about the last two days.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.256
So many different points of resonance

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.757
that it's going to be difficult
to bring them all up,

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:41.096
but I'll try to do my best.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.496
Does anybody remember these?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.296
(Laughter)

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.296
OK, so these are LP records
and they've been replaced, right?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.016
They've been swept away
over the last two decades

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.896
by these types of world-flattening
digitization technologies, right?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.536
And I think it was best witnessed

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.376
when Thomas was playing the music
as we came in the room today.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.056
What's happened in the music world
is there's a culture,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.856
or an ecosystem that's been created

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.456
that, if you take some words from Apple,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.456
the catchphrase --
that we create, rip, mix and burn.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.656
What I mean by that is that anyone
in the world is free and allowed

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.016
to create new music and musical ideas.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.736
Anyone in the world is allowed
to rip or copy musical ideas,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.496
use them in innovative ways.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.495
Anyone is allowed to mix them
in different types of ways,

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.696
draw connections between musical ideas,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.696
and people can burn them or create
final products and continue the circle.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.056
And what that's done
is it's created, like I said,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080
a vibrant community that's very inclusive,

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:43.816
with people continually working
to connect musical ideas,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.256
innovate them and keep things
constantly up to date.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.056
Today's hit single
is not last year's hit single.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.256
But I'm not here
to talk about music today.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.736
I'm here to talk about books.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.176
In particular, textbooks
and the kind of educational materials

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.616
that we use every day in school.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.355
Has anyone here ever been to school?

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:03.776
(Laughter)

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.776
OK, does anybody realize
there's a crisis in our schools,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.576
around the world?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.136
I'm not going to spend
too much time on that,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.496
but what I want to talk about
is some of the disconnects

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.016
that appear when an author
publishes a book.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.898
That in fact, the publishing process --

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:22.113
just because of the fact
that it's complicated,

00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:23.816
it's heavy, books are expensive --

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.136
creates a sort of a wall
between authors of books

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.696
and the ultimate users of books,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.816
be they teachers, students
or just general readers.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.976
And this is even more true
if you happen to speak a language

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.936
other than one of the world's
major languages, and especially English.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.776
I'm going to call these people
below the barrier "shutouts"

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.943
because they're really
shut out of the process

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.495
of being able to share
their knowledge with the world.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.711
And so what I want to talk about today
is trying to take these ideas

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:52.558
that we've seen in the musical culture

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:54.923
and try to bring these
towards reinventing the way

00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:58.776
we think about writing books,
using them and teaching from them.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.616
So, that's what I'd like to talk about

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.879
and, really, how we get
from where we are now

00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:04.176
to where we need to go.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.296
The first thing I'd like you to do
is a little thought experiment.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.082
Imagine taking all the world's books.

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:12.616
OK, everybody imagine books
and imagine just tearing out the pages.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.736
So, liberating these pages

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.016
and imagine digitizing them
and then storing them

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.936
in a vast, interconnected,
global repository.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.576
Think of it as a massive iTunes
for book-type content.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.856
And then take that material
and imagine making it all open,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.936
so that people can modify it,
play with it, improve it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.216
Imagine making it free,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.479
so that anyone in the world can have
access to all of this knowledge,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:39.856
and imagine using information technology

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.216
so that you can update this content,
improve it, play with it,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.896
on a timescale that's more
on the order of seconds instead of years.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.776
Instead of editions of a book
coming out every two years,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.736
imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.016
So, imagine we could do that
and imagine we could put people into this.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.416
So that we could truly build
an ecosystem with not just authors,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.016
but all the people
who could be or want to be authors

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.096
in all the different
languages of the world,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.696
and I think if you could do this,
it would be called --

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.296
I'm just going to refer to it
as a knowledge ecosystem.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.416
So, really, this is the dream,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.298
and in a sense what you can think of it

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.465
is we're trying
to enable anyone in the world,

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.016
I mean anyone in the world --

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.256
(Laughter)

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.376
to be their own educational DJ,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.216
creating educational materials,
sharing them with the world,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.976
constantly innovating on them.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.216
So, this is the dream.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.056
In fact, this dream
is actually being realized.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.896
Over the last six-and-a-half years,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.576
we've been working really hard
at Rice University

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.176
on a project called Connexions,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.616
and so what I'd like to do
for the rest of the talk

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.021
is just tell you a little bit

00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:44.096
about what people are doing
with Connexions,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.456
which you can kind of
think of as the counterpoint

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.385
to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.838
where they're working on the hardware
of bringing education to the world.

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:54.336
We're working on the open-source tools

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.896
and the content.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.736
So, that's sort of
to put it in perspective here.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.336
So, create.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.336
What are some of the people
that are using these kind of tools?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.576
Well, the first thing is,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.456
there's a community
of engineering professors,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.576
from Cambridge to Kyoto,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.536
who are developing engineering content
in electrical engineering

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.536
to develop what you can think of
as a massive, super textbook

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.496
that covers the entire area
of electrical engineering.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.736
And not only that --

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.040
it can be customized for use in each
of their own individual institutions.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.576
If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.976
a private music teacher and mom
from Champagne, Illinois,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.376
who wanted to share her fantastic
music content with the world,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.656
on how to teach kids how to play music --

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.136
Her material is now used
over 600,000 times per month.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.656
Tremendous use.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.936
In fact, a lot of this use coming
from United States K-12 schools,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.376
because anyone who's involved
in a school scale back,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.056
the first thing that's cut
is the music curriculum.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.576
And so this is just indicating
the tremendous thirst

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.736
for this kind of open, free content.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.136
A lot of teachers are using this stuff.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.216
What about ripping?
What about copying, reusing?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.656
A team of volunteers
at the University of Texas at El Paso --

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.536
graduate students translating
this engineering super textbook ideas.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.176
And within about a week,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.536
having this be some
of our most popular material

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.936
in widespread use all over Latin America,
and in particular in Mexico,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.776
because of the open,
extensible nature of this.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.616
People, volunteers and even companies

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.256
that are translating materials
into Asian languages

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.456
like Chinese, Japanese and Thai,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.880
to spread the knowledge even further.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.536
OK, what about people who are mixing?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.736
What does "mixing" mean?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.776
"Mixing" means
building customized courses,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.296
means building customized books.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.056
Companies like National Instruments,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.176
who are embedding very powerful,
interactive simulations

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.376
into the materials,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.336
so that we can go way beyond
our regular kind of textbook

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.576
to an experience

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.536
that all the teaching materials
are things you can actually interact with

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.496
and play around with
and actually learn as you do.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.856
We've been working
with Teachers Without Borders,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.119
who are very interested
in mixing our materials.

00:07:14.143 --> 00:07:16.816
They're going to be using
Connexions as their platform

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.056
to develop and deliver teaching materials
for teaching teachers how to teach

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.656
in 84 countries around the world.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.896
TWB is currently in Iraq,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.456
training 20,000 teachers
supported by USAID.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.296
And to them, this idea
of being able to remix

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.976
and customize to the local context
is extraordinarily important,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.736
because just providing
free content to people

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.776
has actually been likened
by people in the developing world

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.136
to a kind of cultural imperialism --

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.696
that if you don't empower people

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.096
with the ability
to re-contextualize the material,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.296
translate it into their own language
and take ownership of it,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.056
it's not good.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.456
OK, other organizations
we've been working with, UC Merced --

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.256
people know about UC Merced.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.176
It's a new university in California,
in the Central Valley,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.936
working very closely
with community colleges.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.296
They're actually developing

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.616
a lot of their science
and engineering curriculum

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.136
to spread widely
around the world in our system.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.065
And they're also trying to develop
all of their software tools

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:22.496
completely open-source.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.256
We've been working with AMD,
which has a project called 50x15,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.016
which is trying to bring
Internet connectivity

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.656
to 50 percent of the world's
population by 2015.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.696
We're going to be
providing content to them

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.856
in a whole range of different languages.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.976
And we've also been working
with a number of other organizations.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.016
In particular, a bunch of the projects
that are funded by Hewlett Foundation,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.496
who have taken a real leadership role
in this area of open content.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.096
OK, burn -- I think
this is, sort of, quite interesting.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.376
"Burn" is the idea of trying
to create the physical instantiation

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.616
of one of these courses.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.696
And I think a lot of you received --

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.576
I think all of you received one
of these music books in your gift pack.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.056
A little present for you.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.576
Just to tell you quickly about it:
this is an engineering textbook.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.240
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.520
This costs -- anybody guess?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.376
How much would it cost in a bookstore?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.616
(Audience) 65 dollars.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.376
Richard Baraniuk:
OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.736
Why does it cost 22 dollars?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.736
Because it's published on demand

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.296
and it's developed
from this repository of open materials.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.016
If this book were to be published
by a regular publisher,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.216
it would cost at least 122 dollars.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.456
So what we're seeing

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.376
is moving this burning
or publication process

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.896
from the regular,
sort of single-authored book

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.296
towards community-authored materials

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.056
that are modular, that are customized
to each individual class

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.736
and published on demand
very inexpensively,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.256
either pushed out through Amazon

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.456
or published directly
through an on-demand press, like QOOP.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.896
And I think that this is
an extraordinarily interesting area

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.736
because there is tremendous area
under this long tail in publishing.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.896
We're not talking
about the Harry Potter end,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.136
right at the left side.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.376
We're talking about books

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.016
on hypergeometric
partial differential equations.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.336
Books that might sell
100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.216
There is tremendous
sustaining revenue under this long tail

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.656
to sustain open projects like ours,

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.536
but also to sustain this new emergence
of on-demand publishers,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.856
like QOOP, who produced these two books.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.166
And I think one of the things
that you should take away from this talk

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.216
is that there's an impending
cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.896
that's going to be happening
in the publishing industry.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.776
And it's going to reach a crescendo
over the next few years,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.616
and I think that it's for our benefit,
really, and for the world's benefit.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.296
OK, so what are the enablers?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.256
What's really making all of this happen?

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.896
There's tons of technology,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.776
and the only piece of technology
that I really want to talk about is XML.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.536
How many people know about XML?

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.776
Oh, great.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.576
So it's the future of the web, right?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.976
It's semantic representation of content.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.376
And what you can really
think of XML in this case

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.296
is it's the packaging
that we're putting around these pages.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.576
Remember we took the book,
tore the pages out?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.496
Well, what the XML is going to do

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.856
is it's going to turn those pages
into Lego blocks.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.776
XML are the nubs on the Lego

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.856
that allow us to combine the content
together in a myriad different ways,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.376
and it provides us a framework
to share content.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.696
So, it lets you take this ecosystem

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.296
in its primordial state
of all this content,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.178
all the pages you've torn out of books,

00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:50.176
and create highly sophisticated
learning machines:

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.936
books, courses, course packs.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.656
It gives you the ability
to personalize the learning experience

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.376
to each individual student,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.056
so that every student
can have a book or a course

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.536
that's customized to their
learning style, their context,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.296
their language and the things
that excite them.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.936
It lets you reuse the same materials
in multiple different ways,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.936
and surprising new ways.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.896
It lets you interconnect ideas,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.096
indicating how fields
relate to each other.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.376
And I'll just give you my personal story.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.896
We came up with this
six-and-a-half years ago

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.536
because I teach the stuff in the red box.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.336
And my day job, as Chris said --
I'm an electrical engineering professor.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.016
I teach signal processing

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.576
and my challenge
was to show that this math --

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.936
Wow, about half of you
have already fallen asleep

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.416
just looking at the equation.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.616
(Laughter)

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.096
But this seemingly dry math

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.456
is actually the center
of this tremendously powerful web

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.176
that links technology --

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.936
that links really cool applications
like music synthesizers

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.096
to tremendous economic opportunities,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.256
but also governed
by intellectual property.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.696
And the thing that I realized

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.976
is there was no way
that I, as an engineer,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.620
could write this book
that would get all of this across.

00:13:02.644 --> 00:13:04.073
We needed a community to do it

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:08.136
and we needed new tools
to be able to interconnect these ideas.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.016
And I think that really,
in a sense, what we're trying to do

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.016
is make Minsky's dream come to a reality,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.296
where you can imagine
all the books in a library

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.256
actually starting to talk to each other.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.976
And people who are teachers out here --
whoever taught, you know this --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.496
it's the interconnections between ideas
that teaching is really all about.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.576
OK, back to math.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.096
Imagine -- this is possible:

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.696
that every single equation that you
click on in one of your new e-texts

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.456
is something that you're going to be able
to explore and experiment with.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.016
So imagine your kid's
algebra textbook in seventh grade.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.936
You can click on every single equation

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.816
and bring up a little tool
to be able to experiment with it,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.696
tinker with it, understand it.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.456
Because we really
don't understand until we do.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.656
The same type of mark-up,
like MathML, for chemistry.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.976
Imagine chemistry textbooks

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.216
that actually understand the structure
of how molecules are formed.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.176
Imagine Music XML

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.616
that actually lets you delve
into the semantic structure of music,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.456
play with it, understand it.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.656
It's no wonder that everybody's
getting into it, right?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.936
Even the three wise men.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.136
(Laughter)

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.696
OK, the second big enabler,
and this is where I told a big lie.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.856
The second big enabler
is intellectual property.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.376
Because, in fact, I got up here

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.736
and I talked about how great
the music culture is.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.376
We can share and rip, mix and burn,
but in fact, that's all illegal.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.776
And we would be accused
of [piracy] for doing that,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.136
because this music has been propertized.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.456
It's now owned,
much of it by big industries.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.242
So, really, the key thing here
is we can't let this happen.

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:46.976
We can't let this
Napster thing happen here.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.953
So, what we have to do
is get it right from the very beginning.

00:14:49.977 --> 00:14:53.376
And what we have to do
is find an intellectual property framework

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.456
that makes sharing safe
and makes it easily understandable.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.296
And the inspiration here
is taken from open-source software.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.896
Things like Linux and the GPL.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.301
The Creative Commons licenses.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.516
How many people
have heard of creative commons?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.496
If you have not, you must learn about it.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.096
Creativecommons.org.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.456
At the bottom of every piece
of material in Connexions

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.336
and in lots of other projects,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.936
you can find their logo.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.536
Clicking on that logo
takes you to an absolute no-nonsense,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.696
human-readable document, a deed,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.387
that tells you exactly
what you can do with this content.

00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:34.016
In fact, you're free to share it,
to do all of these things:

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.096
to copy it, to change it,
even to make commercial use of it,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.016
as long as you attribute the author.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.456
Because in academic publishing
and much of educational publishing,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.816
it's really this idea of sharing knowledge

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.136
and making impact.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.016
That's why people write,
not necessarily making bucks.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.136
We're not talking
about Harry Potter, right?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.856
We're at the long tail end here.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.536
Behind that is the legal code,
very carefully constructed.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.416
And Creative Commons is taking off --

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.576
over 43 million things out there,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.696
licensed with a Creative Commons license.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.816
Not just text,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.336
but music, images, video.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.376
And there's actually a tremendous uptake

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.856
of the number of people
that are actually licensing music

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.096
to make it free for people
who do this whole idea of re-sampling,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.256
ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.976
OK, I'd like to conclude
with just the last few points.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.376
So, we've built this idea of a commons.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.296
People are using it.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.616
We get over 500,000 unique visitors
per month, just to our particular site.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.696
MIT OpenCourseWare,
which is another large open-content site,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.936
gets a similar number of hits.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.616
But how do we protect this?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.416
How do we protect it into the future?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.176
And the first thing
that people are probably thinking

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.816
is quality control, right?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.536
Because we're saying that anybody
can contribute things to this commons.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.376
Anybody can contribute anything.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.936
So that could be a problem.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.176
It didn't take long until people
started contributing materials,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.336
for example, on lingerie,

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.336
which is actually a pretty good module.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.936
The only problem is it's plagiarized
from a major French feminist journal,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.776
and when you go
to the supposed course website,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.976
it points to a lingerie-selling website.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.176
So this is a little bit of a problem.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.256
So we clearly need some kind
of idea of quality control

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.976
and this is really where the idea
of review and peer review comes in.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.905
You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.815
Because Chris and his team have ensured

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:44.016
that things are
very, very high quality, right?

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.456
And so we need to be able
to do the same thing.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.536
And we need to be able
to design structures,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.616
and what we're doing
is designing social software

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.736
to enable anyone to build
their own peer review process,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.576
and we call these things "lenses."

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.016
And basically what they allow

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.456
is anyone out there can develop
their own peer-review process,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.456
so that they can focus
on the content in the repository

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.195
that they think is really important.

00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:11.496
And you can think of TED
as a potential lens.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.297
So I'd just like to end by saying:

00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.976
you can really view this
as a call to action.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.976
Connexions and open content
is all about sharing knowledge.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.016
All of you here are tremendously imbued
with tremendous amounts of knowledge,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.816
and what I'd like to do
is invite each and every one of you

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.056
to contribute to this project
and other projects of its type,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.856
because I think together
we can truly change the landscape

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.096
of education and educational publishing.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.320
So, thanks very much.
