00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I just did something I've never done before.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Now I'm not a scientist,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
from the University of South Florida

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
This is the boat we were on, by the way.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
The scientists I was with

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the birds, the turtles,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
They're looking at the really little stuff

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And what they're finding

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
which is very bad news,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
because so much life depends on it.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So contrary to what we heard a few months back

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
about how 75 percent of that oil

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
sort of magically disappeared

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and we didn't have to worry about it,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
this disaster is still unfolding.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
It's still working its way up the food chain.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Rachel Carson --

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
the godmother of modern environmentalism --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
warned us about this very thing

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
back in 1962.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
She pointed out that the "control men" --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
as she called them --

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
who carpet-bombed towns and fields

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
with toxic insecticides like DDT,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
not the birds.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
But they forgot this:

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
the fact that birds dine on grubs,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
that robins eat lots of worms

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
now saturated with DDT.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
songbirds died en masse,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
towns fell silent.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Thus the title "Silent Spring."

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I've been trying to pinpoint

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
because I'm Canadian,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and I can draw no ancestral ties.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And I think what it is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
is I don't think we have fully come to terms

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
with the meaning of this disaster,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
with what it meant to witness a hole

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
ripped in our world,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
gush forth on live TV,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
24 hours a day,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
for months.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
After telling ourselves for so long

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that our tools and technology can control nature,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
suddenly we were face-to-face

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
with our weakness,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
with our lack of control,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
as the oil burst out

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
of every attempt to contain it --

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
"top hats," "top kills"

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the bright idea

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
of firing old tires and golf balls

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
down that hole in the world.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
But even more striking

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
than the ferocious power emanating from that well

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
was the recklessness

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
with which that power was unleashed --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
the carelessness, the lack of planning

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that characterized the operation

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
from drilling to clean-up.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
If there is one thing

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
BP's watery improv act made clear,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
it is that, as a culture,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
we have become far too willing to gamble

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
with things that are precious

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and irreplaceable,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and to do so without a back-up plan,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
without an exit strategy.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And BP was hardly

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
our first experience of this in recent years.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Our leaders barrel into wars,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
telling themselves happy stories

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
about cakewalks and welcome parades.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Then, it is years of deadly damage control,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Frankensteins of sieges and surges

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and counter-insurgencies,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and once again, no exit strategy.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to similar overconfidence,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
convincing themselves that the latest bubble

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
is a new kind of market --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
the kind that never goes down.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And when it inevitably does,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
the best and the brightest

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
in this case, throwing massive amounts

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
of much-needed public money

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
down a very different kind of hole.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
As with BP, the hole does get plugged,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
at least temporarily,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
but not before

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
exacting a tremendous price.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
We have to figure out

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
why we keep letting this happen,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
because we are in the midst

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
deciding what to do, or not to do,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
about climate change.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Now as you know,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
a great deal of time is spent,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
in this country and around the world,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
inside the climate debate,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
are all wrong?"

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now a far more relevant question --

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
is, "What if those scientists are right?"

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Given the stakes, the climate crisis

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
clearly calls for us to act

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
based on the precautionary principle --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the theory that holds

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
that when human health and the environment

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
are significantly at risk

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and when the potential damage is irreversible,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
we cannot afford to wait

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
for perfect scientific certainty.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Better to err on the side of caution.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
More overt, the burden of proving

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that a practice is safe

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
but rather on the industry that stands to profit.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
But climate policy in the wealthy world --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
to the extent that such a thing exists --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is not based on precaution,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
but rather on cost-benefit analysis --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
finding the course of action that economists believe

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
will have the least impact

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
on our GDP.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
what can we do as quickly as possible

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to avoid potential catastrophe,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
we ask bizarre questions like this:

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
"What is the latest possible moment we can wait

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Can we put this off till 2020,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
2030, 2050?"

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Or we ask,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
"How much hotter can we let the planet get

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and still survive?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
where we're currently going --

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
four degrees Celsius?"

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And by the way,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
the assumption that we can safely control

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
the Earth's awesomely complex climate system

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
as if it had a thermostat,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
making the planet not too hot, not too cold,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
this is pure fantasy,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and it's not coming from the climate scientists.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It's coming from the economists

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
imposing their mechanistic thinking

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
on the science.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
The fact is that we simply don't know

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
when the warming that we create

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
will be utterly overwhelmed

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
by feedback loops.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So once again,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
why do we take these crazy risks

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
with the precious?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
A range of explanations

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
may be popping into your mind by now,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
like "greed."

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
because taking big risks, as we all know,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
pays a lot of money.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is hubris.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And greed and hubris

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
are intimately intertwined

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
when it comes to recklessness.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
taking home 100 times more

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
than a brain surgeon,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
then you need a narrative,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
you need a story

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
that makes that disparity okay.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And you actually don't have a lot of options.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
You're either an incredibly good scammer,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
or you're some kind of boy genius,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
the likes of which the world has never seen.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
are going to make you vastly overconfident

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and therefore more prone

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
to taking even bigger risks in the future.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
had a plaque on his desk

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
inscribed with this inspirational slogan:

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
"What would you attempt to do

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
if you knew you could not fail?"

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Now this is actually a popular plaque,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and this is a crowd of overachievers,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Don't feel ashamed.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Putting fear of failure out of your mind

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
can be a very good thing

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
if you're training for a triathlon

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
or preparing to give a TEDTalk,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
but personally, I think people with the power

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
would do better having

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
because -- maybe not that one in particular --

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
all of the time.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
So we have greed,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
we've got overconfidence/hubris,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
but since we're here at TEDWomen,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
let's consider one other factor

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that could be contributing in some small way

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
to societal recklessness.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
but studies do show that, as investors,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
women are much less prone

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
to taking reckless risks than men,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
precisely because, as we've already heard,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
women tend not to suffer from overconfidence

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
in the same way that men do.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So it turns out

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
that being paid less and praised less

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
has its upsides --

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
for society at least.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
The flipside of this

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
is that constantly being told

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that you are gifted, chosen

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and born to rule

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
has distinct societal downsides.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
brings us closer, I think,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
to the root of our collective recklessness.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Because none of us -- at least in the global North --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
neither men nor women,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
are fully exempt from this message.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Here's what I'm talking about.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Whether we actively believe them

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
or consciously reject them,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
our culture remains in the grips

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
of certain archetypal stories

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
about our supremacy

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
over others and over nature --

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and the conquering pioneer,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
the narrative of manifest destiny,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And just when you think these stories are fading into history,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and that we've gotten over them,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
they pop up in the strangest places.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
outside the women's washroom

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
in the Kansas City airport.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and yes, it really does say,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
"Slap Mother Nature in the face."

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that's just a bonus.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
I'm showing it because --

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
they're not a sponsor, are they? --

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
because, in its own way,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
this is a crass version

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
of our founding story.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
We slapped Mother Nature around and won,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and we always win,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
because dominating nature is our destiny.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
There's another one, equally important,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
about how that very same Mother Nature

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
is so nurturing and so resilient

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that we can never make a dent in her abundance.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
is tiny in relation to the total water volume."

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
In other words, the ocean is big;

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
she can take it.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that makes it possible

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
to take the reckless risks that we do.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Because this is our real master-narrative:

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
however much we mess up,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
there will always be more --

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
more water, more land,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
more untapped resources.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
A new bubble will replace the old one.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
A new technology will come along

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
to fix the messes we made with the last one.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
In a way, that is the story

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
of the settling of the Americas,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
the supposedly inexhaustible frontier

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
to which Europeans escaped.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
because it was the wealth from this land

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
that gave birth to our economic system,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
one that cannot survive without perpetual growth

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and an unending supply

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
of new frontiers.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Now the problem is

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
that the story was always a lie.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
The Earth always did have limits.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
They were just beyond our sights.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And now we are hitting those limits

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
on multiple fronts.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
I believe that we know this,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Not only do we continue to tell and retell

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
the same tired stories,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
but we are now doing so

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
with a frenzy and a fury

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
that, frankly, verges on camp.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
How else to explain the cultural space

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
occupied by Sarah Palin?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Now on the one hand,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
because God put those resources into the ground

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
in order for us to exploit them,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and on the other, glorying in the wilderness

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
of Alaska's untouched beauty

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
on her hit reality TV show.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Ignore those creeping fears

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
that we have finally hit the wall.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
There are still no limits.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
There will always be another frontier.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
So stop worrying and keep shopping.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Now, would that this were just about

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
In environmental circles,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
we are continuing with business as usual.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
This assessment, unfortunately,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
is far too optimistic.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
The truth is that we have already exhausted

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
that we have already entered

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
a far riskier business era,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
the era of extreme energy.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
including the icy Arctic seas,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
where a clean-up may simply be impossible.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and massive strip-mining operations for coal,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
the likes of which we haven't yet seen.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
I'm always surprised by how little

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
people outside of Canada

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
know about the Alberta Tar Sands,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
which this year are projected to become

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
the number one source of imported oil

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
to the United States.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
because I believe it speaks to recklessness

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and the path we're on

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
like little else.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So this is where the tar sands live,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
under one of the last magnificent

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
Boreal forests.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
The oil is not liquid.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Tar sand's oil is solid,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
mixed in with the soil.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
So to get at it,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
you first have to get rid of the trees.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Then, you rip off the topsoil

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and get at that oily sand.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
The process requires a huge amount of water,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.260
which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
That's very bad news for local indigenous people

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
living downstream

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Now looking at these images,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
which can already be seen from space

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and could grow to an area the size of England.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
I find it helps actually

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
the largest ever built.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
That's a person down there by the wheel.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
My point is that

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
this is not oil drilling.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
It's not even mining.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
It is terrestrial skinning.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Vast, vivid landscapes

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
are being gutted,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
left monochromatic gray.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
this would be an abomination

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
if it emitted not one particle of carbon.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
But the truth is that, on average,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
turning that gunk into crude oil

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
than it does to produce conventional oil

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
in Canada.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
How else to describe this,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
but as a form of mass insanity?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Just when we know we need to be learning

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
to live on the surface of our planet,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
off the power of sun, wind and waves,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
we are frantically digging

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
to get at the dirtiest,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
highest-emitting stuff imaginable.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
This is where our story of endless growth

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
has taken us,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
to this black hole at the center of my country --

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
a place of such planetary pain

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
that, like the BP gusher,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.260
one can only stand to look at it for so long.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
this is how civilizations commit suicide,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
by slamming their foot on the accelerator

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
at the exact moment

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
when they should be putting on the brakes.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
The problem is that our master-narrative

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
has an answer for that too.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
just like in every Hollywood movie,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
just like in the Rapture.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Now, you may have noticed

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
more and more headlines like these.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
is that, as the planet heats up,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
into the stratosphere

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
to reflect some of the sun's rays

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
back to space,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
thereby cooling the planet.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
would put what is essentially a garden hose

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
suspended by balloons,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
to spew sulfur dioxide.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
The serious scientists involved in this research

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
all stress that these techniques

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
are entirely untested.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
They don't know if they'll work,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
and they have no idea

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
is being greeted in some circles,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
particularly media circles,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
with a relief tinged with euphoria.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
An escape hatch has been reached.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
A new frontier has been found.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
Most importantly,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
You see, for some people,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
We badly need some new stories.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
willing to take different kinds of risks --

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
risks that confront recklessness head on,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
that put the precautionary principle into practice,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
even if that means through direct action --

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
blocking dirty power plants

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
We need stories

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
that replace that linear narrative of endless growth

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
with circular narratives

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
that remind us

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
that what goes around comes around.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
That this is our only home.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
There is no escape hatch.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
Call it karma, call it physics,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
action and reaction, call it precaution --

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
the principle that reminds us

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
that life is too precious to be risked

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
for any profit.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
Thank you.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:43.260
(Applause)
