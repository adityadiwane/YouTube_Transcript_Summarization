00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:18.916
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.963
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:26.164
So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:28.663
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:33.042
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:38.358
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:43.155
If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.133
Audience: What are you reading?

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.591
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.128
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:54.978
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:58.806
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.342
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:05.239
Right? The brain takes meaningless information

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.198
and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:10.454
what's there, we never see information,

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.729
we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.465
All right? Which means, when it comes to perception,

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:23.260
we're all like this frog.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.172
(Laughter)

00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:27.567
Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:32.035
that's useful. (Laughter)

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:39.067
(Laughter)

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:45.049
(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.761
BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.020
we get a little bit annoyed, right?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.750
But we're talking about perception here, right?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.115
And perception underpins everything we think, we know,

00:01:57.115 --> 00:01:59.986
we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.729
falling in love, everything begins with perception.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.674
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:10.133
we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.209
But actually, it's a tremendous problem,

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.826
because how can we ever see differently?

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:20.889
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.877
and all new perceptions begin in the same way.

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:27.459
They begin with a question.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.697
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:33.426
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:37.027
a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.

00:02:37.027 --> 00:02:38.387
Okay? (Laughter)

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.547
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:43.799
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.975
are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.291
it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:52.946
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:56.875
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.867
because it takes you into uncertainty.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.746
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:06.282
do anything new is to step into that space.

00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:09.506
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:13.090
evolution has given us an answer, right?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.685
And it enables us to address even the most difficult

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:21.364
of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:25.320
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.309
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.617
or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:33.618
is really stepping into that space.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:38.428
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?

00:03:38.428 --> 00:03:40.201
It's play.

00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:44.394
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:47.009
that actually it's a way of being.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.900
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.226
is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.

00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:58.501
Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:02.610
and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.336
and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:08.942
is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:12.833
Now if you look at these five ways of being,

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.554
these are the exact same ways of being you need

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.590
in order to be a good scientist.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.617
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.

00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:23.757
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:26.410
for anything that is creative.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.613
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.

00:04:30.613 --> 00:04:33.403
That's actually what an experiment is.

00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:35.322
So armed with these two ideas,

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:39.644
that science is a way of being and experiments are play,

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:43.097
we asked, can anyone become a scientist?

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.597
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:50.104
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena

00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:53.651
down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this

00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:57.895
was to not just get the kids to see science differently,

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:02.493
but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?

00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:05.901
The first step was to ask a question.

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.781
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study

00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:12.111
because the scientists said small children couldn't make

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:16.413
a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:20.147
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.

00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:22.966
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:27.406
so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:32.024
were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?

00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:34.684
So they were asking questions that were significant

00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.814
to expert scientists.

00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:40.948
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?

00:05:40.948 --> 00:05:43.560
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.894
and she's now one of the youngest published scientists

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:49.777
in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,

00:05:49.777 --> 00:05:53.475
will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:56.350
Now, science and asking questions is about courage.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.550
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.937
going to stand up here and talk to you all.

00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:06.191
So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:13.376
(Applause)

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:15.895
So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call

00:06:15.895 --> 00:06:18.561
the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.106
the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:22.825
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought

00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:26.226
that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes

00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:29.250
in the way that we think, because we look alike.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.939
But we wondered if there's a possible link

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:36.643
with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees

00:06:36.643 --> 00:06:40.756
thought similar, since they seem so different from us.

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:43.809
So we asked if humans and bees might solve

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.216
complex problems in the same way.

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:49.503
Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:53.210
themselves to new situations using previously learned rules

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.424
and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?

00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:59.976
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:02.501
with only one million brain cells.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:04.643
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should,

00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:07.920
because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.533
regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:17.275
or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:21.057
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment,

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:24.359
which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:27.660
this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.126
Amy, can you tell us what the game was,

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.269
and the puzzle that you set the bees?

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.292
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:37.937
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,

00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:40.605
but to a certain color flower only

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:42.237
when it's in a certain pattern.

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:45.496
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:48.556
if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:51.824
or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.

00:07:51.824 --> 00:07:54.409
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:57.834
to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?

00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:00.614
What was really exciting about this project was we,

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.957
and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.

00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.411
It was completely new, and no one had done it before,

00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:09.134
including adults. (Laughter)

00:08:09.134 --> 00:08:12.598
BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:15.502
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,

00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:18.046
because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:19.671
not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day --

00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:22.270
so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.479
the collaborator on this project. Okay?

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.211
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study

00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:29.849
because actually you can read about it, but the next step

00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:33.494
is observation. So here are some of the students

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:36.262
doing the observations. They're recording the data

00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:41.306
of where the bees fly.

00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:43.329
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C.

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:47.319
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:50.916
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:53.820
BL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.530
Student: There's two up there.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.404
And three in here.

00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:03.679
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:07.452
They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.

00:09:07.452 --> 00:09:09.383
And now we want to share. That's the next step.

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:10.991
So we're going to write this up and try to submit this

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:13.847
for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.

00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:18.360
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.644
The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.730
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.537
an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.

00:09:25.537 --> 00:09:28.141
The introduction says, what's the question and why?

00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:31.260
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.403
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?

00:09:33.403 --> 00:09:35.862
That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)

00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:40.391
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,

00:09:40.391 --> 00:09:43.638
which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:46.166
It's not written by me. It's written by Amy

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:49.486
and the other students in the class. As a consequence,

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:55.503
this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)

00:09:55.503 --> 00:10:00.815
The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)

00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.011
And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees

00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:06.328
into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)

00:10:06.328 --> 00:10:10.161
This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.

00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:12.995
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:15.846
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.

00:10:15.846 --> 00:10:17.896
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because

00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:21.142
if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"

00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:24.199
and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:27.531
and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:31.450
"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.010
In other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.536
the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:40.889
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:44.422
who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,

00:10:44.422 --> 00:10:47.871
and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — (Laughter) —

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:49.968
"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:54.239
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:57.605
The work would be publishable if done by adults."

00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:59.584
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.

00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:01.173
They say no.

00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:03.627
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:07.634
a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:11.762
putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.

00:11:11.762 --> 00:11:15.089
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:19.510
and it was published. Okay? (Applause)

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.510
(Applause)

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.531
It took four months to do the science,

00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.759
two years to get it published. (Laughter)

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:36.594
Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and

00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.027
her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.

00:11:39.027 --> 00:11:41.043
What was the feedback like?

00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:43.928
Well, it was published two days before Christmas,

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:47.931
downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?

00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:51.971
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.

00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:54.513
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:58.193
It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.

00:11:58.193 --> 00:12:00.892
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper

00:12:00.892 --> 00:12:04.996
by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:07.544
and teachers but the public as well.

00:12:07.544 --> 00:12:09.316
And I'll just read one.

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:11.806
"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have

00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:14.119
words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:16.598
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.

00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:19.707
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:21.431
and most important things to do science.

00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:23.909
Who else can have these qualities more than children?

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:27.450
Please congratulate your children's team from my side."

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.833
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.801
Can I do it on you? (Laughter)

00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:36.894
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.

00:12:36.894 --> 00:12:42.071
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)

00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:48.169
For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)

00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:49.745
And you like technology, right?

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:51.921
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.

00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:54.872
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.

00:12:54.872 --> 00:12:58.480
Now ... (Laughter)

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.360
Okay. (Laughter)

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.444
Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?

00:13:05.444 --> 00:13:09.463
You have to close your eyes, and you have to point

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:12.620
where you hear me clapping. All right?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.018
(Clapping)

00:13:17.018 --> 00:13:20.162
(Clapping)

00:13:20.162 --> 00:13:23.065
Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?

00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:25.966
Audience: (Shouts)

00:13:25.966 --> 00:13:30.412
(Laughter)

00:13:30.412 --> 00:13:33.583
(Shouts) (Laughter)

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:37.224
Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.

00:13:37.224 --> 00:13:40.026
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts)

00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:45.958
Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.188
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:50.188 --> 00:13:53.901
What's the point? The point is what science does for us.

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:56.307
Right? We normally walk through life responding,

00:13:56.307 --> 00:13:58.519
but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:01.208
step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:03.590
he was able to see the world in a new way.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.758
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility

00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:10.774
to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:13.798
Now, true science education I think should be about

00:14:13.798 --> 00:14:17.197
giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,

00:14:17.197 --> 00:14:21.566
so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.

00:14:21.566 --> 00:14:24.671
So, Amy?

00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.224
AO: This project was really exciting for me,

00:14:27.224 --> 00:14:29.895
because it brought the process of discovery to life,

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:32.806
and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:35.559
has the potential to discover something new,

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:39.631
and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.

00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:42.283
Changing the way a person thinks about something

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:45.995
can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person

00:14:45.995 --> 00:14:47.483
feels about change.

00:14:47.483 --> 00:14:49.935
But changing the way I thought about science was

00:14:49.935 --> 00:14:52.210
surprisingly easy. Once we played the games

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.628
and then started to think about the puzzle,

00:14:54.628 --> 00:14:58.485
I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:01.679
and that anyone can discover something new.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:04.879
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:07.515
in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.

00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:11.876
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:19.623
(Applause)
