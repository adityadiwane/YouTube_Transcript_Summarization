00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
make education seem like a bright idea.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
(Laughter)

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Great creativity can make politicians electable,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
or parties unelectable.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
and phrases on our lips.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
through an impenetrable moral maze.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
more magical. And now we need that magic.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
This is a time of need.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
To tempt us to act differently

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
with delightful creative scraps.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
using creativity to inspire people to be greener.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
and broken his heart.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Sure, she had aged a little.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
In fact, she had aged a lot.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
But he felt all his old passion for her return.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
for that was his name.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Let's go there and make love. In the tent."

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
The earth moved for both of them.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
And they lived together happily ever after.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160
And all because he decided to walk that day.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:54.160
(Applause)

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
The moral imperative is on the table.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Great creativity is needed to take it all,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
make it simple and sharp.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
So this is a call, a plea,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
to the incredibly talented TED community.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
Let's get creative against climate change.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And let's do it soon. Thank you.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160
(Applause)
