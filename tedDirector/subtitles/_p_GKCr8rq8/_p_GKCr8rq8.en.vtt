00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:19.963
So we humans have an extraordinary
potential for goodness,

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:24.363
but also an immense power to do harm.

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:30.029
Any tool can be used to build
or to destroy.

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:33.217
That all depends on our motivation.

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:36.664
Therefore, it is all the more important

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:40.938
to foster an altruistic motivation
rather than a selfish one.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:49.008
So now we indeed are facing 
many challenges in our times.

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.325
Those could be personal challenges.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:56.911
Our own mind can be our best friend
or our worst enemy.

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.225
There's also societal challenges:

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:06.924
poverty in the midst of plenty,
inequalities, conflict, injustice.

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:11.120
And then there are the new challenges,
which we don't expect.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.763
Ten thousand years ago, there were
about five million human beings on Earth.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:17.373
Whatever they could do,

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:22.559
the Earth's resilience 
would soon heal human activities.

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.775
After the Industrial
and Technological Revolutions,

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.008
that's not the same anymore.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:32.073
We are now the major agent
of impact on our Earth.

00:01:32.073 --> 00:01:36.977
We enter the Anthropocene,
the era of human beings.

00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:43.970
So in a way, if we were to say
we need to continue this endless growth,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.616
endless use of material resources,

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:50.514
it's like if this man was saying --

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:55.386
and I heard a former head of state,
I won't mention who, saying --

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:59.395
"Five years ago, we were at
the edge of the precipice.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:01.972
Today we made a big step forward."

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:08.590
So this edge is the same
that has been defined by scientists

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.244
as the planetary boundaries.

00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:15.705
And within those boundaries,
they can carry a number of factors.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:21.231
We can still prosper, humanity can still
prosper for 150,000 years

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:24.563
if we keep the same stability of climate

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:27.721
as in the Holocene
for the last 10,000 years.

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:33.479
But this depends on choosing
a voluntary simplicity,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.160
growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.394
So in 1900, as you can see,
we were well within the limits of safety.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:47.793
Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:52.762
Now hold your breath, not too long,
to imagine what comes next.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:58.907
Now we have vastly overrun
some of the planetary boundaries.

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.866
Just to take biodiversity, 
at the current rate,

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:09.288
by 2050, 30 percent of all species 
on Earth will have disappeared.

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:15.085
Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,
that's not going to be reversible.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.936
So here I am sitting

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:22.836
in front of a 7,000-meter-high, 
21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:29.987
At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers
are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:32.994
So what can we do in that situation?

00:03:34.144 --> 00:03:41.453
Well, however complex
politically, economically, scientifically

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:43.851
the question of the environment is,

00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:50.678
it simply boils down to a question
of altruism versus selfishness.

00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:54.287
I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:55.712
(Laughter)

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:59.121
Groucho Marx said, "Why should I care
about future generations?

00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:01.151
What have they ever done for me?"

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:02.647
(Laughter)

00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:07.430
Unfortunately, I heard
the billionaire Steve Forbes,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.958
on Fox News, saying exactly 
the same thing, but seriously.

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.293
He was told about the rise of the ocean,

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:16.640
and he said, "I find it absurd
to change my behavior today

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.695
for something that will happen 
in a hundred years."

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.593
So if you don't care
for future generations,

00:04:22.593 --> 00:04:25.494
just go for it.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.420
So one of the main challenges of our times

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.538
is to reconcile three time scales:

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.683
the short term of the economy,

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:37.915
the ups and downs of the stock market,
the end-of-the-year accounts;

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:40.621
the midterm of the quality of life --

00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:45.945
what is the quality every moment of our 
life, over 10 years and 20 years? --

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:49.554
and the long term of the environment.

00:04:49.554 --> 00:04:51.903
When the environmentalists
speak with economists,

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.982
it's like a schizophrenic dialogue,
completely incoherent.

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.814
They don't speak the same language.

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:01.354
Now, for the last 10 years,
I went around the world

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:05.452
meeting economists, scientists,
neuroscientists, environmentalists,

00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:09.912
philosophers, thinkers 
in the Himalayas, all over the place.

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:13.834
It seems to me, there's only one concept

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:16.794
that can reconcile
those three time scales.

00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:21.198
It is simply having more
consideration for others.

00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:26.099
If you have more consideration for others,
you will have a caring economics,

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.051
where finance is at the service of society

00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.319
and not society at the service of finance.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.187
You will not play at the casino

00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:37.073
with the resources that people
have entrusted you with.

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:39.919
If you have more consideration for others,

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.396
you will make sure
that you remedy inequality,

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:47.136
that you bring some kind 
of well-being within society,

00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:49.176
in education, at the workplace.

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:52.599
Otherwise, a nation that is
the most powerful and the richest

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.686
but everyone is miserable,
what's the point?

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.973
And if you have more
consideration for others,

00:05:57.973 --> 00:06:01.369
you are not going to ransack
that planet that we have

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:05.703
and at the current rate, we don't
have three planets to continue that way.

00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:08.056
So the question is,

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:12.387
okay, altruism is the answer,
it's not just a novel ideal,

00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:15.611
but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?

00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:18.469
And first of all, does it exist,

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.213
true altruism, or are we so selfish?

00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:27.553
So some philosophers thought
we were irredeemably selfish.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:32.765
But are we really all just like rascals?

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:35.579
That's good news, isn't it?

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:38.108
Many philosophers, 
like Hobbes, have said so.

00:06:38.108 --> 00:06:41.429
But not everyone looks like a rascal.

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:44.262
Or is man a wolf for man?

00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:47.150
But this guy doesn't seem too bad.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.073
He's one of my friends in Tibet.

00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:52.312
He's very kind.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:55.937
So now, we love cooperation.

00:06:55.937 --> 00:07:00.275
There's no better joy 
than working together, is there?

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:04.350
And then not only humans.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.837
Then, of course, there's
the struggle for life,

00:07:06.837 --> 00:07:11.178
the survival of the fittest,
social Darwinism.

00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:17.015
But in evolution, cooperation --
though competition exists, of course --

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:22.732
cooperation has to be much more creative
to go to increased levels of complexity.

00:07:22.732 --> 00:07:27.414
We are super-cooperators 
and we should even go further.

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:33.443
So now, on top of that,
the quality of human relationships.

00:07:33.443 --> 00:07:37.925
The OECD did a survey among 10 factors,
including income, everything.

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:41.268
The first one that people said,
that's the main thing for my happiness,

00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:44.621
is quality of social relationships.

00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.498
Not only in humans.

00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:50.844
And look at those great-grandmothers.

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:56.000
So now, this idea 
that if we go deep within,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.570
we are irredeemably selfish,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.224
this is armchair science.

00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:03.491
There is not a single sociological study,

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:06.737
psychological study,
that's ever shown that.

00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:08.697
Rather, the opposite.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.355
My friend, Daniel Batson, 
spent a whole life

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:15.118
putting people in the lab
in very complex situations.

00:08:15.118 --> 00:08:19.487
And of course we are sometimes selfish,
and some people more than others.

00:08:19.487 --> 00:08:22.149
But he found that systematically,
no matter what,

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:25.149
there's a significant number of people

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:28.504
who do behave altruistically,
no matter what.

00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:31.696
If you see someone
deeply wounded, great suffering,

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:34.318
you might just help
out of empathic distress --

00:08:34.318 --> 00:08:38.468
you can't stand it, so it's better to help
than to keep on looking at that person.

00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:44.344
So we tested all that, and in the end, 
he said, clearly people can be altruistic.

00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:46.284
So that's good news.

00:08:46.284 --> 00:08:51.896
And even further, we should look
at the banality of goodness.

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:53.600
Now look at here.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.370
When we come out, we aren't 
going to say, "That's so nice.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.937
There was no fistfight while this mob 
was thinking about altruism."

00:09:00.937 --> 00:09:03.099
No, that's expected, isn't it?

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:06.278
If there was a fistfight,
we would speak of that for months.

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:09.949
So the banality of goodness is something
that doesn't attract your attention,

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:11.437
but it exists.

00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:16.913
Now, look at this.

00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:24.054
So some psychologists said,

00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:27.291
when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian 
projects in the Himalayas

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.545
that give me so much joy,

00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:32.799
they said, "Oh, I see,
you work for the warm glow.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:35.703
That is not altruistic.
You just feel good."

00:09:35.703 --> 00:09:38.991
You think this guy,
when he jumped in front of the train,

00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:41.277
he thought, "I'm going to feel
so good when this is over?"

00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:43.563
(Laughter)

00:09:43.563 --> 00:09:45.849
But that's not the end of it.

00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:48.391
They say, well, but when
you interviewed him, he said,

00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:51.526
"I had no choice.
I had to jump, of course."

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:55.407
He has no choice. Automatic behavior.
It's neither selfish nor altruistic.

00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:56.882
No choice?

00:09:56.882 --> 00:09:59.844
Well of course, this guy's
not going to think for half an hour,

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:01.881
"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"

00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:05.676
He does it. There is a choice,
but it's obvious, it's immediate.

00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:08.037
And then, also, there he had a choice.

00:10:08.037 --> 00:10:10.738
(Laughter)

00:10:10.738 --> 00:10:14.500
There are people who had choice,
like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.187
and the whole village
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:21.135
For the whole Second World War,
they saved 3,500 Jews,

00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:23.792
gave them shelter,
brought them to Switzerland,

00:10:23.792 --> 00:10:27.237
against all odds, at the risk
of their lives and those of their family.

00:10:27.237 --> 00:10:29.394
So altruism does exist.

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:31.119
So what is altruism?

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:35.021
It is the wish: May others be happy
and find the cause of happiness.

00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:40.266
Now, empathy is the affective resonance
or cognitive resonance that tells you,

00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:42.977
this person is joyful,
this person suffers.

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:46.463
But empathy alone is not sufficient.

00:10:46.463 --> 00:10:48.686
If you keep on being
confronted with suffering,

00:10:48.686 --> 00:10:51.447
you might have empathic distress, burnout,

00:10:51.447 --> 00:10:55.507
so you need the greater sphere
of loving-kindness.

00:10:55.507 --> 00:10:58.234
With Tania Singer at the Max Planck 
Institute of Leipzig,

00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:04.335
we showed that the brain networks for
empathy and loving-kindness are different.

00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:06.416
Now, that's all well done,

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:11.790
so we got that from evolution,
from maternal care, parental love,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.625
but we need to extend that.

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:16.968
It can be extended even to other species.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:21.375
Now, if we want a more altruistic society,
we need two things:

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.592
individual change and societal change.

00:11:24.592 --> 00:11:27.150
So is individual change possible?

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.349
Two thousand years
of contemplative study said yes, it is.

00:11:30.349 --> 00:11:33.951
Now, 15 years of collaboration
with neuroscience and epigenetics

00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:38.435
said yes, our brains change
when you train in altruism.

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:42.707
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.

00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:45.493
This is the first time I went
after two and a half hours.

00:11:45.493 --> 00:11:49.167
And then the result has been published
in many scientific papers.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.749
It shows without ambiguity
that there is structural change

00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:56.502
and functional change in the brain
when you train the altruistic love.

00:11:56.502 --> 00:11:58.252
Just to give you an idea:

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:01.073
this is the meditator at rest on the left,

00:12:01.073 --> 00:12:04.776
meditator in compassion meditation,
you see all the activity,

00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:07.330
and then the control group at rest,
nothing happened,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.272
in meditation, nothing happened.

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:11.250
They have not been trained.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.671
So do you need 50,000 hours 
of meditation? No, you don't.

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.837
Four weeks, 20 minutes a day,
of caring, mindfulness meditation

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:26.141
already brings a structural change
in the brain compared to a control group.

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:29.879
That's only 20 minutes a day
for four weeks.

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:33.217
Even with preschoolers --
Richard Davidson did that in Madison.

00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:39.627
An eight-week program: gratitude, loving-
kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.

00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:41.882
You would say, 
"Oh, they're just preschoolers."

00:12:41.882 --> 00:12:43.508
Look after eight weeks,

00:12:43.508 --> 00:12:45.958
the pro-social behavior,
that's the blue line.

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:51.402
And then comes the ultimate
scientific test, the stickers test.

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:55.350
Before, you determine for each child
who is their best friend in the class,

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.425
their least favorite child,
an unknown child, and the sick child,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:02.129
and they have to give stickers away.

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:06.181
So before the intervention,
they give most of it to their best friend.

00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:09.640
Four, five years old, 
20 minutes three times a week.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.123
After the intervention,
no more discrimination:

00:13:13.123 --> 00:13:17.048
the same amount of stickers to their 
best friend and the least favorite child.

00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:20.436
That's something we should do
in all the schools in the world.

00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:22.430
Now where do we go from there?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.678
(Applause)

00:13:26.678 --> 00:13:29.359
When the Dalai Lama heard that,
he told Richard Davidson,

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:32.815
"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,
the U.N., the whole world."

00:13:32.815 --> 00:13:34.499
So now where do we go from there?

00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:36.762
Individual change is possible.

00:13:36.762 --> 00:13:41.378
Now do we have to wait for an altruistic 
gene to be in the human race?

00:13:41.378 --> 00:13:45.132
That will take 50,000 years,
too much for the environment.

00:13:45.132 --> 00:13:49.567
Fortunately, there is
the evolution of culture.

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:55.301
Cultures, as specialists have shown,
change faster than genes.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.829
That's the good news.

00:13:56.829 --> 00:14:00.189
Look, attitude towards war
has dramatically changed over the years.

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:05.370
So now individual change and cultural 
change mutually fashion each other,

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.146
and yes, we can achieve
a more altruistic society.

00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:09.888
So where do we go from there?

00:14:09.888 --> 00:14:12.137
Myself, I will go back to the East.

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:15.597
Now we treat 100,000 patients
a year in our projects.

00:14:15.597 --> 00:14:19.346
We have 25,000 kids in school,
four percent overhead.

00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:21.921
Some people say, "Well,
your stuff works in practice,

00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:23.945
but does it work in theory?"

00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:27.287
There's always positive deviance.

00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:29.706
So I will also go back to my hermitage

00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:32.995
to find the inner resources
to better serve others.

00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:36.182
But on the more global level,
what can we do?

00:14:36.182 --> 00:14:37.973
We need three things.

00:14:37.973 --> 00:14:40.325
Enhancing cooperation:

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:44.041
Cooperative learning in the school
instead of competitive learning,

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:47.612
Unconditional cooperation
within corporations --

00:14:47.612 --> 00:14:52.019
there can be some competition
between corporations, but not within.

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:55.971
We need sustainable harmony.
I love this term.

00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:57.914
Not sustainable growth anymore.

00:14:57.914 --> 00:15:01.500
Sustainable harmony means now
we will reduce inequality.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.826
In the future, we do more with less,

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:10.310
and we continue to grow qualitatively,
not quantitatively.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.615
We need caring economics.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:18.446
The Homo economicus cannot deal
with poverty in the midst of plenty,

00:15:18.446 --> 00:15:20.798
cannot deal with the problem
of the common goods

00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:23.096
of the atmosphere, of the oceans.

00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:24.679
We need a caring economics.

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:26.788
If you say economics
should be compassionate,

00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:28.273
they say, "That's not our job."

00:15:28.273 --> 00:15:31.588
But if you say they don't care,
that looks bad.

00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:34.967
We need local commitment,
global responsibility.

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:40.307
We need to extend altruism
to the other 1.6 million species.

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:43.732
Sentient beings 
are co-citizens in this world.

00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:46.724
and we need to dare altruism.

00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:50.605
So, long live the altruistic revolution.

00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:55.155
Viva la revolución de altruismo.

00:15:55.155 --> 00:16:00.515
(Applause)

00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:02.496
Thank you.

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.448
(Applause)
