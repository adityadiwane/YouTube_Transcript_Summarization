00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:28.824
I'm often asked,

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:31.296
"What surprised you about the book?"

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.477
And I say, "That I got to write it."

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.655
I would have never imagined that.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.880
Not in my wildest dreams did I think --

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.182
I don't even consider
myself to be an author.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.487
And I'm often asked,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.976
"Why do you think so many
people have read this?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.226
This thing's selling still
about a million copies a month."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.976
And I think it's because
spiritual emptiness

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.888
is a universal disease.

00:00:59.912 --> 00:01:03.529
I think inside at some point, we put
our heads down on the pillow and we go,

00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:05.692
"There's got to be more
to life than this."

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:08.933
Get up in the morning, go to work,
come home and watch TV,

00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:12.617
go to bed, get up in the morning, go
to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.000
go to parties on weekends.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:19.970
A lot of people say, "I'm living." No,
you're not living -- that's just existing.

00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:21.513
Just existing.

00:01:21.537 --> 00:01:24.569
I really think that
there's this inner desire.

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:29.268
I do believe what Chris said;
I believe that you're not an accident.

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:34.178
Your parents may not have planned you,
but I believe God did.

00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:37.433
I think there are accidental parents;
there's no doubt about that.

00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:39.532
I don't think there are accidental kids.

00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:42.441
And I think you matter.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.553
I think you matter to God;
I think you matter to history;

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:48.544
I think you matter to this universe.

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:52.172
And I think that the difference

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:56.976
between what I call the survival level
of living, the success level of living,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
and the significance level of living is:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.682
Do you figure out,
"What on Earth am I here for?"

00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:05.894
I meet a lot of people who are very smart,

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:08.381
and say, "But why can't I
figure out my problems?"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.641
And I meet a lot of people
who are very successful,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.680
who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.021
Why do I feel like a fake?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.737
Why do I feel like I've got to pretend
that I'm more than I really am?"

00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:27.308
I think that comes down to this issue
of meaning, of significance, of purpose.

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:30.351
I think it comes down to this issue of:

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:33.914
"Why am I here? What am I here for?
Where am I going?"

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:36.114
These are not religious issues.

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.112
They're human issues.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.976
I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke
that I really appreciate what he does,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.150
because it makes my life work
a whole lot easier.

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:50.976
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:54.801
And I have learned that there are
kooks in every area of life.

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:59.772
Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that,

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:01.833
but there are plenty of religious kooks.

00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:05.244
There are secular kooks;
there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.879
There are people -- a lady
came up to me the other day,

00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:11.218
and she had a white piece of paper --
Michael, you'll like this one --

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:13.068
and she said, "What do you see in it?"

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.832
And I looked at it and I said,
"Oh, I don't see anything."

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.828
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus,"
and started crying and left.

00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:23.356
I'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine."

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.540
(Laughter)

00:03:25.564 --> 00:03:26.714
Good for you.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.331
When the book became the best-selling book
in the world for the last three years,

00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:35.510
I kind of had my little crisis.

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:39.000
And that was: What is the purpose of this?

00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:43.556
Because it brought in
enormous amounts of money.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.001
When you write the best-selling
book in the world,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.767
it's tons and tons of money.

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:52.169
And it brought in a lot of attention,
neither of which I wanted.

00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:55.188
When I started Saddleback Church,
I was 25 years old.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.015
I started it with
one other family in 1980.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.976
And I decided that I was never
going to go on TV,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.922
because I didn't want to be a celebrity.

00:04:04.946 --> 00:04:08.127
I didn't want to be a, quote,
"evangelist, televangelist" --

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:10.000
that's not my thing.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:15.170
And all of the sudden, it brought a lot
of money and a lot of attention.

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:16.734
I don't think --

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:17.999
now, this is a worldview,

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.473
and I will tell you,
everybody's got a worldview.

00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:23.096
Everybody's betting
their life on something.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.957
You're betting your life on something,

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.385
you just better know why
you're betting what you're betting on.

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.690
So, everybody's betting
their life on something.

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:35.620
And when I, you know, made a bet,

00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:38.556
I happened to believe
that Jesus was who he said he was.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.118
And I believe in a pluralistic society,

00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:44.079
everybody's betting on something.

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.502
And when I started the church,

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:52.092
you know, I had no plans
to do what it's doing now.

00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.028
And then when I wrote this book,

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:59.577
and all of a sudden, it just took off,

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.188
and I started saying, now,
what's the purpose of this?

00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:03.933
Because as I started to say,

00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:06.153
I don't think you're given money or fame

00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:07.757
for your own ego, ever.

00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:10.788
I just don't believe that.

00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:14.558
And when you write a book
that the first sentence of the book is,

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.004
"It's not about you,"

00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:20.408
then, when all of a sudden it becomes
the best-selling book in history,

00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:22.995
you've got to figure, well,
I guess it's not about me.

00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:25.307
That's kind of a no-brainer.

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.867
So, what is it for?

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:32.349
And I began to think about what I call
the "stewardship of affluence"

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:34.976
and the "stewardship of influence."

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.104
So I believe, essentially,
leadership is stewardship.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.425
That if you are a leader in any area --

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.965
in business, in politics,
in sports, in art,

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:47.057
in academics, in any area --

00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.383
you don't own it.

00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:51.279
You are a steward of it.

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.980
For instance, that's why I believe
in protecting the environment.

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:56.564
This is not my planet.

00:05:56.588 --> 00:06:00.051
It wasn't mine before I was born,
it's not going to be mine after I die,

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:03.246
I'm just here for 80 years
and then that's it.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.367
I was debating
the other day on a talk show,

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:09.404
and the guy was challenging
me and he'd go,

00:06:09.428 --> 00:06:12.000
"What's a pastor doing
on protecting the environment?"

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:16.633
And I asked this guy, I said,
"Well, do you believe

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:20.540
that human beings are responsible

00:06:20.564 --> 00:06:24.325
to make the world a little bit better
place for the next generation?

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.580
Do you think we have a stewardship here,
to take the environment seriously?"

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:30.612
And he said, "No."

00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:32.439
I said, "Oh, you don't?"

00:06:32.463 --> 00:06:34.288
I said, "Let me make this clear again:

00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:38.258
Do you believe that as human beings --
I'm not talking about religion --

00:06:38.282 --> 00:06:41.154
do you believe that as human beings,
it is our responsibility

00:06:41.178 --> 00:06:42.520
to take care of this planet,

00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:45.467
and make it just a little bit better
for the next generation?"

00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:49.000
And he said, "No. Not any more
than any other species."

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.787
When he said the word "species,"
he was revealing his worldview.

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:55.576
And he was saying,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.615
"I'm no more responsible to take care
of this environment than a duck is."

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.477
Well now, I know a lot
of times we act like ducks,

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.699
but you're not a duck.

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:06.805
You're not a duck.

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:10.421
And you are responsible --
that's my worldview.

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:15.672
And so, you need to understand
what your worldview is.

00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:19.196
The problem is most people
never really think it through.

00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:23.722
They never really ...

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:27.079
codify it or qualify it or quantify it,

00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:31.185
and say, "This is what I believe in.
This is why I believe what I believe."

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.207
I don't personally have
enough faith to be an atheist.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.485
But you may, you may.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.089
Your worldview, though, does determine
everything else in your life,

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.835
because it determines your decisions;

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:47.248
it determines your relationships;

00:07:47.272 --> 00:07:49.511
it determines your level of confidence.

00:07:50.082 --> 00:07:52.757
It determines, really,
everything in your life.

00:07:53.277 --> 00:07:55.054
What we believe, obviously --

00:07:55.078 --> 00:07:57.785
and you know this --
determines our behavior,

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:01.571
and our behavior determines
what we become in life.

00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:05.976
So all of this money started pouring in,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.944
and all of this fame started pouring in.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And I'm going, what do I do with this?

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:17.000
My wife and I first made five decisions
on what to do with the money.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.077
We said, "First, we're not
going to use it on ourselves."

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.754
I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:26.874
I don't own a guesthouse.

00:08:26.898 --> 00:08:30.000
I still drive the same four year-old
Ford that I've driven.

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:32.802
We just said, we're not
going to use it on us.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.330
The second thing was,

00:08:36.354 --> 00:08:39.782
I stopped taking a salary
from the church that I pastor.

00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:43.021
Third thing is, I added up
all that the church had paid me

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:45.733
over the last 25 years,
and I gave it back.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.400
And I gave it back because
I didn't want anybody thinking

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:51.732
that I do what I do for money -- I don't.

00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:55.400
In fact, personally, I've never met

00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:58.816
a priest or a pastor or a minister
who does it for money.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.895
I know that's the stereotype;
I've never met one of them.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:05.000
Believe me, there's a whole lot
easier ways to make money.

00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:09.581
Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,
they're like doctors.

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:13.049
I left late today -- I'd hoped
to be here yesterday --

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:16.523
because my father-in-law
is in his last, probably, 48 hours

00:09:16.547 --> 00:09:17.873
before he dies of cancer.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:20.976
And I'm watching a guy
who's lived his life --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.956
he's now in his mid-80s --
and he's dying with peace.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:30.061
You know, the test of your worldview
is not how you act in the good times.

00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:34.193
The test of your worldview
is how you act at the funeral.

00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:39.370
And having been through literally
hundreds if not thousands of funerals,

00:09:39.394 --> 00:09:40.719
it makes a difference.

00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:43.203
It makes a difference what you believe.

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:48.374
So, we gave it all back,

00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:51.236
and then we set up three foundations,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.657
working on some of the major
problems of the world:

00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:59.531
illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --
particularly HIV/AIDS --

00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:03.733
and set up these three foundations,
and put the money into that.

00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:07.098
The last thing we did is we became
what I call "reverse tithers."

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:14.348
And that is, when my wife
and I got married 30 years ago,

00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:17.915
we started tithing.

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:20.028
Now, that's a principle in the Bible

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:23.135
that says give 10 percent
of what you get back to charity,

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.000
give it away to help other people.

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:29.861
So, we started doing that, and each year
we would raise our tithe one percent.

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:32.383
So, our first year of marriage
we went to 11 percent,

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.044
second year we went to 12 percent,

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:36.814
and the third year we went to 13 percent,

00:10:36.838 --> 00:10:38.093
and on and on and on.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.545
Why did I do that?

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:42.161
Because every time I give,

00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:45.000
it breaks the grip
of materialism in my life.

00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:50.821
Materialism is all about getting --
get, get, get, get all you can,

00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:53.568
can all you get, sit on the can
and spoil the rest.

00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:58.515
It's all about more, having more.

00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:02.634
And we think that the good life
is actually looking good --

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:04.149
that's most important of all --

00:11:04.173 --> 00:11:07.857
looking good, feeling good
and having the goods.

00:11:08.754 --> 00:11:10.150
But that's not the good life.

00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:14.744
I meet people all the time who have
those, and they're not necessarily happy.

00:11:14.768 --> 00:11:16.976
If money actually made you happy,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.953
then the wealthiest people
in the world would be the happiest.

00:11:19.977 --> 00:11:22.381
And that I know, personally,
I know, is not true.

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:24.079
It's just not true.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.831
So, the good life is not about looking
good, feeling good or having the goods,

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.084
it's about being good and doing good.

00:11:32.102 --> 00:11:33.976
Giving your life away.

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:38.247
Significance in life
doesn't come from status,

00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:41.154
because you can always find
somebody who's got more than you.

00:11:41.178 --> 00:11:42.694
It doesn't come from sex.

00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:44.534
It doesn't come from salary.

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.976
It comes from serving.

00:11:47.658 --> 00:11:50.379
It is in giving our lives away
that we find meaning,

00:11:50.403 --> 00:11:51.791
we find significance.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.593
That's the way we were wired,
I believe, by God.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.976
And so we began to give away,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.976
and now after 30 years,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.858
my wife and I are reverse tithers --
we give away 90 percent and live on 10.

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:08.925
That, actually, was the easy part.

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:11.678
The hard part is, what do I do
with all this attention?

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:15.303
Because I started getting
all kinds of invitations.

00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:19.264
I just came off a nearly
month-long speaking tour

00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:21.093
on three different continents,

00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:23.807
and I won't go into that,

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:25.794
but it was an amazing thing.

00:12:26.452 --> 00:12:30.323
And I'm going, what do I do
with this notoriety

00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:31.791
that the book has brought?

00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:36.055
And, being a pastor,
I started reading the Bible.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.379
There's a chapter in the Bible
called Psalm 72,

00:12:39.403 --> 00:12:43.148
and it's Solomon's prayer
for more influence.

00:12:43.172 --> 00:12:44.976
When you read this prayer,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.960
it sounds incredibly
selfish, self-centered.

00:12:49.023 --> 00:12:51.559
He says, "God, I want you
to make me famous."

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:53.023
That's what he prays.

00:12:53.047 --> 00:12:54.914
He said, "I want you to make me famous.

00:12:54.938 --> 00:12:57.771
I want you to spread the fame
of my name through every land,

00:12:57.795 --> 00:13:01.106
I want you to give me power.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.745
I want you to make me famous,
I want you to give me influence."

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.000
And it just sounds like the most
egotistical request you could make,

00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:09.348
if you were going to pray.

00:13:10.444 --> 00:13:13.093
Until you read the whole psalm,
the whole chapter.

00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:15.735
And then he says,
"So that the king ..." --

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:20.546
he was the king of Israel
at that time, at its apex in power --

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.309
"... so that the king may care
for the widow and orphan,

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:28.337
support the oppressed, defend
the defenseless, care for the sick,

00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.976
assist the poor,
speak up for the foreigner,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.976
those in prison."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.169
Basically, he's talking about
all the marginalized in society.

00:13:37.757 --> 00:13:39.346
And as I read that,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.800
I looked at it, and I thought, you know,

00:13:42.824 --> 00:13:46.771
what this is saying is that the purpose
of influence is to speak up

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:48.866
for those who have no influence.

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.452
The purpose of influence
is not to build your ego.

00:13:55.992 --> 00:13:57.144
Or your net worth.

00:13:57.168 --> 00:14:00.820
And, by the way, your net worth is not
the same thing as your self-worth.

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:04.564
Your value is not based on your valuables.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.297
It's based on a whole
different set of things.

00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:11.837
And so the purpose
of influence is to speak up

00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:13.401
for those who have no influence.

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:15.339
And I had to admit:

00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:18.389
I can't think of the last time
I thought of widows and orphans.

00:14:18.413 --> 00:14:20.513
They're not on my radar.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:24.449
I pastor a church in one of the most
affluent areas of America --

00:14:24.473 --> 00:14:26.330
a bunch of gated communities.

00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:28.942
I have a church full
of CEOs and scientists.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.976
And I could go five years and never,
ever see a homeless person.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.976
They're just not in my pathway.

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:40.194
Now, they're 13 miles
up the road in Santa Ana.

00:14:41.867 --> 00:14:43.976
So I had to say, ok,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.785
I would use whatever affluence
and whatever influence I've got

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:51.379
to help those who don't have
either of those.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.341
You know, there's a story
in the Bible about Moses,

00:14:55.365 --> 00:14:58.944
whether you believe it's true or not,
it really doesn't matter to me.

00:14:58.968 --> 00:15:01.608
But Moses, if you saw the movie,
"The Ten Commandments,"

00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:04.915
Moses goes out, and there's this
burning bush, and God talks to him,

00:15:04.939 --> 00:15:08.694
and God says,
"Moses, what's in your hand?"

00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:14.102
I think that's one of the most important
questions you'll ever be asked:

00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:15.453
What's in your hand?

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:20.579
Moses says, "It's a staff.
It's a shepherd's staff."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.866
And God says, "Throw it down."

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.603
And if you saw the movie, you know,
he throws it down and it becomes a snake.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.406
And then God says, "Pick it up."

00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:33.976
And he picks it back up again,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.620
and it becomes a staff again.

00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:41.119
Now, I'm reading this thing,
and I'm going, what is that all about?

00:15:41.143 --> 00:15:44.456
OK. What's that all about? Well,
I do know a couple of things.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.595
Number one, God never does
a miracle to show off.

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:50.134
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:53.373
And, by the way, my God doesn't
have to show up on cheese bread.

00:15:53.881 --> 00:15:57.776
You know, if God's going to show up,
he's not going to show up on cheese bread.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.993
(Laughter)

00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:01.892
Ok? I just, this is why I love
what Michael does,

00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:06.574
because it's like, if he's debunking it,
then I don't have to.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:10.046
But God -- my God --
doesn't show up on sprinkler images.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.976
He's got a few more powerful ways
than that to do whatever he wants to do.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.082
But he doesn't do miracles
just to show off.

00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:20.405
Second thing is,
if God ever asks you a question,

00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:22.002
he already knows the answer.

00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:24.899
Obviously, if he's God,
then that would mean

00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:28.603
that when he asks the question,
it's for your benefit, not his.

00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:30.488
So he's going, "What's in your hand?"

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:31.976
Now, what was in Moses' hand?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Well, it was a shepherd's staff.
Now, follow me on this.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.442
This staff represented
three things about Moses' life.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:43.005
First, it represented his identity;
he was a shepherd.

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:46.328
It's the symbol of his own occupation:

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:47.653
I am a shepherd.

00:16:48.219 --> 00:16:50.976
It's a symbol of his identity,
his career, his job.

00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:54.519
Second, it's a symbol
of not only his identity,

00:16:54.543 --> 00:16:58.698
it's a symbol of his income, because all
of his assets are tied up in sheep.

00:16:58.722 --> 00:17:03.119
In those days, nobody had bank accounts,
or American Express cards, or hedge funds.

00:17:03.143 --> 00:17:05.857
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:09.959
So it's a symbol of his identity,
and it's a symbol of his income.

00:17:09.983 --> 00:17:12.626
And the third thing:
it's a symbol of his influence.

00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:16.655
What do you do with a shepherd's staff?

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:20.432
Well, you know, you move sheep
from point A to point B with it,

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.097
by hook or by crook.

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:25.169
You pull them or you poke them.
One or the other.

00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:28.333
So, he's saying,

00:17:28.357 --> 00:17:30.396
"You're going to lay down your identity.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.575
What's in your hand?

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:34.472
You've got identity, you've got income,
you've got influence.

00:17:34.496 --> 00:17:35.653
What's in your hand?"

00:17:36.498 --> 00:17:39.427
And he's saying, "If you lay it down,
I'll make it come alive.

00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:42.026
I'll do some things
you could never imagine possible."

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.544
And if you've watched that movie,
"Ten Commandments,"

00:17:44.568 --> 00:17:49.048
all of those big miracles that happen
in Egypt are done through this staff.

00:17:51.152 --> 00:17:56.207
Last year, I was invited to speak
at the NBA All-Stars game.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.976
And so, I'm talking to the players,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.301
because most of the NBA teams,
NFL teams and all the other teams

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:07.174
have done this 40 Days of Purpose,
based on the book.

00:18:07.508 --> 00:18:11.000
And I asked them, I said,
"What's in your hand?

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:15.569
So, what's in your hand?"
I said, "It's a basketball.

00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:20.128
And that basketball represents
your identity, who you are:

00:18:20.152 --> 00:18:21.626
you're an NBA player.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.222
It represents your income:

00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:25.825
you're making a lot of money
off that little ball.

00:18:26.182 --> 00:18:28.000
And it represents your influence.

00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:31.952
And even though you're only going
to be in the NBA for a few years,

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:34.763
you're going to be an NBA player
for the rest of your life.

00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:36.882
And that gives you enormous influence.

00:18:37.254 --> 00:18:40.529
So, what are you going to do
with what you've been given?"

00:18:41.785 --> 00:18:46.274
And I guess that's the main reason
I came up here today,

00:18:46.298 --> 00:18:49.227
to all of you very bright people at TED --

00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:51.148
it is to say, "What's in your hand?"

00:18:53.156 --> 00:18:56.675
What do you have that you've been given?

00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.976
Talent, background, education,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.159
freedom, networks, opportunities,

00:19:05.183 --> 00:19:08.726
wealth, ideas, creativity.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.799
What are you doing
with what you've been given?

00:19:12.823 --> 00:19:16.713
That, to me, is the primary
question about life.

00:19:16.737 --> 00:19:19.819
That, to me, is what being
purpose-driven is all about.

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:24.203
In the book, I talk about
how you're wired to do certain things,

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:27.896
you're "SHAPED" with -- a little acrostic:
Spiritual gifts, Heart,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.308
Ability, Personality and Experiences.

00:19:30.332 --> 00:19:31.976
These things shape you.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.544
And if you want to know what you ought
to be doing with your life,

00:19:35.568 --> 00:19:38.305
you need to look at your shape --
"What am I wired to do?"

00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:41.647
Why would God wire you to do something
and then not have you do it?

00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:44.919
If you're wired to be an anthropologist,
you'll be an anthropologist.

00:19:44.943 --> 00:19:46.951
If you're wired to be
an undersea explorer,

00:19:46.975 --> 00:19:48.467
you'll be an undersea explorer.

00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:50.657
If you're wired to make deals,
you make deals.

00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:52.640
If you're wired to paint, you paint.

00:19:53.355 --> 00:19:56.000
Did you know that God smiles
when you be you?

00:19:57.574 --> 00:19:59.921
When my little kids --
when my kids were little --

00:19:59.945 --> 00:20:01.952
they're all grown now, I have grandkids --

00:20:01.976 --> 00:20:04.288
I used to go in and sit
on the side of their bed,

00:20:04.312 --> 00:20:06.080
and I used to watch my kids sleep.

00:20:07.152 --> 00:20:12.598
And I just watched their little bodies
rise and lower, rise and lower.

00:20:12.622 --> 00:20:15.477
And I would look at them:
"This is not an accident."

00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:17.207
Rise and lower.

00:20:18.247 --> 00:20:22.000
And I got joy out of just
watching them sleep.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.567
Some people have the misguided idea
that God only gets excited

00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:29.711
when you're doing, quote,
"spiritual things,"

00:20:29.735 --> 00:20:32.448
like going to church or helping the poor,

00:20:32.472 --> 00:20:35.825
or, you know, confessing
or doing something like that.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.778
The bottom line is, God gets pleasure
watching you be you.

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:42.206
Why? He made you.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.287
And when you do what you were made to do,

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:49.358
he goes, "That's my boy! That's my girl!

00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:52.767
You're using the talent
and ability that I gave you."

00:20:53.513 --> 00:20:55.393
So my advice to you is:

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:57.147
look at what's in your hand --

00:20:57.171 --> 00:21:00.710
your identity, your influence,
your income --

00:21:01.861 --> 00:21:04.364
and say, "It's not about me.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.428
It's about making the world
a better place."

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:09.584
Thank you.
