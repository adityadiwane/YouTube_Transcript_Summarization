00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
And I see my life as a series of experiments.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
to live my life for me.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
So, they answered my emails.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
They answered my phone.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.160
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It was the best month of my life,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.160
because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
It was a wonderful experience.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
about radical honesty.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
And this is a movement where --

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160
this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
who says that you should never, ever lie,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
should come out of your mouth.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
So, I decided I would try this for a month.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
This was the worst month of my life.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
(Laughter)

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
I do not recommend this at all.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
To give you a sense of the experience,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
(Laughter)

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.160
So, that was hard.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160
or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
(Laughter)

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
But I love that one,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
because that was an experiment about how much information

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
one human brain could absorb.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
You can just Google it.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
So, I wasted some time there.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
I love those experiments,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
but I think that the most profound

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
and life-changing experiment that I've done

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
"The Year of Living Biblically."

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
And I undertook this for two reasons.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
(Laughter)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
So, not very.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
But I've become increasingly interested in religion.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
I do think it's the defining issue of our time,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
or one of the main ones.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
The second reason I undertook this is because

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
religious fundamentalism, and people who say

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
and take everything in the Bible literally,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
without picking and choosing.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
I had Christian bibles.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
I had Jewish bibles.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
Then I went down and I read several versions,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
and I wrote down every single law that I could find.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
So I wanted to follow those.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
And actually, I take my projects very seriously,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
because I had twins during my year,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
so I definitely take my projects seriously.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
There is the law in Leviticus,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
I didn't know where my corners were,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
so I decided to let the whole thing grow,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
and this is what I looked like by the end.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
(Laughter)

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
So, certainly the challenge was there.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
You only know if you try it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.160
and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
then her hand shall be cut off.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
So, I wanted to follow that rule.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
(Laughter)

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
That one I followed by default,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
looking like she had a strong grip.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
(Laughter)

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
I will say it was an amazing year

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
You know, I could spend a year not killing,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.160
but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160
so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
because I couldn't believe how much

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
my behavior changed my thoughts.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
This was one of the huge lessons of the year,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
is that I almost pretended to be a better person,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
and I became a little bit of a better person.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.160
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.160
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
you visit sick people in the hospital,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
and you will become more compassionate.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
You donate money to a cause,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
and you become emotionally involved in that cause.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
So, it really was cognitive psychology --

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
very primitive cognitive psychology.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
which, as we know, is actually true.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
was the rules that will get you into a little trouble

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
in twenty-first-century America.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.160
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160
(Laughter)

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
But it's a big part of the Bible,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
so I figured I had to address it.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
So, I was able to stone one adulterer.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.160
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
so sandals and sort of a white robe,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And this man came up to me and he said,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
"Why are you dressed like that?"

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
And I explained my project,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
And I said, "Well, that would be great!"

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
(Laughter)

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.160
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
that I had been carrying around for weeks,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
but he grabbed them out of my hand.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
He grabbed them out of my hand

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.160
to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
and yet so incredibly wise in others?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
How should we view the Bible?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
Should we view it, you know, as original intent,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
How was the Bible written?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
And actually, since this is a tech crowd,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
over hundreds of years.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And it's sort of evolved.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
So I thought I would end by telling you

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
that I learned from my year.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
This became very, very clear, early on.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160
(Laughter)

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
during certain times of the month, and more than that,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
And my wife thought this was very offensive,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
so she sat in every seat in our apartment,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
and I had to spend much of the year standing

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.160
until I bought my own seat and carried it around.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
So, you know, I met with creationists.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
I went to the creationists' museum.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
And these are the ultimate literalists.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
It's just that their faith is so strong

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
in this literal interpretation of the Bible

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
that they distort all the data to fit their model.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
They really did a fantastic job.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
If you're ever in Kentucky,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
there's, you can see a movie of the flood,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
and they have sprinklers in the ceiling

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
they did a great job.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
(Laughter)

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
and I started to change my perspective.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
that go right every day, that I didn't even notice,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
on the three or four that went wrong.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
is to just remember when I came over here,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.160
the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
It's a remarkable thing.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
Third, that thou shall have reverence.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
This one was unexpected because I started the year

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
as an agnostic, and by the end of the year,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160
I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
And I'm trying to start it as a movement.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
So, if anyone wants to join,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.160
there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
and that our rituals can be sacred.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
The Sabbath can be sacred.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
because I am a workaholic, so having this one day

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
Thou shall not stereotype.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
This one happened because

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
I spent a lot of time with various religious communities

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
throughout America because I wanted it to be more

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
than about my journey.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
I wanted it to be about religion in America.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
I'm very proud because

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
I think I'm the only person in America

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160
(Laughter)

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
he's like, "I gotta go."

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
(Laughter)

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
Oh, thank you very much.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
Thank you. Bless you, bless you.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
But it was interesting

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.160
evangelical Christianity, and I found that

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
it's such a wide and varied movement

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.160
that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and they focus on the red words in the Bible,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
which are the ones that Jesus spoke.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
They have a pamphlet that says,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.160
So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
helping poor people.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
So, this was very inspiring to me.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
with much of what they say.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
This one was very unexpected because, you know,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
I grew up with the scientific worldview,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.160
and I was shocked learning how much of my life

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
is governed by irrational forces.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
And the thing is, if they're not harmful,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
they're not to be completely dismissed.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.160
"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
And they said, "We don't know,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
but it's just rituals that give us meaning."

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
And I would say, "But that's crazy."

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And they would say, "Well, what about you?

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
blowing out the fire on top of a cake

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.160
versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.160
would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
but that guy's crazy?'"

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.160
So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
So the key is to choose the right rituals,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.160
the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
are not to be dismissed.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
And this one I learned because

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
I tried to follow everything in the Bible.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
And I failed miserably.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
Because you can't.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
is going to be picking and choosing.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.160
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.160
and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
You're just picking and choosing."

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.160
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
I've had some great meals at cafeterias.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.160
as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
or intolerance, or violence,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
which are very much in the Bible as well.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
So if we are to find any meaning in this book,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
There's me reading the Bible.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
That's how I hailed taxicabs.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160
(Laughter)

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Seriously, and it worked. And yes,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
that was actually a rented sheep,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.160
so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
