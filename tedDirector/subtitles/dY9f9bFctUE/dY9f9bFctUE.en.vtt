00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.620
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people
experience armed conflict.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.396
In response, people are forced
to flee their country,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.540
leaving over 15 million refugees.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.676
Children, without a doubt,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.180
are the most innocent
and vulnerable victims ...

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.076
but not just from
the obvious physical dangers,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
but from the often unspoken effects
that wars have on their families.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.316
The experiences of war
leave children at a real high risk

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.259
for the development
of emotional and behavioral problems.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.636
Children, as we can only imagine,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.740
will feel worried, threatened and at risk.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.580
But there is good news.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.956
The quality of care
that children receive in their families

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.436
can have a more significant
effect on their well-being

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.140
than from the actual experiences of war
that they have been exposed to.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.996
So actually, children can be protected

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
by warm, secure parenting
during and after conflict.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.076
In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300
in the University of Manchester
School of Psychological Sciences.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.316
Like many of you here,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
I watched the crisis in Syria
unfold in front of me on the TV.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.676
My family is originally from Syria,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.956
and very early on,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.660
I lost several family members
in really horrifying ways.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.260
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family
and watch the TV.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.436
We've all seen those scenes:

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.516
bombs destroying buildings,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.980
chaos, destruction

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.432
and people screaming and running.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.196
It was always the people screaming
and running that really got me the most,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.460
especially those
terrified-looking children.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.916
I was a mother to two young,
typically inquisitive children.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.516
They were five and six then,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.596
at an age where they typically
asked lots and lots of questions,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.740
and expected real, convincing answers.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.596
So, I began to wonder
what it might be like

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.020
to parent my children
in a war zone and a refugee camp.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.380
Would my children change?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.700
Would my daughter's bright,
happy eyes lose their shine?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.340
Would my son's really relaxed and carefree
nature become fearful and withdrawn?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.860
How would I cope?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.460
Would I change?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.676
As psychologists and parent trainers,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.596
we know that arming parents
with skills in caring for their children

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.180
can have a huge effect
on their well-being,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.900
and we call this parent training.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.436
The question I had was,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.196
could parent training programs
be useful for families

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.236
while they were still in war zones
or refugee camps?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.836
Could we reach them
with advice or training

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.980
that would help them
through these struggles?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.396
So I approached my PhD supervisor,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.916
Professor Rachel Calam,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.220
with the idea of using my academic skills
to make some change in the real world.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.819
I wasn't quite sure
what exactly I wanted to do.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.716
She listened carefully and patiently,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.316
and then to my joy she said,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.196
"If that's what you want to do,
and it means so much to you,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.476
then let's do it.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.476
Let's find ways to see if parent programs

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.860
can be useful for families
in these contexts."

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.676
So for the past five years,
myself and my colleagues --

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.276
Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright --

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.516
have been working
on ways to support families

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.740
that have experienced
war and displacement.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.796
Now, to know how to help families
that have been through conflict

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.236
support their children,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.076
the first step must obviously be
to ask them what they're struggling with,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.316
right?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.716
I mean, it seems obvious.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.116
But it's often those
that are the most vulnerable,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.556
that we're trying to support,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.916
that we actually don't ask.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.116
How many times have we just assumed
we know exactly the right thing

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.780
that's going to help someone or something
without actually asking them first?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.876
So I travelled to refugee camps
in Syria and in Turkey,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.260
and I sat with families, and I listened.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.796
I listened to their parenting challenges,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.076
I listened to their parenting struggles

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.316
and I listened to their call for help.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.356
And sometimes that was just paused,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.436
as all I could do was hold hands with them

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.660
and just join them
in silent crying and prayer.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.836
They told me about their struggles,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.636
they told me about the rough,
harsh refugee camp conditions

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.875
that made it hard to focus
on anything but practical chores

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.700
like collecting clean water.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.980
They told me how they watched
their children withdraw;

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.916
the sadness, depression, anger,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.116
bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,
fear of loud noises,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.996
fear of nightmares --

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.740
terrifying, terrifying nightmares.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.460
These families had been through
what we had been watching on the TV.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.276
The mothers --

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.476
almost half of them
were now widows of war,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.276
or didn't even know
if their husbands were dead or alive --

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.980
described how they felt
they were coping so badly.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.356
They watched their children change
and they had no idea how to help them.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.340
They didn't know how to answer
their children's questions.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.596
What I found incredibly astonishing
and so motivational

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.516
was that these families were
so motivated to support their children.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.956
Despite all these challenges they faced,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.236
they were trying to help their children.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.876
They were making attempts
at seeking support from NGO workers,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.796
from refugee camp teachers,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.036
professional medics,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.260
other parents.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.076
One mother I met had only been
in a camp for four days,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.716
and had already made two attempts

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.156
at seeking support
for her eight-year-old daughter

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.220
who was having terrifying nightmares.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.740
But sadly, these attempts
are almost always useless.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.556
Refugee camp doctors, when available,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.356
are almost always too busy,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.460
or don't have the knowledge or the time
for basic parenting supports.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.300
Refugee camp teachers and other parents
are just like them --

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.420
part of a new refugee community
who's struggling with new needs.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.020
So then we began to think.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.940
How could we help these families?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.196
The families were struggling with things
much bigger than they could cope with.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.916
The Syrian crisis made it clear

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.236
how incredibly impossible it would be
to reach families on an individual level.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.236
How else could we help them?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.196
How would we reach families
at a population level

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.780
and low costs

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.660
in these terrifying, terrifying times?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.276
After hours of speaking to NGO workers,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.756
one suggested a fantastic innovative idea

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.796
of distributing parenting
information leaflets via bread wrappers --

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.156
bread wrappers that were being delivered
to families in a conflict zone in Syria

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.820
by humanitarian workers.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.796
So that's what we did.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.796
The bread wrappers haven't changed
at all in their appearance,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.020
except for the addition
of two pieces of paper.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.516
One was a parenting information leaflet
that had basic advice and information

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.956
that normalized to the parent
what they might be experiencing,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.996
and what their child
might be experiencing.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.836
And information on how they could
support themselves and their children,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.076
such as information like spending
time talking to your child,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.196
showing them more affection,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.276
being more patient with your child,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.116
talking to your children.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.716
The other piece of paper
was a feedback questionnaire,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.340
and of course, there was a pen.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.476
So is this simply leaflet distribution,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.316
or is this actually a possible means
of delivering psychological first aid

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.396
that provides warm,
secure, loving parenting?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.500
We managed to distribute
3,000 of these in just one week.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.636
What was incredible was
we had a 60 percent response rate.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.876
60 percent of the 3,000
families responded.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.396
I don't know how many
researchers we have here today,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.756
but that kind of response
rate is fantastic.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.036
To have that in Manchester
would be a huge achievement,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.756
let alone in a conflict zone in Syria --

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.500
really highlighting how important
these kinds of messages were to families.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.956
I remember how excited and eager we were
for the return of the questionnaires.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.476
The families had left
hundreds of messages --

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.876
most incredibly positive and encouraging.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.636
But my favorite has got to be,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.660
"Thank you for not forgetting
about us and our children."

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.156
This really illustrates
the potential means

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.956
of the delivery of psychological
first aid to families,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.076
and the return of feedback, too.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.596
Just imagine replicating this
using other means

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.196
such as baby milk distribution,
or female hygiene kits,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.500
or even food baskets.

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.556
But let's bring this closer to home,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.876
because the refugee crisis

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.316
is one that is having an effect
on every single one of us.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.955
We're bombarded with images daily
of statistics and of photos,

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.556
and that's not surprising,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.835
because by last month,

00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:56.956
over one million refugees
had reached Europe.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.180
One million.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.916
Refugees are joining our communities,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.436
they're becoming our neighbors,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.940
their children are attending
our children's schools.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.660
So we've adapted the leaflet
to meet the needs of European refugees,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.756
and we have them online, open-access,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.436
in areas with a really high
refugee influx.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.676
For example, the Swedish healthcare
uploaded it onto their website,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.396
and within the first 45 minutes,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.620
it was downloaded 343 times --

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.196
really highlighting how important it is

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.756
for volunteers, practitioners
and other parents

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.700
to have open-access,
psychological first-aid messages.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:41.276
In 2013, I was sitting on the cold,
hard floor of a refugee camp tent

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.380
with mothers sitting around me
as I was conducting a focus group.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.556
Across from me stood an elderly lady

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.036
with what seemed to be
a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.340
with her head on the elderly lady's knees.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.676
The girl stayed quiet
throughout the focus group,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.996
not talking at all,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.140
with her knees
curled up against her chest.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.556
Towards the end of the focus group,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.556
and as I was thanking
the mothers for their time,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.556
the elderly lady looked at me
while pointing at the young girl,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.980
and said to me, "Can you help us with...?"

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.276
Not quite sure what she expected me to do,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.156
I looked at the young girl and smiled,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.556
and in Arabic I said,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.596
"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.820
"What's your name?"

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.276
She looked at me really
confused and unengaged,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.900
but then said, "Halul."

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.196
Halul is the pet's name
for the Arabic female name, Hala,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.100
and is only really used
to refer to really young girls.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.780
At that point I realized that actually
Hala was probably much older than 13.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.900
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old
mother to three young children.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.716
Hala had been a confident,
bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.956
to her children,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.940
but the war had changed all of that.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.196
She had lived through bombs
being dropped in her town;

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.660
she had lived through explosions.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.716
When fighter jets
were flying around their building,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.956
dropping bombs,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.716
her children would be screaming,
terrified from the noise.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.836
Hala would frantically grab pillows
and cover her children's ears

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.236
to block out the noise,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.820
all the while screaming herself.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.596
When they reached the refugee camp

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.836
and she knew they were finally
in some kind of safety,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.260
she completely withdrew
to acting like her old childhood self.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.980
She completely rejected her family --

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.260
her children, her husband.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.140
Hala simply could no longer cope.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.316
This is a parenting struggle
with a really tough ending,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.156
but sadly, it's not uncommon.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.156
Those who experience
armed conflict and displacement

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.780
will face serious emotional struggles.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.580
And that's something we can all relate to.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.740
If you have been through
a devastating time in your life,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.060
if you have lost someone
or something you really care about,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.300
how would you continue to cope?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.620
Could you still be able
to care for yourself and for your family?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.436
Given that the first years
of a child's life are crucial

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.716
for healthy physical
and emotional development,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.716
and that 1.5 billion people
are experiencing armed conflict --

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.436
many of whom are now
joining our communities --

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.356
we cannot afford to turn a blind eye

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.100
to the needs of those
who are experiencing war and displacement.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.076
We must prioritize
these families' needs --

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.940
both those who are internally displaced,
and those who are refugees worldwide.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.916
These needs must be prioritized
by NGO workers, policy makers,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.236
the WHO, the UNHCR
and every single one of us

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.660
in whatever capacity it is
that we function in our society.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.596
When we begin to recognize
the individual faces of the conflict,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.116
when we begin to notice
those intricate emotions on their faces,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.020
we begin to see them as humans, too.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.516
We begin to see
the needs of these families,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.220
and these are the real human needs.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.356
When these family needs are prioritized,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.676
interventions for children
in humanitarian settings

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.980
will prioritize and recognize the primary
role of the family in supporting children.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.236
Family mental health
will be shouting loud and clear

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.020
in global, international agenda.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.596
And children will be less likely
to enter social service systems

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.196
in resettlement countries

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.900
because their families
would have had support earlier on.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.076
And we will be more open-minded,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.916
more welcoming, more caring

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.420
and more trusting to those
who are joining our communities.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.820
We need to stop wars.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.196
We need to build a world where children
can dream of planes dropping gifts,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.460
and not bombs.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.196
Until we stop armed conflicts
raging throughout the world,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.916
families will continue to be displaced,

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.300
leaving children vulnerable.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.956
But by improving parenting
and caregiver support,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.236
it may be possible to weaken the links
between war and psychological difficulties

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.180
in children and their families.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.876
Thank you.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.780
(Applause)
