00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
Over the last 13 years --

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
one, three, 13 years --

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
and partners around the world

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
for taking this idea, this concept,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
noninvasive surgery,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
from the research lab to routine clinical use.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And this is what I'll tell you about.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
13 years --

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
for some of you, you can empathize with that number.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
For me, today, on this date,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
it's like a second bar mitzvah experience.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
(Laughter)

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
So this dream

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
is really enabled

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
by the convergence

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
of two known technologies.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
One is the focused ultrasound,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
and the other one is the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
And I hold in my hand

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
a tissue-mimicking phantom.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
It is made out of silicon.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
It is transparent, made just for you.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
So you see, it's all intact,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
completely transparent.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
I'll take you now to the acoustic lab.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
You see the phantom within the aquarium.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
This is a setup I put in a physics lab.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
On the right-hand side,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
you see an ultrasonic transducer.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
So the ultrasonic transducer

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
emits basically an ultrasonic beam

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
that focuses inside the phantom.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.330
Okay, when you hear the click,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
this is when the energy starts to emit

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and you see a little lesion form

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
inside the phantom.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
Okay, so everything around it

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
is whole and intact.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
It's just a lesion formed inside.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
So think about, this is in your brain.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
We need to reach a target inside the brain.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
We can do it without harming any tissue.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
So this is, I think,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
(Laughter)

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
the force of ultrasound.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And you know also about lithotripsy --

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
breaking kidney stones.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
But ultrasound can be shaped

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
to be anything in between,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
because it's a mechanical force.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Basically, it's a force acting on a tissue

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
that it transverses.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
So you can change the intensity, the frequency,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
the duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
to create anything

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
from an airbrush to a hammer.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
And I am going to show you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
multiple applications in the medical field

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
that can be enabled

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
just by focusing,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
physically focusing.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
So this idea

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
is not new at all.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
When I was born, this idea was already conceived

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
by pioneers such as the Fry brothers

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
and Lars Leksell,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
who is know actually

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
as the inventor of the gammaknife.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
But you may not know

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
noninvasively,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
with focused ultrasound in the '50s.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
He failed,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
so he then invented the gammaknife.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
And it makes you ponder

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
why those pioneers failed.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
And there was something fundamental

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
that they were missing.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
They were missing the vision.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
It wasn't until the invention of the MR

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
and really the integration of MR

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
with focused ultrasound

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
that we could get the feedback --

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
both the anatomical and the physiological

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.330
in order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
surgical procedure.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
So this is how it looks, you know,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
the operating room of the future today.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And I will give you several examples.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
So the first one is in the brain.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
One of the neurological conditions

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that can be treated with focused ultrasound

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
are movement disorders,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
like Parkinson's or essential tremor.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
What is typical to those conditions,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
to essential tremor for example,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
is inability

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
to drink or eat cereal or soup

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
without spilling everything all over you,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
or write legibly so people can understand it,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
and be really independent in your life

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
without the help of others.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
So I'd like you to meet John.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
John is a retired professor of history

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
from Virginia.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And medication didn't help him anymore.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
to have people cut into their brain.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
And about four or five months ago,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.330
he underwent an experimental procedure.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
It is approved under an FDAIDE

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
at the University of Virginia

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
in Charlottesville

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
using focused ultrasound

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
to ablate a point in his thalamus.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And this is his handwriting.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
"On June 20th," if you can read it,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
"2011."

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
This is his handwriting

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
on the morning of the treatment

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
before going into the MR

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
So now I'll take you through

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
So we put the patient on the MR table.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
but if it will be a different organ,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And the physician

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
will then take a regular MR scan.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
And the objective of that?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
I don't have a pointer here,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.330
but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
This is the sort of general area of the treatment.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
It's a safety boundary

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
around the target.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
It's a target in the thalamus.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
So once those pictures are acquired

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
and the physician has drawn

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
all the necessary safety limits and so on,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
he selects basically a point --

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is --

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and he presses this blue button called "sonicate."

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
We call this instance of injecting the energy,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
we call it sonication.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
The only handwork the physician does here

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
is moving a mouse.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
This is the only device he needs in this treatment.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
So he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
You see the transducer, the light blue.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
There's water in between the skull and the transducer.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
And it does this burst of energy.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
It elevates the temperature.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
We first need to verify

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
that we are on target.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
So the first sonication

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
is at lower energy.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
It doesn't do any damage,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
but it elevates the temperature

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
by a few degrees.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And one of the unique capabilities

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
that we leverage with the MR

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.330
is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
This is really a unique capability of the MR.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
It is not being used

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
in regular diagnostic imaging.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
But here we can get

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
And you can see the points there on the graph.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
The temperature was raised

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
to 43 degrees C temporarily.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
This doesn't cause any damage.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
But the point is we are right on target.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
So once the physician verifies

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
then we move to perform

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
a full-energy ablation

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
like you see here.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
And you see the temperature rises

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
to like 55 to 60 degrees C.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
If you do it for more than a second,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
it's enough to basically destroy

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
the proteins of the cells.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
This is the outcome from a patient perspective --

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
same day after the treatment.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
This is an immediate relief.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.330
(Applause)

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
Thank you.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
John is one of [about] a dozen

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
very heroic, courageous people

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
who volunteered for the study.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And you have to understand

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
what is in people's mind

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
when they are willing to take the risk.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
He said, "Miraculous."

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.330
And his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life."

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
And you wonder why.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
I mean, one of the messages I like to carry over

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
is, what about defending quality of life?

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I mean, those people lose their independence.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
They are dependent on others.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
And John today is fully independent.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
He returned to a normal life routine.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
And he also plays golf,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
like you do in Virginia

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.330
when you are retired.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Okay, so you can see here the spot.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
There's no damage outside.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
He suffers from no neurodeficit.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
There's no recovery needed, no nothing.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
He's back to his normal life.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
Let's move now

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
to a more painful subject.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
Pain is something

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
that can make your life miserable.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
like neuropathic pain, lower-back pain

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
and cancer pain from bone metastases,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
when the metastases get to your bones,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
sometimes they are very painful.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
All those I've indicated

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
have already been shown

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
to be successfully treated

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
by focused ultrasound

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
relieving the pain, again, very fast.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
And I would like to tell you

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
about PJ.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
He's a 78 year-old farmer

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
who suffered from -- how should I say it? --

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
it's called pain in the butt.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
He had metastases in his right buttock,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
and he couldn't sit

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
even with medication.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
He had to forgo all the farm activities.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
He was treated with radiation therapy,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
state-of-the-art radiation therapy,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
but it didn't help.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
And again, he volunteered

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
to a pivotal study

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
that we ran worldwide,

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
also in the U.S.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
And his wife actually took him.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
They drove like three hours

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
from their farm to the hospital.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
He had to sit on a cushion,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
stand still, not move,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
because it was very painful.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
He took the treatment,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
and on the way back,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.330
he drove the truck by himself.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
So again, this is an immediate relief.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
And you have to understand

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
what those people feel

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
and what their family experiences

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
when it happens.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
He returned again

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
to his daily routine on the farm.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
He rides his tractor.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.330
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
And he has been very happy.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
But now, you ask me,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
but what about war, the war on cancer?

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Show us some primary cancer.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
What can be done there?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
So I have good news and bad news.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
The good news: there's a lot that can be done.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
And doing that in the U.S.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
is very painful.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.330
I don't see, without this nation

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
taking it as some collective will

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
or something that is a national goal to make that happen,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
it will not happen.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
And it's not just because of regulation;

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
it's because of the amount of money needed

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.330
under the current evidence-based medicine

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
and the size of trials and so on

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
to make it happen.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
So the first two applications

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
are breast cancer and prostate cancer.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:01.330
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
But I have a message for the men here.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
We heard here yesterday Quyen

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
talking about the adverse event trait

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
in prostate cancer.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
There is a unique opportunity now

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
with focused ultrasound guided by MR,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
because we can actually think about

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
prostate lumpectomy --

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
treating just the focal lesion

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
and not removing the whole gland,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
and by that, avoiding all the issues

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
with potency and incontinence.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:38.330
Well, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen --

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
quite lethal, very lethal actually --

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
pancreas, liver, kidney.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
The challenge there

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
with a breathing and awake patient --

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
and in all our treatments,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
the patient is awake and conscious

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and speaks with the physician --

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
is you have to teach the MR some tricks

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
how to do it in real time.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
And this will take time.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
This will take two years.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
But I have now a message to the ladies.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
And this is, in 2004,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.330
for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Women suffer from that disease.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
All those tumors

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
have heavy bleeding during periods,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
abdominal pressure, back pain,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
frequent urination.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.330
And sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
because of the fibroid.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
This is Frances.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
This is a big fibroid.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
She was offered a hysterectomy,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
but this is an inconceivable proposition

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.330
for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.330
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
in 2008.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.330
And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
So new life was born.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
(Applause)

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
So in conclusion,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
I'd like to leave you with actually four messages.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
One is, think about the amount

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
of suffering that is saved

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.330
from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
and also the economical and emotional burden

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
removed from their families and communities

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.330
and the society at large --

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:36.330
and I think also from their physicians, by the way.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
And the other thing I would like you to think about

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
is the new type of relationship

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
between physician and patients

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
when you have a patient on the table

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
In all our treatments,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
the patient holds a stop sonication button.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.330
He can stop the surgery at any moment.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
And with that note,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
I would like to thank you for listening.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
(Applause)
