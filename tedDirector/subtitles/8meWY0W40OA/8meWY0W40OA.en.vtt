00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
about the future,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and where we might move forward from this point.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
Some of those stories are that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
But I want to tell you a different story here today.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Like all stories, it has a beginning.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
in teaching people practical skills

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
for sustainability,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
teaching people how to take responsibility

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
for growing some of their own food,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
how to build buildings using local materials,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
how to generate their own energy, and so on.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.330
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
But all my work for many years was focused

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
around the idea that sustainability

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
means basically looking at

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
the globalized economic growth model,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
and moderating what comes in at one end,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and moderating the outputs at the other end.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
which actually changed that profoundly.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
And in order to introduce you to that,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I've got something here that I'm going to unveil,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
that I think maybe as I remove this cloth

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.330
(Laughter)

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
This is a liter of oil.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
This bottle of oil,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
ancient sunlight,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
hard human manual labor --

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.330
equivalent to about 35 strong people

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
coming round and working for you.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
medicine, modern clothing,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
laptops, a whole range of different things.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
We've based the design of our settlements,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
our business models, our transport plans,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Yet, when we take a step back,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and look over the span of history,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
at what we might call the petroleum interval,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
it's a short period in history

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
where we've discovered this extraordinary material,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and then based a whole way of life around it.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.330
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
we move from a time where our economic success,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
our sense of individual prowess and well-being

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
is directly linked to how much of this we consume,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
is our degree of vulnerability.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
And it's increasingly clear that we

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
we're going to have this at our disposal forever.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
For every four barrels of oil that we consume,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
we only discover one.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
And that gap continues to widen.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
There is also the fact that the amount of energy

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
for every one that we put in to extract it.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
Completely unprecedented, historically.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
Already that's fallen to about 11.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And that's why, now,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
or at the bottom of the oceans.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
The moment when the world on average passes this peak,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
people wonder when that's going to happen.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.330
And there is an emerging case

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
that maybe that was what happened last July

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
when the oil prices were so high.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
But are we to assume that the same brilliance

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
and creativity and adaptability

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
has to be based on a realistic assessment

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
of where we are.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
There is also the issue of climate change,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
as the data that's coming in,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.330
which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
So the IPCC said

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
that we might see significant breakup

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
Actually, if current trends continue,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
is released as the world warms,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
it would offset all the savings that we need to make,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.330
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
But I'm always very interested to think about

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
what might the stories be

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
that the generations further down the slope from us

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
are going to tell about us.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.330
that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
And one of the ways I like to do that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
is to look back at the stories people used to tell

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
a kind of travel completely unimaginable

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
this pot would just make as much food as you liked,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
without you having to do any work,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
and all the shoes are magically made for them.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
Now we have the seven-league boots

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
We have the magic porridge pot

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
in the form of Walmart and Tesco.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
And we have the elves in the form of China.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.330
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
thing that has been.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
as we look forward about where we're going to go.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
that the future will be like the present, just more of it.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
that is increasingly coming into question.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
And in terms of climate change,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
is something that is not actually feasible.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
There is the idea of hitting the wall,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
that actually somehow everything is so fragile

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
that it might just all unravel and collapse.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
This is a popular story in some places.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
that technology can somehow get us through this completely.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.330
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
economic and energy crisis,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
that a move to a knowledge economy

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
that will mean we can sweep all concerns

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
about energy security to one side,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
the idea that we can step off neatly

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
onto a completely renewable world.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
But the world isn't Second Life.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
there are still people mining coal

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
to make all of those things.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
to check our email in the morning

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
is still transported at great distances,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
usually at the expense of the local, more resilient

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
food systems that would have supplied that in the past,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.330
which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Energy and technology are not the same thing.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
What I'm involved with is the transition response.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And this is really about looking the challenges

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
of peak oil and climate change square in the face,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
and responding with a creativity and an adaptability

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
and an imagination that we really need.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And it is something which has several characteristics.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.330
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.330
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
develops and passes on as they work with it.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
that pushes this; people just pick up an idea

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
where they are, to respond to this.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
It's sensitive to place and to scale.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Transitional is completely different.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
It learns very much from its mistakes.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
that this is a historic opportunity

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
to do something really extraordinary.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
And it's a process which is really joyful.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
People have a huge amount of fun doing this,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
reconnecting with other people as they do it.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
And it's really about how systems,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
settlements, withstand shock from the outside.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
When they encounter shock from the outside

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.330
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
the energy efficiency of the freezers

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Looking through the lens of resilience,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
that's so vulnerable.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
Resilience runs much deeper:

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
it's about building modularity into what we do,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.330
building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
This is at a time when the city of Bristol,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
which is quite close to here,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
was surrounded by commercial market gardens,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
which provided a significant amount of the food

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.330
that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
which we can now only look back on with envy.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
So how does this transition idea work?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
They start to run an awareness-raising program

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
looking at how this might actually work in the town.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
They show films, they give talks, and so on.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It's a process which is playful and creative

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
and informative.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
which then the transition project itself

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
starts to support and enable.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
where I was teaching, and has since spread.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.330
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
but what do they actually do on the ground?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.330
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
We need national responses. We need local government responses.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
But all of those things are going to be much easier

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
over the next 5 to 10 years.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
like community-supported agriculture schemes,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.330
urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
community-owned energy companies,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
where the community can invest money into itself,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
to start putting in place

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
A lot of places are working with their local schools.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
the kids are learning how to grow food.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
that matches up people who don't have a garden

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
And also starting to play around with the idea of

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
alternative currencies.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
This is Lewes in Sussex,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
who have recently launched the Lewes Pound,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
a currency that you can only spend within the town,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
But actually within the town you start to create these economic

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
cycles much more effectively.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
still start by assuming that there will be more energy,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
more cars, more housing,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
more jobs, more growth, and so on.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
and actually come up with something that was actually more likely

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
to sustain everybody?

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.330
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
From three years ago, it just being an idea,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
this has become something that has virally swept around the world.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
as a keynote listener.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
Which he did --

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.330
(Laughter)

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
(Applause) --

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
There are now two local authorities in this country

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:21.330
the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
And the head of the council said,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.330
all of that community infrastructure for the first time."

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
has funded Transition Scotland

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
as a national organization supporting the spread of this.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
And we see it all over the place as well now.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
but that things are already inevitably changing,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
and what we need to do is to work creatively with that,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
based on asking the right questions.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
I think I'd like to just return at the end

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
to the idea of stories.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Because I think stories are vital here.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.330
we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
And one of the key things that transition does

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
Stories about the community that's produced

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
its own 21 pound note, for example,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
the school that's turned its car park into a food garden,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
the community that's founded its own energy company.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
And for me, one of the great stories recently

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.330
was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.330
it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.330
is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
in order to thrive,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
how can it be done in such a way

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
that drastically reduces its carbon emissions,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
while also building resilience?

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
Personally, I feel enormously grateful

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
to have lived through the age of cheap oil.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
But let us honor what it has bought us,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
and move forward from this point.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
that it can underpin our choices,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.330
and that the Oil Age has done for us,

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
we are able to then begin the creation

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.330
of a world which is more resilient,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
more nourishing,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
and more connected to each other.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
Thank you very much.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.330
(Applause)
