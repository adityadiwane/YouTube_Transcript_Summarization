00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
sharing some of the problems.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and making it kind of an annual thing.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
because I think there are some very important problems

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
that don't get worked on naturally.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
to do the right things.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
And only by paying attention to these things

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
can we make as much progress as we need to.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and talk about where they stand.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
is to look at childhood deaths.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.160
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
It's a phenomenal thing.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Each one of those lives matters a lot.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
but also a few key breakthroughs:

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
vaccines that were used more widely.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
For example, measles was four million of the deaths

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
back as recently as 1990

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and now is under 400,000.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So we really can make changes.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Why? Well there's only a few diseases

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.160
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.160
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.160
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Well, what's the history of this disease?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
it's the only disease we can see

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
that people who lived in Africa

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.160
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
So it was absolutely gigantic.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And the disease was all over the world.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
So it was everywhere.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.160
And so that's why the death rate did come down.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
Now, ironically, what happened was

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160
which is where the rich countries are.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
1945, it's still most places.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.160
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And so this leads to the paradox that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
it doesn't get much investment.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
than are put into malaria.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
(Laughter)

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And rich men are afflicted.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
And so that's why that priority has been set.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
But, malaria --

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
greatly understate its impact.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
because it just holds things back so much.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
(Laughter)

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.160
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Those mosquitos are not infected.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.160
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
And bed nets are a great tool.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160
and those nets

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
And that's happened now in a number of countries.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
It's great to see.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
But we have to be careful because malaria --

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And so you end up with two choices.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
you do it vigorously,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
you can actually get a local eradication.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
and the death rate will soar back up again.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
Now we're on the upswing.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Bed net funding is up.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
There's new drug discovery going on.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160
that starts in a couple months.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
So we're going to have these new tools.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Because the road map to get rid of this disease

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
involves many things.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
to keep the visibility high,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
to tell the success stories.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
It involves social scientists,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
but 90 percent.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.160
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.160
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
And so as these elements come together,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
I'm quite optimistic

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Now let me turn to a second question,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.160
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
and we'd understand very well.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
And the answer is, really, that we don't.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Let's start with why this is important.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
We all had a wonderful education.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
That's part of the reason we're here today,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
part of the reason we're successful.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
I had great teachers.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.160
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.160
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
is starting to fade on a relative basis,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.160
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
to people with a better education.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
And we have to change this.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
We have to change it so that the country is strong

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
and stays at the forefront

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
of things that are driven by advanced education,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
like science and mathematics.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
When I first learned the statistics,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And that had been covered up for a long time

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
because they always took the dropout rate as the number

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
They had to raise the stated dropout rate

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
as soon as that tracking was done

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
to over 30 percent.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
And even if you graduate from high school,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
if you're low-income,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.160
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160
If you're low-income in the United States,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
you have a higher chance of going to jail

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
than you do of getting a four-year degree.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
So, how do you make education better?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
There's many people working on it.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
We've worked on small schools,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
we've funded scholarships,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
we've done things in libraries.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
A lot of these things had a good effect.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
was the very key thing.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
And we hooked up with some people studying

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
how much variation is there between teachers,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and the bottom quartile.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
based on test scores --

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
by over 10 percent in a single year.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160
What does that mean?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
had top quartile teachers,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
We should retain those people.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.160
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
What do they look like?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
You might think these must be very senior teachers.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
And the answer is no.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Once somebody has taught for three years

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.160
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
The variation is very, very small.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
You might think these are people with master's degrees.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
This chart takes four different factors

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
is a master's degree.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
One is seniority.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
Teach for America: slight effect.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.160
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
There are some people who are very good at this.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
And we've done almost nothing

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
to study what that is

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
and to draw it in and to replicate it,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
to raise the average capability --

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
And it's a system with very high turnover.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:03.160
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
It's an unbelievable thing.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and what goes on is great teaching.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
They take the poorest kids,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
is very different than in the normal public schools.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
They're taking data, the test scores,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
at first it's very bizarre.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
What's going on?"

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
which kids were bored,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
It was a very dynamic environment,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
keeping people engaged and setting the tone

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.160
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
Everybody needs to be involved.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
And so KIPP is doing it.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
How does that compare to a normal school?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.160
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
The data isn't gathered.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
In the teacher's contract,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.160
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
sometimes to once per year.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
And they need advanced notice to do that.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
some of them just making crap

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.160
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
They don't have the test scores,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
For example, New York passed a law

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.160
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
in the tenure decision for the teachers.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
But I'm optimistic about this,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
I think there are some clear things we can do.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
and that's given us the picture of where we are.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
Of course, digital video is cheap now.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
Putting a few cameras in the classroom

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.160
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
is very practical in all public schools.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.160
You can take those great courses and make them available

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
If you have a kid who's behind,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.160
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.160
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:02.160
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.160
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
we can do it much better.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
the place that this is going on --

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.160
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
And I thought it was so fantastic.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.160
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.160
(Applause)

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
Now, we put a lot of money into education,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.160
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.160
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
and it was taken out in the Senate

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160
because there are people who are threatened by these things.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160
But I -- I'm optimistic.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.160
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:09.160
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
I only had time to frame those two problems.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
There's a lot more problems like that --

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.160
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
just at the very name of these things.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.160
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.160
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160
So it's going to take brilliant people like you

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.160
to study these things, get other people involved --

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160
and you're helping to come up with solutions.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.160
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160
Thank you.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:20:10.160
(Applause)
