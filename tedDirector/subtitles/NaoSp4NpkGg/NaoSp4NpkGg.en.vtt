00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Do you know

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
deployed worldwide?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And these are base stations.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And we also have

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
more than five billion

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
of these devices here.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
These are cellular mobile phones.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And with these mobile phones,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
every month.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
a very large number.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And wireless communications

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
has become a utility

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
like electricity and water.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now --

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in our private lives, in our business lives.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
to switch off the mobile phone at events like this

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
for good reasons.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And it's this importance

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
why I decided to look into the issues

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that this technology has,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
because it's so fundamental to our lives.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And one of the issues is capacity.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
in particular, radio waves.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And radio waves are limited.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
They are scarce; they are expensive;

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and we only have a certain range of it.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And it's this limitation

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that doesn't cope

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
with the demand of wireless data transmissions

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And we are simply running out of spectrum.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
There's another problem.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
That is efficiency.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
consume a lot of energy.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And mind you, most of the energy

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
is not used to transmit the radio waves,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
it is used to cool the base stations.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Then the efficiency of such a base station

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is only at about five percent.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And that creates a big problem.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
You have to switch off your mobile phone

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
during flights.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
In hospitals, they are security issues.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And security is another issue.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
These radio waves penetrate through walls.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
They can be intercepted,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and somebody can make use of your network

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
if he has bad intentions.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
So these are the main four issues.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
But on the other hand,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
we have 14 billion of these:

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
light bulbs, light.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So let's look at this in the context

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Then there's ultraviolet light.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
it's good for a nice suntan,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
but otherwise dangerous for the human body.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Infrared --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
due to eye safety regulations,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
can be only used with low power.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It's light,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and light has been around for many millions of years.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And in fact, it has created us,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
has created life,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
has created all the stuff of life.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So it's inherently safe to use.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I compared the radio waves spectrum --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the size of it --

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
with the size of the visible light spectrum.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And guess what?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
which is there for us to use.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
We have 1.4 million

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
expensively deployed,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
inefficient radio cellular base stations.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And multiply that by 10,000,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
then you end up at 14 billion.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So we have the infrastructure there.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Can we use them for communications?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Yes.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
What do we need to do?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
The one thing we need to do

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
florescent lights,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
with this new technology of LED,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
LED light bulbs.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And it has a very nice acute property.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Its intensity can be modulated

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
at very high speeds,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and it can be switched off at very high speeds.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And this is a fundamental basic property

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that we exploit

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
with our technology.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
So let's show how we do that.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum --

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
go to remote controls.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
in 10,000 bits per second,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
20,000 bits per second.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Not usable for a YouTube video.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
What we have done

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
is we have developed a technology

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
with which we can furthermore

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
replace the remote control of our light bulb.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
We transmit with our technology,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
not only a single data stream,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
we transmit thousands of data streams

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
in parallel,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
at even higher speeds.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And the technology we have developed --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
it's called SIM OFDM.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And it's spacial modulation --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
but this is how we enabled

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
that light source

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
to transmit data.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
You will say, "Okay, this is nice --

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
a slide created in 10 minutes."

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
But not only that.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
What we've done

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
is we have also developed a demonstrator.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And I'm showing for the first time in public

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
this visible light demonstrator.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And what we have here

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
is no ordinary desk lamp.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We fit in an LED light bulb,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
worth three U.S. dollars,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
put in our signal processing technology.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And then what we have here is a little hole.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And the light goes through that hole.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
There's a receiver.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that we create there

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
into an electrical signal.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And that signal is then converted back

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
to a high-speed data stream.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
In the future we hope

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
that we can integrate this little hole

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
into these smart phones.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And not only integrate a photo detector here,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
but maybe use the camera inside.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So what happens

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
when I switch on that light?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
As you would expect,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
it's a light, a desk lamp.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Put your book beneath it and you can read.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
It's illuminating the space.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.260
But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And that's a video, a high-definition video

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that is transmitted through that light beam.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
You're critical.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
You think, "Ha, ha, ha.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
But let me do this.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.260
(Applause)

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Once again.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Still don't believe?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
It is this light

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And if you look at the light,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
it is illuminating as you would expect.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
You don't notice with your human eye.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
that we impress onto this light bulb.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
It's serving the purpose of illumination,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And you see,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
It can ignore that constant light,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
because all the receiver's interested in

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
are subtle changes.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
You also have a critical question now, and

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
you say, "Okay,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
do I have to have the light on all the time

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to have this working?"

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And the answer is yes.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
But, you can dim down the light

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to a level that it appears to be off.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Capacity:

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
We have 10,000 times more spectrum,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
10,000 times more LEDs

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
installed already in the infrastructure there.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
You would agree with me, hopefully,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
there's no issue of capacity anymore.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Efficiency:

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
This is data through illumination --

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
it's first of all an illumination device.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And if you do the energy budget,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
the data transmission comes for free --

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
highly energy efficient.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
I don't mention the high energy efficiency

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of these LED light bulbs.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
If the whole world would deploy them,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
you would save hundreds of power plants.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
That's aside.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And then I've mentioned the availability.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
You need to see what to do.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
You have lights in an aircraft.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
So it's everywhere in a day there is light.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And then there's security.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
You would agree with me

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
that light doesn't penetrate through walls.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So no one, if I have a light here,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
if I have secure data,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
no one on the other side of this room through that wall

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
would be able to read that data.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And there's only data where there is light.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.260
then what I could do,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
turn it away.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
So for me,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
the applications of it,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And you only have to notice, where we have light,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
there is a potential way to transmit data.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But I can give you a few examples.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Well you may see the impact already now.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
This is a remote operated vehicle

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
beneath the ocean.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And they use light to illuminate space down there.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
that these things [use] to communicate with each other.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Intrinsically safe environments

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
like this petrochemical plant --

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
In hospitals,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
for new medical instruments;

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
in streets for traffic control.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and cars can communicate with each other

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and prevent accidents

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in the way that they exchange information.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
And then you have these millions of street lamps

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
deployed around the world.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And every street lamp could be a free access point.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
light-fidelity.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And then we have these aircraft cabins.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
and each of these lights

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
on your long flight back home.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So, all we would need to do

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
is to fit a small microchip

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
to every potential illumination device.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And this would then combine

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
two basic functionalities:

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
illumination and wireless data transmission.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
could solve the four essential problems

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that face us in wireless communication these days.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And in the future,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
you may have 14 billion Li-Fis

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
deployed worldwide --

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
for a cleaner, a greener,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and even a brighter future.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Thank you.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:45.260
(Applause)
