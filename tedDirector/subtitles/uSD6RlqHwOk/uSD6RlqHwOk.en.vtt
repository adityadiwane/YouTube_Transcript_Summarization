00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:16.362
How many times have you used
the word "awesome" today?

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:20.497
Once? Twice? Seventeen times?

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:21.863
Do you remember what you were describing

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:23.213
when you used the word?

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:26.453
No, I didn't think so, because
it's come down to this, people:

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.355
You're using the word incorrectly,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.424
and tonight I hope to show you

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:33.506
how to put the "awe" back in "awesome."

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.330
Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.243
and the server came up to our table,

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:39.790
and asked us if we had dined there before,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.739
and I said, "Yes, yes, we have."

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.519
And she said, "Awesome."

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.754
And I thought, "Really?

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:49.376
Awesome or just merely good

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:54.040
that we decided to visit your restaurant again?"

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.400
The other day, one of my coworkers asked me

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.880
if I could save that file as a PDF,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.621
and I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome."

00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:08.848
Seriously, can saving anything as a PDF

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:11.796
be awesome?

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.956
Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome"

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:19.123
has now replaced words like "great" and "thank you."

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:23.495
So Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome"

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:27.623
as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:31.019
a feeling produced by something majestic.

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:32.943
Now, with that in mind,

00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:36.240
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510
How about that parking space? Was that awesome?

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.056
Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?

00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.440
The answer is no, no and no.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.113
A sandwich can be delicious,

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:47.415
that parking space can be nearby,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:50.155
and that game can be a blowout,

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:54.380
but not everything can be awesome.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.010
(Laughter)

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.659
So when you use the word "awesome"

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.977
to describe the most mundane of things,

00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:03.880
you're taking away the very power of the word.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.298
This author says, "Snowy days

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:10.573
or finding money in your pants is awesome."

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:11.451
(Laughter)

00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.433
Um, no, it is not,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:19.831
and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.
(Laughter)

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.401
So in other words, if you have
everything, you value nothing.

00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:25.771
It's a lot like drinking from a firehose

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:29.719
like this jackass right here.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.138
There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:34.000
if everything is awesome.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.165
Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things

00:02:36.165 --> 00:02:38.083
that are truly awesome.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.766
Imagine, if you will, having to schlep

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.227
everything on your back.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.220
Wouldn't this be easier for me

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.188
if I could roll this home?

00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:48.517
Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:51.389
The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.186
Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:57.809
Yes, the wheel is awesome!

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.870
The Great Pyramids were the tallest

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.488
man-made structure in the world

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.872
for 4,000 years.

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:07.411
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:11.427
just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:12.780
Were the Great Pyramids awesome?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.030
Yes, the pyramids were awesome.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.176
The Grand Canyon. Come on.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.404
It's almost 80 million years old.

00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:22.171
Is the Grand Canyon awesome?

00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:23.712
Yes, the Grand Canyon is.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:28.470
Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.989
and earlier today,

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.954
when you whipped out your smartphone

00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:34.566
and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:36.311
and you know who you are —

00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.527
(Laughter) —

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:40.867
wasn't that easier than exposing the image

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.443
to copper plates coated with iodized silver?

00:03:43.443 --> 00:03:45.515
I mean, come on. Is photography awesome?

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.405
Yes, photography is awesome.

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:49.818
D-Day, June 6, 1944,

00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:52.186
the Allied invasion of Normandy,

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:56.282
the largest amphibious invasion in world history.

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:59.422
Was D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:01.973
Did you eat food today? Did you eat?

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:04.301
Then you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.395
because if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:09.217
and then we're all going to die.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:10.337
It's just like that.

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:12.682
But it's not like a flower can just get up

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:15.154
and have sex with another flower,

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.485
although that would be awesome.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:20.304
(Laughter)

00:04:20.304 --> 00:04:23.242
Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me?

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:27.198
Landing on the moon! Come on!

00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:30.171
Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.995
Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers

00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:35.605
took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,

00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:38.934
Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.

00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:40.959
That's like from here to the moon.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:43.195
(Laughter)

00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:45.549
That's one small step for a man,

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:48.131
one giant leap for awesome!

00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.152
You're damn right, it was.

00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:53.928
Woodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said

00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:57.097
this changed the history of rock and roll.

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.707
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then.

00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:03.339
You can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.459
Jimi Hendrix's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:08.690
was the most iconic.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.238
Was Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:13.987
Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.

00:05:13.987 --> 00:05:16.424
Sharks have multiple rows of teeth

00:05:16.424 --> 00:05:17.669
that grow in their jaw

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.067
and they move forward like a conveyor belt.

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:24.760
Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.357
Does awesome inspire fear?

00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:31.103
Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!

00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:33.930
The Internet was born in 1982

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.695
and it instantly took over global communication,

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:39.798
and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.756
are uplifted to the Internet

00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:44.580
so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.549
and watch this crap,

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:50.303
the Internet is awesome.

00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:52.790
And finally, finally some of you can't wait

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.952
to come up and tell me how
awesome my PowerPoint was.

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.620
I will save you the time.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.282
It was not awesome, but it was true,

00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:02.060
and I hope it was entertaining,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.407
and out of all the audiences I've ever had,

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.107
y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night.

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:12.107
(Applause)
