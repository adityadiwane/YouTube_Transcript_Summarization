00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:17.737
So, I teach college students
about inequality and race in education,

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.826
and I like to leave my office open
to any of my students

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.381
who might just want to see me to chat.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:24.952
And a few semesters ago,

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:27.881
one of my more cheerful
students, Mahari,

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:29.302
actually came to see me

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:33.977
and mentioned that he was feeling
a bit like an outcast because he's black.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.874
He had just transferred to NYU
from a community college

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:38.660
on a merit scholarship,

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.518
and turns out,

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.824
only about five percent
of students at NYU are black.

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:45.277
And so I started to remember

00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:47.830
that I know that feeling
of being an outsider

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:49.534
in your own community.

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.777
It's partially what drew me to my work.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.032
At my university,

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:55.453
I'm one of the few
faculty members of color,

00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:59.302
and growing up, I experienced
my family's social mobility,

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.549
moving out of apartments
into a nice house,

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:04.928
but in an overwhelmingly
white neighborhood.

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:06.443
I was 12,

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:10.419
and kids would say that were surprised
that I didn't smell like curry.

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:11.666
(Laughter)

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.635
That's because school is in the morning,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.531
and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:16.705
(Laughter)

00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:18.413
Curry is for dinner.

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:19.888
(Laughter)

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:21.793
So when Mahari was leaving,

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:24.809
I asked him how he was coping
with feeling isolated.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:27.058
And he said that despite feeling lonely,

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:29.158
he just threw himself at his work,

00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:31.635
that he built strategies around his grit

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.566
and his desire to be successful.

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:36.850
A mentor of mine is actually
Dr. Angela Duckworth,

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:41.741
the psychologist at UPenn who has defined
this stick-to-itiveness of grit

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:45.445
as being "the perseverance
and passion for long-term goals."

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.646
Angela's book has become a bestseller,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.681
and schools across the country,

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:51.420
particularly charter schools,

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.911
have become interested in citing
"grit" as a core value.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.306
But sometimes grit isn't enough,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.230
especially in education.

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:01.122
So when Mahari was leaving my office,

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.824
I worried that he might need
something more specific

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:06.165
to combat the challenges
that he mentioned to me.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.029
As a sociologist,
I also study achievement,

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:12.232
but from a slightly different perspective.

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:15.429
I research students who have overcome
immense obstacles

00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:17.077
related to their background.

00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.733
Students from low-income,

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:20.794
often single-parent households,

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:25.655
students who have been homeless,
incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.108
or some who have struggled
with substance abuse

00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:30.624
or lived through violent or sexual trauma.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.328
So let me tell you about two
of the grittiest people I've met.

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.751
Tyrique was raised by a single mother,

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:40.629
and then after high school,
he fell in with the wrong crowd.

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:42.545
He got arrested for armed robbery.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.027
But in prison, he started to work hard.

00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:46.877
He took college credit courses,

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.547
so when he got out,
he was able to get a master's,

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:51.929
and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.

00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:55.462
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:58.853
from the Lower East Side
to Staten Island to the Bronx.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.848
She was raised primarily
by her extended family,

00:03:01.872 --> 00:03:04.342
because her own mother
had a heroin addiction.

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:05.962
Yet at 15,

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.606
Vanessa had to drop out of school,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.013
and she had a son of her own.

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:12.803
But eventually, she was able
to go to community college,

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:14.322
get her associate's,

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.598
then go to an elite college
to finish her bachelor's.

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.785
So some people might
hear these stories and say,

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.818
"Yes, those two definitely have grit.

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:25.706
They basically pulled themselves up
by the bootstraps."

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.488
But that's an incomplete picture,

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.033
because what's more important

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:34.158
is that they had factors in their lives
that helped to influence their agency,

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:35.858
or their specific capacity

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.446
to actually overcome
the obstacles that they were facing

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.842
and navigate the system
given their circumstances.

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.652
So, allow me to elaborate.

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:48.298
In prison, Tyrique
was actually aimless at first,

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:50.381
as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.219
This is until an older detainee
took him aside

00:03:54.243 --> 00:03:56.784
and asked him to help
with the youth program.

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:58.251
And in mentoring youth,

00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:01.861
he started to see his own mistakes
and possibilities in the teens.

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:05.939
This is what got him interested
in taking college-credit courses.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:07.143
And when he got out,

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.381
he got a job with Fortune Society,

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:13.105
where many executives are people
who have been formerly incarcerated.

00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:16.210
So then he was able to get
a master's in social work,

00:04:16.234 --> 00:04:20.669
and today, he even lectures
at Columbia about prison reform.

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:22.549
And Vanessa ...

00:04:22.573 --> 00:04:24.637
well, after the birth of her son,

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.941
she happened to find a program
called Vocational Foundation

00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:29.981
that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.163
a MetroCard

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.373
and her first experiences with a computer.

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:36.741
These simple resources
are what helped her get her GED,

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:39.620
but then she suffered
from a very serious kidney failure,

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:43.708
which was particularly problematic
because she was only born with one kidney.

00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:47.858
She spent 10 years on dialysis
waiting for a successful transplant.

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:49.728
After that,

00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:52.574
her mentors at community college
had kept in touch with her,

00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:54.235
and so she was able to go,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.358
and they put her in an honors program.

00:04:56.382 --> 00:04:59.123
And that's the pathway
that allowed her to become accepted

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:02.486
to one of the most elite colleges
for women in the country,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.987
and she received her bachelor's at 36,

00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:07.787
setting an incredible example
for her young son.

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:12.971
What these stories primarily indicate
is that teaching is social

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:15.360
and benefits from social scaffolding.

00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.194
There were factors
pushing these two in one direction,

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.067
but through tailored
mentorship and opportunities,

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.615
they were able to reflect
on their circumstances

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.151
and resist negative influences.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.685
They also learned simple skills
like developing a network,

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:31.350
or asking for help --

00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:36.178
things many of us in this room can forget
that we have needed from time to time,

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.699
or can take for granted.

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.083
And when we think of people like this,

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:44.282
we should only think of them
as exceptional, but not as exceptions.

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:47.477
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us

00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.925
of the collective responsibility
to help students in similar situations.

00:05:52.274 --> 00:05:55.878
When Presidents Bush, Obama
and now even Trump,

00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:59.600
have called education
"the civil rights issue of our time,"

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:01.354
perhaps we should treat it that way.

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.831
If schools were able to think
about the agency that their students have

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:08.348
and bring to the table
when they push them,

00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:11.371
what students learn can become
more relevant to their lives,

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:15.966
and then they can tap into those internal
reservoirs of grit and character.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.629
So this here --

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:20.368
My student Mahari

00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:23.617
got accepted to law school
with scholarships,

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:25.157
and not to brag,

00:06:25.181 --> 00:06:27.704
but I did write one of his letters
of recommendation.

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:29.316
(Laughter)

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.298
And even though I know hard work
is what got him this achievement,

00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:35.429
I've seen him find
his voice along the way,

00:06:35.453 --> 00:06:39.294
which as someone who's grown up
a little bit shy and awkward,

00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:41.631
I know it takes time and support.

00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:44.790
So even though
he will rely a lot on his grit

00:06:44.814 --> 00:06:47.989
to get him through
that first-year law school grind,

00:06:48.013 --> 00:06:50.418
I'll be there as a mentor for him,

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:52.474
check in with him from time to time,

00:06:52.498 --> 00:06:54.482
maybe take him out to get some curry ...

00:06:54.506 --> 00:06:55.593
(Laughter)

00:06:55.617 --> 00:06:59.368
so that he can keep growing his agency
to succeed even more.

00:06:59.392 --> 00:07:00.543
Thank you.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:04.201
(Applause)
