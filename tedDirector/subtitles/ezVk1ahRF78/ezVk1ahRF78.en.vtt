Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:19.482
I'm going to talk about religion.

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:24.734
But it's a broad and very delicate subject,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.405
so I have to limit myself.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:28.885
And therefore I will limit myself

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:33.294
to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:34.860
(Laughter)

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.420
This is a very serious talk.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.515
So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:43.860
It's when the young couple whisper,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.032
"Tonight we are going to make a baby."

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:52.368
My talk will be about the impact of religions

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:56.537
on the number of babies per woman.

00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:58.202
This is indeed important,

00:00:58.202 --> 00:00:59.732
because everyone understands

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.014
that there is some sort of limit

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:05.242
on how many people we can be on this planet.

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:07.189
And there are some people

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.608
who say that the world population is growing like this --

00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:12.415
three billion in 1960,

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:15.054
seven billion just last year --

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.600
and it will continue to grow

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.380
because there are religions that stop women from having few babies,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.783
and it may continue like this.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:26.685
To what extent are these people right?

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:31.565
When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:35.740
and today, 2000, there's almost two billion.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.442
What has happened since,

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:40.137
and what do the experts predict will happen

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:42.620
with the number of children during this century?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.238
This is a quiz. What do you think?

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:49.140
Do you think it will decrease to one billion?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.968
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:56.685
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,

00:01:56.685 --> 00:01:59.189
or will it continue in the same fast rate

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.678
and be four billion children up there?

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:05.103
I will tell you by the end of my speech.

00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:10.125
But now, what does religion have to do with it?

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.457
When you want to classify religion,

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:13.988
it's more difficult than you think.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:17.192
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:22.725
It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.497
but that's not detailed enough.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:28.306
So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.952
But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.555
into many subgroups,

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.060
which was too detailed.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.478
Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map,

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:41.851
and it looks like this.

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.254
Each country's a bubble.

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:48.678
The size is the population -- big China, big India here.

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:52.792
And the color now is the majority religion.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:56.023
It's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:57.278
say that they belong.

00:02:57.278 --> 00:03:01.995
It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:03.968
Islam is the majority religion

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:07.743
all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,

00:03:07.743 --> 00:03:10.023
Southern Europe and through Asia

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.260
all the way to Indonesia.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.177
That's where we find Islamic majority.

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:19.980
And Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.005
And that is most countries in America and Europe,

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.675
many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:30.355
The white here are countries which cannot be classified,

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:32.980
because one religion does not reach 50 percent

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.337
or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:38.097
So we were careful with that.

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:41.955
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.968
This is in 1960.

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:47.500
And now I show the number of babies per woman here:

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.586
two, four or six --

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.777
many babies, few babies.

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:55.958
And here the income per person in comparable dollars.

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.555
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:01.225
before you get few babies.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.857
So low income here, high income there.

00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:06.495
And indeed in 1960,

00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:09.232
you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:11.506
The exception was Japan.

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:14.743
Japan here was regarded as an exception.

00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:16.771
Otherwise it was only Christian countries.

00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:18.980
But there was also many Christian countries

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.552
that had six to seven babies per woman.

00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:27.029
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:31.202
And countries with Islam as the majority religion,

00:04:31.202 --> 00:04:35.832
all of them almost had six to seven children per woman,

00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:38.257
irregardless of the income level.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.500
And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.420
Now let's see what has happened in the world.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.340
I start the world, and here we go.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.558
Now 1962 -- can you see they're getting a little richer,

00:04:49.558 --> 00:04:52.232
but the number of babies per woman is falling?

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:54.405
Look at China. They're falling fairly fast.

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:59.168
And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,

00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:04.131
as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:06.660
And when we enter into this century,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.020
you'll find more than half of mankind down here.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.946
And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:19.260
who live in countries with about two children per woman.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.798
(Applause)

00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:26.758
It's a quite amazing development which has happened.

00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:28.135
(Applause)

00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:31.337
And these are countries from United States here,

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:33.498
with $40,000 per capita,

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:36.445
France, Russia, Iran,

00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:40.097
Mexico, Turkey, Algeria,

00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:42.322
Indonesia, India

00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:45.051
and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,

00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:49.094
which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States

00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:52.251
and the same amount of babies per woman.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.482
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:57.571
is surprisingly good in all countries.

00:05:57.571 --> 00:05:59.518
We get that from the census data.

00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:02.911
It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.

00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:04.217
So what we can conclude

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:06.998
is you don't have to get rich to have few children.

00:06:06.998 --> 00:06:09.340
It has happened across the world.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.918
And then when we look at religions,

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:14.445
we can see that the Eastern religions,

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:17.445
indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:19.340
that has more than three children.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.392
Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:25.300
you see countries all the way.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.078
But there's no major difference.

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:30.580
There's no major difference between these religions.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.931
There is a difference with income.

00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.860
The countries which have many babies per woman here,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.792
they have quite low income.

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:42.223
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:44.885
But there are also countries here

00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:49.002
like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:51.808
like Yemen and Afghanistan.

00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:55.685
Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo,

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:59.135
which have suffered severe conflicts,

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:01.892
that they don't have fast population growth.

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:03.669
It's the other way around.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.562
In the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates

00:07:07.562 --> 00:07:09.798
that have the fastest population growth.

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:13.786
Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:16.694
These countries have six children per woman.

00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:20.826
They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.

00:07:20.826 --> 00:07:24.645
But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:28.052
Congo will go from 60 to 120.

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:30.943
That's where we have the fast population growth.

00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:35.288
And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.802
Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:41.260
with a Christian dominated country, Ghana.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.857
I take them backwards here to their independence,

00:07:44.857 --> 00:07:48.540
when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.638
Just look what they have done.

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.189
It's an amazing improvement,

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:54.426
from seven children per woman,

00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:57.491
they've gone all the way down to between four and five.

00:07:57.491 --> 00:07:59.078
It's a tremendous improvement.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.503
So what does it take?

00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:04.100
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.589
You need to have children to survive.

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:09.202
You need to get out of the deepest poverty

00:08:09.202 --> 00:08:12.780
so children are not of importance for work in the family.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.651
You need to have access to some family planning.

00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:19.983
And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.

00:08:19.983 --> 00:08:22.891
But let me illustrate that fourth factor

00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:24.992
by looking at Qatar.

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:28.792
Here we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:32.429
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.500
which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 --

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.374
it's a quite amazing development which had happened.

00:08:39.374 --> 00:08:41.180
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.438
With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.552
in number of babies per woman.

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:48.555
And what is the reason in Qatar?

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:50.214
Well I do as I always do.

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:53.986
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage --

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:56.117
It's a very good webpage. I recommend it --

00:08:56.117 --> 00:09:02.608
and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here --

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:06.675
and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.

00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:09.020
Very interesting. Lots to read.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.592
I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.

00:09:13.592 --> 00:09:17.143
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,

00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:19.798
and they say the most important factors are:

00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:21.740
"Increased age at first marriage,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.765
increased educational level of Qatari woman

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.078
and more women integrated in the labor force."

00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:31.820
I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.337
This is a country that indeed has gone through

00:09:34.337 --> 00:09:37.872
a very, very interesting modernization.

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:40.497
So what it is, is these four:

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.580
Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.482
women should get education and join the labor force

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:48.755
and family planning should be accessible.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.143
Now look again at this.

00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:54.435
The average number of children in the world

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:57.857
is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today.

00:09:57.857 --> 00:10:00.894
There are countries up here which are very poor.

00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:04.845
And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:08.632
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.

00:10:08.632 --> 00:10:14.091
And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.

00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.703
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,

00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:19.245
it's two.

00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:21.774
We have reached peak child.

00:10:21.774 --> 00:10:24.663
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.

00:10:24.663 --> 00:10:26.655
We are still debating peak oil,

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:29.586
but we have definitely reached peak child.

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:32.309
And the world population will stop growing.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:34.411
The United Nations Population Division has said

00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:36.851
it will stop growing at 10 billion.

00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:40.891
But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?

00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:43.337
Well I will show you here.

00:10:43.337 --> 00:10:47.112
I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:50.946
They are quite useful for educational purposes.

00:10:50.946 --> 00:10:53.854
Each card box is one billion people.

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:56.522
And there are two billion children in the world.

00:10:56.522 --> 00:11:03.392
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30.

00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:04.862
These are rounded numbers.

00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:09.888
Then there is one billion between 30 and 45,

00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:13.731
almost one between 45 and 60.

00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:15.355
And then it's my box.

00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:17.380
This is me: 60-plus.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.542
We are here on top.

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:24.774
So what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up."

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:27.762
You can see that it's like three billion missing here.

00:11:27.762 --> 00:11:32.069
They are not missing because they've died; they were never born.

00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:36.177
Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born

00:11:36.177 --> 00:11:38.934
than there were during the last 30 years.

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:42.088
So what will happen now is quite straightforward.

00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:44.885
The old, sadly, we will die.

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:49.540
The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.148
Then the old will die.

00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:56.186
The rest will grow older and get two billion children.

00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:01.955
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.209
(Applause)

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:07.842
This is the great fill-up.

00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:10.614
It's inevitable.

00:12:10.614 --> 00:12:13.260
And can you see that this increase took place

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.063
without life getting longer and without adding children?

00:12:18.063 --> 00:12:22.968
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:26.237
All the religions in the world are fully capable

00:12:26.237 --> 00:12:31.362
to maintain their values and adapt to this new world.

00:12:31.362 --> 00:12:36.645
And we will be just 10 billion in this world,

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:40.229
if the poorest people get out of poverty,

00:12:40.229 --> 00:12:43.402
their children survive, they get access to family planning.

00:12:43.402 --> 00:12:45.302
That is needed.

00:12:45.302 --> 00:12:51.017
But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.

00:12:51.017 --> 00:12:54.229
So when you discuss and when you plan

00:12:54.229 --> 00:12:57.632
for the resources and the energy needed for the future,

00:12:57.632 --> 00:12:59.965
for human beings on this planet,

00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.122
you have to plan for 10 billion.

00:13:02.122 --> 00:13:04.272
Thank you very much.

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:10.358
(Applause)
