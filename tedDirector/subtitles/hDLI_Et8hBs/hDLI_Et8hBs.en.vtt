00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.335
When I arrived in Kiev,

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.731
on February 1 this year,

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.350
Independence Square was under siege,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.988
surrounded by police
loyal to the government.

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:26.529
The protesters who occupied Maidan,

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.361
as the square is known,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.981
prepared for battle,

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:32.215
stockpiling homemade weapons

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.692
and mass-producing improvised body armor.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.133
The Euromaidan protests began peacefully
at the end of 2013,

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.353
after the president of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,

00:00:44.364 --> 00:00:47.850
rejected a far-reaching accord
with the European Union

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.996
in favor of stronger ties with Russia.

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:54.204
In response, tens of thousands
of dissatisfied citizens

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:58.267
poured into central Kiev
to demonstrate against this allegiance.

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:01.291
As the months passed,

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.370
confrontations between police
and civilians intensified.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:12.248
I set up a makeshift portrait studio
by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:16.551
There, I photographed
the fighters against a black curtain,

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:20.909
a curtain that obscured
the highly seductive and visual backdrop

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:23.330
of fire, ice and smoke.

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:28.242
In order to tell the individual
human stories here,

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:31.376
I felt that I needed to remove
the dramatic visuals

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:36.455
that had become so familiar and repetitive
within the mainstream media.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:40.593
What I was witnessing
was not only news, but also history.

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:41.928
With this realization,

00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:44.864
I was free from
the photojournalistic conventions

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:46.938
of the newspaper and the magazine.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.895
Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim
were all ordinary men,

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:54.934
with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.623
But the elaborate costumes
that they had bedecked themselves in

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:00.953
were quite extraordinary.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.744
I say the word "costume"

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:05.169
because these were not clothes
that had been issued

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:06.634
or coordinated by anyone.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.483
They were improvised uniforms

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:12.363
made up of decommissioned
military equipment,

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:17.725
irregular combat fatigues
and trophies taken from the police.

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:22.297
I became interested in the way they
were choosing to represent themselves,

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:25.843
this outward expression of masculinity,

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:27.176
the ideal of the warrior.

00:02:28.724 --> 00:02:32.009
I worked slowly,
using an analog film camera

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.739
with a manual focusing loop
and a handheld light meter.

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:37.505
The process is old-fashioned.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.268
It gives me time to speak with each person

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:44.977
and to look at them, in silence,
while they look back at me.

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:50.982
Rising tensions culminated
in the worst day of violence

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:52.711
on February 20,

00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.663
which became known as Bloody Thursday.

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.717
Snipers, loyal to the government,

00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:03.095
started firing on the civilians
and protesters on Institutskaya Street.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.833
Many were killed
in a very short space of time.

00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:11.236
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine
became a makeshift morgue.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:14.238
There were lines
of bodies laid in the street.

00:03:14.282 --> 00:03:16.551
And there was blood
all over the pavements.

00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:22.146
The following day,
President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:23.904
In all, three months of protests

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.373
resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.920
and many more missing.

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:31.956
History unfolded quickly,

00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:34.377
but celebration remained
elusive in Maidan.

00:03:35.488 --> 00:03:38.289
As the days passed
in Kiev's central square,

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.828
streams of armed fighters

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:43.254
were joined by tens of thousands
of ordinary people,

00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:45.825
filling the streets in an act
of collective mourning.

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.588
Many were women who often carried flowers

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:53.768
that they had brought to lay
as marks of respect for the dead.

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:55.339
They came day after day

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.076
and they covered the square
with millions of flowers.

00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:03.281
Sadness enveloped Maidan.

00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.895
It was quiet and I could hear
the birds singing.

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.141
I hadn't heard that before.

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.639
I stopped women
as they approached the barricades

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.782
to lay their tributes

00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:13.627
and asked to make their picture.

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:17.592
Most women cried when I photographed them.

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:19.768
On the first day,
my fixer, Emine, and I cried

00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:22.971
with almost every woman
who visited our studio.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:27.882
There had been such a noticeable
absence of women

00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:29.625
up until that point.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:31.918
And the color of their pastel coats,

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:33.656
their shiny handbags,

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:35.746
and the bunches of red carnations,

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.952
white tulips and yellow roses
that they carried

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.113
jarred with the blackened square

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.419
and the blackened men
who were encamped there.

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.956
It is clear to me
that these two sets of pictures

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:50.694
don't make much sense without the other.

00:04:50.694 --> 00:04:53.091
They are about men and women
and the way we are --

00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:55.831
not the way we look,
but the way we are.

00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:58.663
They speak about different
gender roles in conflict,

00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:01.188
not only in Maidan,
and not only in Ukraine.

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:06.399
Men fight most wars and women mourn them.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.835
If the men showed
the ideal of the warrior,

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.514
then the women showed
the implications of such violence.

00:05:13.256 --> 00:05:15.020
When I made these pictures,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.824
I believed that I was documenting
the end of violent events in Ukraine.

00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:22.317
But now I understand
that it is a record of the beginning.

00:05:22.317 --> 00:05:25.730
Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.121
while hundreds of thousands
have been displaced.

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:32.547
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.

00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:36.035
In Maidan, the barricades
have been dismantled,

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.917
and the paving stones which were used
as weapons during the protests replaced,

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:44.129
so that traffic flows freely
through the center of the square.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.170
The fighters, the women
and the flowers are gone.

00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:52.534
A huge billboard depicting geese
flying over a wheat field

00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:55.778
covers the burned-out shell
of the trade union's building

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:57.134
and proclaims,

00:05:57.234 --> 00:05:58.685
"Glory to Ukraine.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.383
Glory to heroes."

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:01.383
Thank you.

00:06:01.383 --> 00:06:04.900
(Applause).
