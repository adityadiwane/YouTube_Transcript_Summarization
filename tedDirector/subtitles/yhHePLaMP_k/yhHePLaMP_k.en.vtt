00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And it comes in a male form, too --

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
very glamorous.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
there actually is a little wine in there --

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and of course, always wears a tuxedo.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
but also comes in other forms.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
A magazine?

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Well, it's certainly not this one.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Sex tips are not glamorous.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
is not glamorous either.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
But there is a glamour of industry.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
This is Margaret Bourke-White's --

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
one of her pictures she did.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
Fantastic, glamorous pictures

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
And there's the mythic glamour

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
of the garage entrepreneur.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
There's the glamour of physics.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
he has other kinds of glamour.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
And there is, of course, this glamour.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
and not the alien-style glamour,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
but the nice, clean, early '60s version.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
So what do we mean by glamour?

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
is you can look in the dictionary.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
in this case the 1913 dictionary.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330
and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
You had "a" glamour.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
Glamour was a literal magic spell.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and to some extent, Celtic magic.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.330
it started to take on this other kind of deception --

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.330
this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.330
an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
But still, glamour is an illusion.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
Glamour is a magic spell.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
And there's something dangerous about glamour

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
on you, it was not in your self-interest --

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
it was to get you to act against your interest.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
Well of course, in the 20th century,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
And this is Hedy Lamarr.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.330
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.330
about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.330
depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
they call them false color.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
Glamour is a form of falsification,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.330
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And it involves a great deal of technique.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
It's not -- glamour is not something --

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
and it's not just the case for people.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
Glamour doesn't have to be people.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Architectural photography --

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
It puts you into this special, special world.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
This is Alex Ross's comic book art,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
which appears to be extremely realistic,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.330
as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
When you stack people in rows,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
but not in the world of glamour.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
in the table of contents of New York magazine,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
which was telling us that glamour is back --

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
glamour is all about transcending the everyday.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
that combines all sorts of glamour is.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And I don't know who she is either,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
It's a very glamorous portrait.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
Why is it glamorous?

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
but that does not make you glamorous,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
that only makes you beautiful.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.330
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
and those are the central qualities of glamour.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.330
You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
She's not looking away from you exactly,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
but you have to mentally imagine her world.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.330
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
That's glamour:

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Glamour invites us to live in a different world.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
that's why, often in these glamour shots,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
the person is not looking at the audience,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
it's why sunglasses are glamorous --

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
In some sense, there has to be something like us.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
omniscient -- too far above us.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
but it has to have this transcendent quality.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
What is it about Superman?

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
Glamour is all about transcending this world

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.330
and getting to an idealized, perfect place.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
And this is one reason that modes of transportation

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
tend to be extremely glamorous.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
The less experience we have with them,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
the more glamorous they are.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
The notion is that it's going to transport you,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
The story is about where you're arriving,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
or thinking about where you're arriving.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
And this sense of being transported

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
is one reason that we have glamour styling.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.330
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.330
because we associate it with movies of that period, but because,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
because, to me, it captures the whole promise

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
of the academic contemplative life --

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
city streets -- not so glamorous.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.330
The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
except, possibly, multiple horizons.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
you just see the possibilities.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
after a few centuries.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.330
And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
It makes things look effortless.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
she just looks completely natural.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
Of course, they covered that with make-up,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.330
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
Glamour is about editing.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
How do you create the sense of transcendence,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
the sense of evoking a perfect world?

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
We don't tell you all the grubby details.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
This is underneath Jeff's desk.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
This is what the real world of computers,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
But if you look in a catalog --

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
it looks like this.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
There are no cords.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
you don't get to live in the world without cords.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
And there she is -- Grace.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.330
because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
Translucence is glamorous --

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
that's why all these people wear pearls.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.330
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
not transparent, not opaque.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
It invites us into the world

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:34.330
maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
It has that sense of going up and away,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.330
and yet you never think about how you would really trip

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
if you were -- particularly going down.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
but glamour's really partly about meaning.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
All individuals and all cultures have ideals

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.330
that cannot possibly be realized in reality.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
They have contradictions,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
to our lives as cultures and as individuals.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
And the way we deal with that is we displace them --

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
an age of heroes, the world to come.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.330
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.330
The white picket fence, the perfect house.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
the perfect diamond ring.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
The perfect getaway in your perfect car.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
The perfect office --

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
again, no cords, as far as I can tell.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
I mean, there's no paper on the desk.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
We want this golden world.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
And some people get rich enough,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
they get to acquire their perfect world.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
Is it something important?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
It was criticized for glamorizing violence,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.330
because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
that are impossible in the real world.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
You know, we're marching toward Utopia.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
Because what they're doing is they're saying,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
But actually, what's even more important

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
brilliant editing to cut together things.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
There's a glamour shot.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
National Socialism is all about glamour.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
It was a very aesthetic ideology.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
and ridding it of anything unglamorous.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
So glamour can be dangerous.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
I'm not against glamour.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.330
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
and confront the manipulation of it all,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.330
and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
but also enjoy how it happens.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
And here's Hedy Lamarr.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
even though she thought she could look stupid.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
which only took a fraction of a second to happen.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
There is a book out in the bookstore --

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
it's called "Symphony In Steel,"

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
And that has a fascination.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.330
There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.330
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
But I also knew how hard they worked all week.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
when you realize what went into creating it.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.330
Thank you.
