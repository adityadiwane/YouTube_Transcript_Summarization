00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:15.818
I need to make a confession
at the outset here.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:20.595
A little over 20 years ago,
I did something that I regret,

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.342
something that I'm not
particularly proud of.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.416
Something that, in many ways,
I wish no one would ever know,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.699
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:32.743
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.024
In the late 1980s,

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:39.443
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:40.968
I went to law school.

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:42.930
(Laughter)

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.103
In America, law is a professional degree:

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.832
after your university degree,
you go on to law school.

00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:52.296
When I got to law school,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.430
I didn't do very well.

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.664
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:00.695
I, in fact, graduated in the part
of my law school class

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.136
that made the top 90% possible.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.382
(Laughter)

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.208
Thank you.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:14.540
I never practiced law a day in my life;

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:16.548
I pretty much wasn't allowed to.

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:18.169
(Laughter)

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.791
But today, against my better judgment,

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.136
against the advice of my own wife,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.136
I want to try to dust off
some of those legal skills --

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.519
what's left of those legal skills.

00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:33.289
I don't want to tell you a story.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.524
I want to make a case.

00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:38.914
I want to make a hard-headed,

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:40.136
evidence-based,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.334
dare I say lawyerly case,

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:46.107
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:49.938
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:51.405
take a look at this.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.736
This is called the candle problem.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.434
Some of you might know it.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.136
It's created in 1945

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.136
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.136
He created this experiment

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.291
that is used in many other experiments
in behavioral science.

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:07.136
And here's how it works.
Suppose I'm the experimenter.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.780
I bring you into a room.

00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:13.028
I give you a candle,
some thumbtacks and some matches.

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:14.123
And I say to you,

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:17.136
"Your job is to attach
the candle to the wall

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.286
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.845
Now what would you do?

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.464
Many people begin trying
to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:26.826
Doesn't work.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.580
I saw somebody
kind of make the motion over here --

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.708
some people have a great idea
where they light the match,

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:37.661
melt the side of the candle,
try to adhere it to the wall.

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.780
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.136
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.136
most people figure out the solution,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.905
which you can see here.

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.719
The key is to overcome
what's called functional fixedness.

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:54.707
You look at that box and you see it
only as a receptacle for the tacks.

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.737
But it can also have this other function,

00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.023
as a platform for the candle.

00:02:59.047 --> 00:03:00.136
The candle problem.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.131
I want to tell you about an experiment
using the candle problem,

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.614
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.759
who is now at Princeton University, US,

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:12.136
This shows the power of incentives.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.136
He gathered his participants and said:

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.985
"I'm going to time you, how quickly
you can solve this problem."

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.485
To one group he said,

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.136
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.701
averages for how long it typically takes
someone to solve this sort of problem."

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:29.136
To the second group he offered rewards.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.883
He said, "If you're in the top 25%
of the fastest times,

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:34.915
you get five dollars.

00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:39.627
If you're the fastest of everyone
we're testing here today,

00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.136
you get 20 dollars."

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.043
Now this is several years ago,
adjusted for inflation,

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:46.612
it's a decent sum of money
for a few minutes of work.

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:48.136
It's a nice motivator.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.303
Question:

00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:52.644
How much faster did this group
solve the problem?

00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:54.783
Answer:

00:03:54.807 --> 00:04:00.449
It took them, on average,
three and a half minutes longer.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.688
3.5 min longer.

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:03.534
This makes no sense, right?

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:06.661
I mean, I'm an American.
I believe in free markets.

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.136
That's not how it's supposed
to work, right?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.344
(Laughter)

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:14.283
If you want people to perform better,
you reward them. Right?

00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:17.136
Bonuses, commissions,
their own reality show.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.178
Incentivize them.

00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:21.405
That's how business works.

00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:23.442
But that's not happening here.

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.136
You've got an incentive designed

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.956
to sharpen thinking
and accelerate creativity,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.136
and it does just the opposite.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.136
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.091
What's interesting about this experiment

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:37.685
is that it's not an aberration.

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:40.794
This has been replicated
over and over again

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:43.836
for nearly 40 years.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.136
These contingent motivators --

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.534
if you do this, then you get that --

00:04:48.558 --> 00:04:50.136
work in some circumstances.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.972
But for a lot of tasks,
they actually either don't work

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:55.892
or, often, they do harm.

00:04:56.848 --> 00:05:01.737
This is one of the most robust findings
in social science,

00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:05.294
and also one of the most ignored.

00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:06.908
I spent the last couple of years

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:09.003
looking at the science
of human motivation,

00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:11.389
particularly the dynamics
of extrinsic motivators

00:05:11.413 --> 00:05:13.136
and intrinsic motivators.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.572
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.

00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:17.934
If you look at the science,
there is a mismatch

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.811
between what science knows

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:21.246
and what business does.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.516
What's alarming here
is that our business operating system --

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.848
think of the set of assumptions
and protocols beneath our businesses,

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:31.581
how we motivate people,
how we apply our human resources--

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.860
it's built entirely
around these extrinsic motivators,

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:37.455
around carrots and sticks.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.668
That's actually fine for many kinds
of 20th century tasks.

00:05:41.692 --> 00:05:43.803
But for 21st century tasks,

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:47.358
that mechanistic,
reward-and-punishment approach

00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:49.050
doesn't work,

00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:50.556
often doesn't work,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.751
and often does harm.

00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:52.958
Let me show you.

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:56.059
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.696
he presented the problem
in a slightly different way,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.740
like this up here.

00:06:00.662 --> 00:06:03.939
Attach the candle to the wall
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:06.439
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:08.905
You: we're incentivizing.

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:10.380
What happened this time?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.564
This time, the incentivized group
kicked the other group's butt.

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:18.603
Why?

00:06:19.414 --> 00:06:21.921
Because when the tacks are out of the box,

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:23.577
it's pretty easy isn't it?

00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:27.871
(Laughter)

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:32.873
If-then rewards work really well
for those sorts of tasks,

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:34.613
where there is a simple set of rules

00:06:34.637 --> 00:06:37.136
and a clear destination to go to.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.136
Rewards, by their very nature,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.136
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.495
that's why they work in so many cases.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:45.598
So, for tasks like this,

00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:48.975
a narrow focus, where you just see
the goal right there,

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.379
zoom straight ahead to it,

00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:52.032
they work really well.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:54.776
But for the real candle problem,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.792
you don't want to be looking like this.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.946
The solution is on the periphery.
You want to be looking around.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.597
That reward actually narrows our focus

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.136
and restricts our possibility.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.130
Let me tell you why this is so important.

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:10.439
In western Europe,

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.548
in many parts of Asia,

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:14.347
in North America, in Australia,

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.937
white-collar workers are doing
less of this kind of work,

00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.341
and more of this kind of work.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.996
That routine, rule-based,
left-brain work --

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.736
certain kinds of accounting,
financial analysis,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.455
computer programming --

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.674
has become fairly easy to outsource,

00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:33.729
fairly easy to automate.

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.929
Software can do it faster.

00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:38.278
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:41.270
So what really matters

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:45.922
are the more right-brained
creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:48.327
Think about your own work.

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.096
Think about your own work.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:52.615
Are the problems that you face,

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.136
or even the problems
we've been talking about here,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.048
do they have a clear set of rules,

00:07:58.072 --> 00:07:59.659
and a single solution?

00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:02.136
No. The rules are mystifying.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.406
The solution, if it exists at all,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.136
is surprising and not obvious.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.914
Everybody in this room

00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:14.136
is dealing with their own version
of the candle problem.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.297
And for candle problems of any kind,

00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:18.991
in any field,

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:22.008
those if-then rewards,

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:26.274
the things around which we've built
so many of our businesses,

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.131
don't work!

00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:30.611
It makes me crazy.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.571
And here's the thing.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.651
This is not a feeling.

00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:38.950
Okay? I'm a lawyer;
I don't believe in feelings.

00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:42.617
This is not a philosophy.

00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:44.903
I'm an American;
I don't believe in philosophy.

00:08:44.927 --> 00:08:46.614
(Laughter)

00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:50.493
This is a fact --

00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:52.961
or, as we say in my hometown
of Washington, D.C.,

00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:54.575
a true fact.

00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:57.043
(Laughter)

00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:00.861
(Applause)

00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:02.527
Let me give you an example.

00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:04.136
Let me marshal the evidence here.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.273
I'm not telling a story,
I'm making a case.

00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:08.568
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, some evidence:

00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:11.967
Dan Ariely, one of the great
economists of our time,

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.462
he and three colleagues
did a study of some MIT students.

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:18.136
They gave these MIT
students a bunch of games,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.136
games that involved creativity,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.438
and motor skills, and concentration.

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:24.543
And the offered them, for performance,

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:26.581
three levels of rewards:

00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:30.851
small reward, medium reward,
large reward.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:35.012
If you do really well
you get the large reward, on down.

00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:36.370
What happened?

00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:39.136
As long as the task
involved only mechanical skill

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.136
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.857
the higher the pay,
the better the performance.

00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:46.032
Okay?

00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:51.136
But once the task called
for even rudimentary cognitive skill,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.232
a larger reward led to poorer performance.

00:09:57.256 --> 00:09:58.406
Then they said,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.565
"Let's see if there's any
cultural bias here.

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:02.542
Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."

00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:04.136
Standard of living is lower.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.637
In Madurai, a reward that is modest
in North American standards,

00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:09.002
is more meaningful there.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.261
Same deal. A bunch of games,
three levels of rewards.

00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:14.374
What happens?

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.301
People offered the medium level of rewards

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:20.905
did no better than people
offered the small rewards.

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:25.408
But this time,
people offered the highest rewards,

00:10:25.432 --> 00:10:26.928
they did the worst of all.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:32.350
In eight of the nine tasks we examined
across three experiments,

00:10:32.374 --> 00:10:35.843
higher incentives led
to worse performance.

00:10:37.634 --> 00:10:43.610
Is this some kind of touchy-feely
socialist conspiracy going on here?

00:10:43.634 --> 00:10:46.410
No, these are economists from MIT,

00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:49.136
from Carnegie Mellon,
from the University of Chicago.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.781
Do you know who sponsored this research?

00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:55.925
The Federal Reserve Bank
of the United States.

00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:57.769
That's the American experience.

00:10:57.793 --> 00:11:00.568
Let's go across the pond
to the London School of Economics,

00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:03.136
LSE, London School of Economics,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.604
alma mater of eleven
Nobel Laureates in economics.

00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:09.136
Training ground for great
economic thinkers

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.136
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.447
and Mick Jagger.

00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.770
(Laughter)

00:11:14.794 --> 00:11:16.564
Last month,

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:18.087
just last month,

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:21.136
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.136
of pay-for-performance plans,
inside of companies.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.611
Here's what they said:

00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:27.431
"We find that financial incentives

00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:31.508
can result in a negative impact
on overall performance."

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:36.635
There is a mismatch
between what science knows

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:38.136
and what business does.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.437
And what worries me,
as we stand here in the rubble

00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:43.136
of the economic collapse,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.136
is that too many organizations
are making their decisions,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.532
their policies about talent and people,

00:11:49.556 --> 00:11:53.683
based on assumptions that are outdated,

00:11:53.707 --> 00:11:54.897
unexamined,

00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:57.683
and rooted more in folklore
than in science.

00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:01.136
And if we really want to get
out of this economic mess,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.253
if we really want high performance

00:12:03.277 --> 00:12:05.724
on those definitional tasks
of the 21st century,

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:11.688
the solution is not to do
more of the wrong things,

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:14.035
to entice people with a sweeter carrot,

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:16.458
or threaten them with a sharper stick.

00:12:16.482 --> 00:12:18.136
We need a whole new approach.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.136
The good news is that the scientists

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.348
who've been studying motivation
have given us this new approach.

00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:26.467
It's built much more
around intrinsic motivation.

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:28.946
Around the desire to do things
because they matter,

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.533
because we like it, they're interesting,
or part of something important.

00:12:32.557 --> 00:12:36.136
And to my mind, that new operating
system for our businesses

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.861
revolves around three elements:

00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:41.136
autonomy, mastery and purpose.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.136
Autonomy: the urge
to direct our own lives.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.405
Mastery: the desire to get better
and better at something that matters.

00:12:48.429 --> 00:12:51.136
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.353
in the service of something
larger than ourselves.

00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:57.671
These are the building blocks
of an entirely new operating system

00:12:57.695 --> 00:12:59.136
for our businesses.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.721
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.136
In the 20th century, we came up
with this idea of management.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.454
Management did not emanate from nature.

00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:12.136
Management is not a tree,
it's a television set.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.384
Somebody invented it.

00:13:14.408 --> 00:13:16.408
It doesn't mean
it's going to work forever.

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:18.439
Management is great.

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:20.517
Traditional notions
of management are great

00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:22.136
if you want compliance.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.343
But if you want engagement,
self-direction works better.

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:29.407
Some examples of some kind
of radical notions of self-direction.

00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:32.367
You don't see a lot of it,

00:13:32.391 --> 00:13:35.867
but you see the first stirrings
of something really interesting going on,

00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:39.534
what it means is paying people adequately
and fairly, absolutely --

00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:41.843
getting the issue of money off the table,

00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:43.842
and then giving people lots of autonomy.

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.136
Some examples.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.105
How many of you have heard
of the company Atlassian?

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:51.136
It looks like less than half.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.565
(Laughter)

00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:57.136
Atlassian is an Australian
software company.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.131
And they do something incredibly cool.

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:01.899
A few times a year
they tell their engineers,

00:14:01.923 --> 00:14:05.929
"Go for the next 24 hours
and work on anything you want,

00:14:05.953 --> 00:14:08.063
as long as it's not part
of your regular job.

00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:09.477
Work on anything you want."

00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:13.264
Engineers use this time to come up
with a cool patch for code,

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:14.730
come up with an elegant hack.

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:17.720
Then they present all of the stuff
that they've developed

00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:20.464
to their teammates,
to the rest of the company,

00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:24.440
in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting
at the end of the day.

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:26.659
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:28.703
They call them FedEx Days.

00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:30.641
Why?

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:34.063
Because you have to deliver
something overnight.

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:36.544
It's pretty; not bad.

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:39.236
It's a huge trademark violation,
but it's pretty clever.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.597
(Laughter)

00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:42.299
That one day of intense autonomy

00:14:42.323 --> 00:14:44.375
has produced a whole array
of software fixes

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.136
that might never have existed.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.228
It's worked so well that Atlassian
has taken it to the next level

00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:50.310
with 20% time --

00:14:50.334 --> 00:14:52.502
done, famously, at Google --

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:54.588
where engineers can spend
20% of their time

00:14:54.612 --> 00:14:56.557
working on anything they want.

00:14:56.581 --> 00:14:58.248
They have autonomy over their time,

00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:00.485
their task, their team, their technique.

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:02.463
Radical amounts of autonomy.

00:15:02.487 --> 00:15:06.413
And at Google, as many of you know,

00:15:06.437 --> 00:15:08.770
about half of the new products
in a typical year

00:15:08.794 --> 00:15:11.270
are birthed during that 20% time:

00:15:11.294 --> 00:15:14.136
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.080
Let me give you an even more
radical example of it:

00:15:17.104 --> 00:15:20.977
something called the Results Only
Work Environment (the ROWE),

00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.067
created by two American consultants,

00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:25.770
in place at a dozen companies
around North America.

00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:28.399
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.375
They show up when they want.

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:35.453
They don't have to be in the office
at a certain time, or any time.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.422
They just have to get their work done.

00:15:37.446 --> 00:15:41.605
How they do it, when they do it,
where they do it, is totally up to them.

00:15:42.644 --> 00:15:45.975
Meetings in these kinds
of environments are optional.

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:48.500
What happens?

00:15:48.524 --> 00:15:50.235
Almost across the board,

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:53.469
productivity goes up,
worker engagement goes up,

00:15:53.493 --> 00:15:57.136
worker satisfaction goes up,
turnover goes down.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.136
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.772
the building blocks
of a new way of doing things.

00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:04.136
Some of you might look at this and say,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.620
"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."

00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:08.998
And I say, "Nope.

00:16:10.525 --> 00:16:12.093
I have proof."

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:16.136
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started
an encyclopedia called Encarta.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.477
They had deployed
all the right incentives,

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:23.350
They paid professionals
to write and edit thousands of articles.

00:16:23.374 --> 00:16:25.963
Well-compensated managers
oversaw the whole thing

00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:28.245
to make sure it came in
on budget and on time.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.664
A few years later,
another encyclopedia got started.

00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:34.085
Different model, right?

00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:37.166
Do it for fun.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.757
No one gets paid a cent,
or a euro or a yen.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:43.180
Do it because you like to do it.

00:16:43.204 --> 00:16:45.136
Just 10 years ago,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.409
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,

00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:51.008
"Hey, I've got these two different
models for creating an encyclopedia.

00:16:51.032 --> 00:16:53.953
If they went head to head, who would win?"

00:16:53.977 --> 00:16:57.543
10 years ago you could not
have found a single sober economist

00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.787
anywhere on planet Earth

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.683
who would have predicted
the Wikipedia model.

00:17:02.707 --> 00:17:05.406
This is the titanic battle
between these two approaches.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.498
This is the Ali-Frazier
of motivation, right?

00:17:08.522 --> 00:17:10.361
This is the Thrilla in Manila.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:13.554
Intrinsic motivators
versus extrinsic motivators.

00:17:13.578 --> 00:17:15.136
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.717
versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:21.271
Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery
and purpose, in a knockout.

00:17:21.295 --> 00:17:22.295
Let me wrap up.

00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:27.986
There is a mismatch between
what science knows and what business does.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.597
Here is what science knows.

00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:31.304
One: Those 20th century rewards,

00:17:31.328 --> 00:17:34.308
those motivators we think
are a natural part of business,

00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:38.033
do work, but only in a surprisingly
narrow band of circumstances.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.850
Two: Those if-then rewards
often destroy creativity.

00:17:42.874 --> 00:17:46.674
Three: The secret to high performance
isn't rewards and punishments,

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.308
but that unseen intrinsic drive--

00:17:48.332 --> 00:17:51.136
the drive to do things for their own sake.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.136
The drive to do things cause they matter.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.136
And here's the best part.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.380
We already know this.

00:17:56.404 --> 00:17:58.954
The science confirms
what we know in our hearts.

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:03.808
So, if we repair this mismatch
between science and business,

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:06.765
if we bring our motivation,
notions of motivation

00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:08.516
into the 21st century,

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.554
if we get past this lazy,
dangerous, ideology

00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:14.610
of carrots and sticks,

00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:17.363
we can strengthen our businesses,

00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:19.969
we can solve a lot
of those candle problems,

00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:22.725
and maybe, maybe --

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.913
we can change the world.

00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:27.242
I rest my case.
