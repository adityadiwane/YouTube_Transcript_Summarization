00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.810
When I was seven years old
and my sister was just five years old,

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.236
we were playing on top of a bunk bed.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.286
I was two years older
than my sister at the time --

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.542
I mean, I'm two years
older than her now --

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.891
but at the time it meant she had to do
everything that I wanted to do,

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.236
and I wanted to play war.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.316
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.435
And on one side of the bunk bed,

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.069
I had put out all of my G.I. Joe
soldiers and weaponry.

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:40.981
And on the other side were
all my sister's My Little Ponies

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:42.450
ready for a cavalry charge.

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:45.767
There are differing accounts
of what actually happened that afternoon,

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.079
but since my sister is not
here with us today,

00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:49.999
let me tell you the true story --

00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:51.236
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.695
which is my sister's a little
on the clumsy side.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.741
Somehow, without any help or push
from her older brother at all,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.235
Amy disappeared
off of the top of the bunk bed

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.189
and landed with this crash on the floor.

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:03.227
I nervously peered
over the side of the bed

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.236
to see what had befallen my fallen sister

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.114
and saw that she had landed
painfully on her hands and knees

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:09.489
on all fours on the ground.

00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:11.989
I was nervous because
my parents had charged me

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:13.875
with making sure that my sister and I

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.236
played as safely
and as quietly as possible.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.912
And seeing as how I had
accidentally broken Amy's arm

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:21.236
just one week before --

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.197
(Laughter)

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.360
(Laughter ends)

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:31.044
heroically pushing her out of the way
of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.102
(Laughter)

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:37.209
for which I have yet to be thanked,
I was trying as hard as I could --

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.829
she didn't even see it coming --

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:41.194
I was trying hard
to be on my best behavior.

00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:42.568
And I saw my sister's face,

00:01:42.592 --> 00:01:44.828
this wail of pain
and suffering and surprise

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:47.536
threatening to erupt from her mouth
and wake my parents

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.156
from the long winter's nap
for which they had settled.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.336
So I did the only thing

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.798
my frantic seven year-old brain
could think to do to avert this tragedy.

00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:57.685
And if you have children,
you've seen this hundreds of times.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.436
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry.
Did you see how you landed?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.580
No human lands on all fours like that.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.236
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.629
(Laughter)

00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:10.762
Now, that was cheating,

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:12.915
because there was nothing
she would want more

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.580
than not to be Amy
the hurt five year-old little sister,

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.036
but Amy the special unicorn.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.184
Of course, this option
was open to her brain

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:20.392
at no point in the past.

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:23.513
And you could see how my poor,
manipulated sister faced conflict,

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:25.914
as her little brain attempted
to devote resources

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:29.237
to feeling the pain and suffering
and surprise she just experienced,

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:31.806
or contemplating her new-found
identity as a unicorn.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.936
And the latter won.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.799
Instead of crying or ceasing our play,

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:36.236
instead of waking my parents,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.567
with all the negative consequences for me,

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.236
a smile spread across her face

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.352
and she scrambled back up
onto the bunk bed

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:44.262
with all the grace of a baby unicorn --

00:02:44.286 --> 00:02:46.815
(Laughter)

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.229
with one broken leg.

00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:49.855
What we stumbled across

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.959
at this tender age
of just five and seven --

00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:53.655
we had no idea at the time --

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.780
was was going be at the vanguard
of a scientific revolution

00:02:56.804 --> 00:03:00.258
occurring two decades later in the way
that we look at the human brain.

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:03.197
We had stumbled across
something called positive psychology,

00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.866
which is the reason I'm here today

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.978
and the reason that I wake up
every morning.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.036
When I started talking about this research

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.336
outside of academia,
with companies and schools,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.436
the first thing they said to never do
is to start with a graph.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.914
The first thing I want to do
is start with a graph.

00:03:16.938 --> 00:03:18.236
This graph looks boring,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.211
but it is the reason I get excited
and wake up every morning.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:24.000
And this graph doesn't even mean
anything; it's fake data.

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:25.295
What we found is --

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.236
(Laughter)

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.236
If I got this data studying you,
I would be thrilled,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.236
because there's a trend there,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.236
and that means that I can get published,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.236
which is all that really matters.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.336
There is one weird red dot
above the curve,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.861
there's one weirdo in the room --

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:44.910
I know who you are, I saw you earlier --

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.236
that's no problem.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.236
That's no problem, as most of you know,
because I can just delete that dot.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.364
I can delete that dot because
that's clearly a measurement error.

00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:56.754
And we know that's a measurement error
because it's messing up my data.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.817
(Laughter)

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:00.004
So one of the first things we teach people

00:04:00.028 --> 00:04:02.844
in economics, statistics,
business and psychology courses

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.033
is how, in a statistically valid way,
do we eliminate the weirdos.

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:09.436
How do we eliminate the outliers
so we can find the line of best fit?

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.556
Which is fantastic
if I'm trying to find out

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.336
how many Advil the average
person should be taking -- two.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.171
But if I'm interested in your potential,

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:20.236
or for happiness or productivity
or energy or creativity,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.831
we're creating the cult
of the average with science.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.236
If I asked a question like,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.957
"How fast can a child learn
how to read in a classroom?"

00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:28.466
scientists change the answer to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.829
"How fast does the average child
learn how to read in that classroom?"

00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:33.999
and we tailor the class
towards the average.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.546
If you fall below the average,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.163
then psychologists get thrilled,

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:40.003
because that means you're
depressed or have a disorder,

00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:41.236
or hopefully both.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.736
We're hoping for both
because our business model is,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.236
if you come into a therapy
session with one problem,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.736
we want to make sure you
leave knowing you have ten,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.936
so you keep coming back.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.175
We'll go back into your
childhood if necessary,

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.475
but eventually we want
to make you normal again.

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:55.936
But normal is merely average.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.308
And positive psychology posits
that if we study what is merely average,

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.664
we will remain merely average.

00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:03.982
Then instead of deleting
those positive outliers,

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:07.048
what I intentionally do is come
into a population like this one

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.088
and say, why?

00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:10.036
Why are some of you high above the curve

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.645
in terms of intellectual,
athletic, musical ability,

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.936
creativity, energy levels,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.436
resiliency in the face
of challenge, sense of humor?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.003
Whatever it is, instead of deleting
you, what I want to do is study you.

00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:21.936
Because maybe we can glean information,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.114
not just how to move
people up to the average,

00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:27.536
but move the entire average up
in our companies and schools worldwide.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.536
The reason this graph is important to me

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.636
is, on the news, the majority
of the information is not positive.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.736
in fact it's negative.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.936
Most of it's about murder, corruption,
diseases, natural disasters.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.036
And very quickly, my brain starts to think

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.055
that's the accurate ratio
of negative to positive in the world.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.283
This creates
"the medical school syndrome."

00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:46.863
During the first year of medical training,

00:05:46.887 --> 00:05:50.275
as you read through a list of all
the symptoms and diseases,

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:52.530
suddenly you realize you have all of them.

00:05:52.554 --> 00:05:53.555
(Laughter)

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:56.651
I have a brother in-law named Bobo,
which is a whole other story.

00:05:56.675 --> 00:05:58.237
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.

00:05:58.261 --> 00:05:59.993
Bobo called me on the phone --

00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:02.162
(Laughter)

00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:04.236
from Yale Medical School,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.541
and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:08.236
(Laughter)

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.847
Which, even at Yale,
is extraordinarily rare.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.236
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.118
because he had just gotten
over an entire week of menopause.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.236
(Laughter)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.236
We're finding it's not necessarily
the reality that shapes us,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.036
but the lens through which your brain
views the world that shapes your reality.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.337
And if we can change the lens,
not only can we change your happiness,

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:31.009
we can change every single educational
and business outcome at the same time.

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.536
I applied to Harvard on a dare.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.736
I didn't expect to get in, and my family
had no money for college.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.936
When I got a military scholarship
two weeks later, they let me go.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.736
Something that wasn't
even a possibility became a reality.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.736
I assumed everyone there
would see it as a privilege as well,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.436
that they'd be excited to be there.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.936
Even in a classroom
full of people smarter than you,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.436
I felt you'd be happy just to be
in that classroom.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.136
But what I found is,
while some people experience that,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.936
when I graduated after my four years

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.537
and then spent the next eight years
living in the dorms with the students --

00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:01.440
Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.

00:07:01.464 --> 00:07:03.236
(Laughter)

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.636
I was an officer to counsel students
through the difficult four years.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.427
And in my research and my teaching,

00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:11.227
I found that these students,
no matter how happy they were

00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:13.936
with their original success
of getting into the school,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.736
two weeks later their brains were focused,
not on the privilege of being there,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.436
nor on their philosophy or physics,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.236
but on the competition, the workload,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.936
the hassles, stresses, complaints.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.136
When I first went in there, I walked
into the freshmen dining hall,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.536
which is where my friends from Waco,
Texas, which is where I grew up --

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.036
I know some of you know this.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.936
When they'd visit, they'd look around,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.136
and say, "This dining hall looks like
something out of Hogwart's."

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.736
It does, because that was Hogwart's
and that's Harvard.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.936
And when they see this,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.236
they say, "Why do you waste your time
studying happiness at Harvard?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.336
What does a Harvard student
possibly have to be unhappy about?"

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.836
Embedded within that question

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.436
is the key to understanding
the science of happiness.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.136
Because what that question assumes

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.232
is that our external world
is predictive of our happiness levels,

00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:58.332
when in reality, if I know everything
about your external world,

00:07:58.356 --> 00:08:00.836
I can only predict 10%
of your long-term happiness.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.636
90 percent of your long-term happiness
is predicted not by the external world,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.851
but by the way your brain
processes the world.

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:07.936
And if we change it,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.389
if we change our formula
for happiness and success,

00:08:10.413 --> 00:08:13.235
we can change the way
that we can then affect reality.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:17.236
What we found is that only 25%
of job successes are predicted by IQ,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.236
75 percent of job successes

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.236
are predicted by your optimism
levels, your social support

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.536
and your ability to see stress
as a challenge instead of as a threat.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.236
I talked to a New England boarding school,
probably the most prestigious one,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.036
and they said, "We already know that.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.736
So every year, instead of just teaching
our students, we have a wellness week.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.036
And we're so excited. Monday night
we have the world's leading expert

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.936
will speak about adolescent depression.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.199
Tuesday night
it's school violence and bullying.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.036
Wednesday night is eating disorders.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.736
Thursday night is illicit drug use.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.189
And Friday night we're trying to decide
between risky sex or happiness."

00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:50.236
(Laughter)

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.403
I said, "That's most people's
Friday nights."

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:55.236
(Laughter)

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.236
(Applause)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.118
Which I'm glad you liked,
but they did not like that at all.

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:02.236
Silence on the phone.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.536
And into the silence, I said,
"I'd be happy to speak at your school,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.236
but that's not a wellness week,
that's a sickness week.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.936
You've outlined all the negative
things that can happen,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.636
but not talked about the positive."

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.436
The absence of disease is not health.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.836
Here's how we get to health:

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.636
We need to reverse the formula
for happiness and success.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.336
In the last three years,
I've traveled to 45 countries,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.836
working with schools and companies
in the midst of an economic downturn.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.936
And I found that
most companies and schools

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.032
follow a formula
for success, which is this:

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:31.132
If I work harder, I'll be more successful.

00:09:31.156 --> 00:09:33.536
And if I'm more successful,
then I'll be happier.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.336
That undergirds most
of our parenting and managing styles,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.236
the way that we motivate our behavior.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.880
And the problem is it's scientifically
broken and backwards for two reasons.

00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:43.636
Every time your brain has a success,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.436
you just changed the goalpost
of what success looked like.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.137
You got good grades,
now you have to get better grades,

00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:52.132
you got into a good school
and after you get into a better one,

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.733
you got a good job,
now you have to get a better job,

00:09:54.757 --> 00:09:57.234
you hit your sales target,
we're going to change it.

00:09:57.258 --> 00:10:01.135
And if happiness is on the opposite side
of success, your brain never gets there.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:04.236
We've pushed happiness
over the cognitive horizon, as a society.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.784
And that's because we think
we have to be successful,

00:10:06.808 --> 00:10:07.932
then we'll be happier.

00:10:07.956 --> 00:10:10.031
But our brains work in the opposite order.

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:13.032
If you can raise somebody's level
of positivity in the present,

00:10:13.056 --> 00:10:16.296
then their brain experiences what we now
call a happiness advantage,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.234
which is your brain at positive
performs significantly better

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:21.126
than at negative, neutral or stressed.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.580
Your intelligence rises, your creativity
rises, your energy levels rise.

00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:27.775
In fact, we've found that every single
business outcome improves.

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:29.928
Your brain at positive
is 31% more productive

00:10:29.952 --> 00:10:32.262
than your brain at negative,
neutral or stressed.

00:10:32.286 --> 00:10:33.662
You're 37% better at sales.

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:35.782
Doctors are 19 percent
faster, more accurate

00:10:35.806 --> 00:10:37.736
at coming up with the correct diagnosis

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.436
when positive instead
of negative, neutral or stressed.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.336
Which means we can reverse the formula.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.136
If we can find a way of becoming
positive in the present,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.208
then our brains work
even more successfully

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:50.136
as we're able to work harder,
faster and more intelligently.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.236
We need to be able to reverse this formula

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.236
so we can start to see what our brains
are actually capable of.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.536
Because dopamine, which floods
into your system when you're positive,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.624
has two functions.

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:01.625
Not only does it make you happier,

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.226
it turns on all of the learning
centers in your brain

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.827
allowing you to adapt
to the world in a different way.

00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:09.528
We've found there are ways
that you can train your brain

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:11.229
to be able to become more positive.

00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:14.223
In just a two-minute span of time
done for 21 days in a row,

00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:15.924
we can actually rewire your brain,

00:11:15.948 --> 00:11:19.825
allowing your brain to actually work
more optimistically and more successfully.

00:11:19.849 --> 00:11:21.726
We've done these things in research now

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.727
in every company that I've worked with,

00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:27.028
getting them to write down three new
things that they're grateful for

00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:29.339
for 21 days in a row,
three new things each day.

00:11:29.363 --> 00:11:30.530
And at the end of that,

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:32.431
their brain starts to retain a pattern

00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:35.932
of scanning the world not for
the negative, but for the positive first.

00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:39.533
Journaling about one positive experience
you've had over the past 24 hours

00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:41.116
allows your brain to relive it.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.797
Exercise teaches your brain
that your behavior matters.

00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:45.798
We find that meditation allows your brain

00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:48.399
to get over the cultural ADHD
that we've been creating

00:11:48.423 --> 00:11:50.300
by trying to do multiple tasks at once

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:52.801
and allows our brains
to focus on the task at hand.

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:56.102
And finally, random acts of kindness
are conscious acts of kindness.

00:11:56.126 --> 00:11:58.270
We get people,
when they open up their inbox,

00:11:58.294 --> 00:11:59.604
to write one positive email

00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.305
praising or thanking somebody
in their support network.

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:03.806
And by doing these activities

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.507
and by training your brain
just like we train our bodies,

00:12:06.531 --> 00:12:10.008
what we've found is we can reverse
the formula for happiness and success,

00:12:10.032 --> 00:12:12.735
and in doing so, not only create
ripples of positivity,

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:13.836
but a real revolution.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.936
Thank you very much.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960
(Applause)
