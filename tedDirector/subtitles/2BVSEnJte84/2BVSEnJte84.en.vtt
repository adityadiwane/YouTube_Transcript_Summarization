Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.450
I'm going to begin today with a story

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.475
and end with a revolution.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:18.834
(Laughter)

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:20.025
Are you ready?

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:21.209
Audience: Yes!

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.138
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:25.144
All my life I wanted to be an actress.

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:28.620
From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.644
and I wanted to be a part of it.

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:32.400
So, at the ripe age of 21,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.026
I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.212
in New York City,

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.404
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:40.719
as the next Meryl Streep.

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.611
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:44.643
(Laughter)

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.324
Now, it's important for this story
that you understand

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:49.349
that I was raised by a raging feminist.

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:51.279
I mean, just to give you some idea:

00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:54.860
when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with "The Sound of Music,"

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:57.312
and running around, singing,
"I am 16 going on 17,"

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:58.908
all day every day,

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:01.641
my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.436
and she said, "OK, look.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.496
I'm not going to say
that you can't sing that song,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.075
but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.118
the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces."

00:01:13.142 --> 00:01:15.220
(Laughter)

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:16.893
So that's where I come from.

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:19.284
So it just honestly never
even occurred to me

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:21.970
that I would be prevented
from doing anything in my life

00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:23.354
because I'm a woman.

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:24.529
OK. So I graduate.

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:27.327
And I start auditioning
and I get work, slowly.

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:30.595
But I just start noticing
that the parts available for women

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.329
are terrible.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:34.169
But, remember -- I came here

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.579
to play smart, willful,
complicated, interesting

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:40.644
complex, confident
female characters, right?

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:42.148
Like Meryl.

00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:43.580
And all of the sudden,

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:47.096
I am wrestling with 300 other
gorgeous, talented women

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.684
to play ...

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.708
"[Female] No dialogue.

00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:53.159
The character only needs
to stand on a balcony,

00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:55.821
look forlorn, and walk back
inside the house.

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:57.154
Only partial nudity."

00:01:57.178 --> 00:01:58.910
(Laughter)

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.934
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.968
Attractive, cute, and flirty,
she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.545
throughout the entire film."

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.060
"[Mom] A proper Southern belle
who is making peace with the fact

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:14.059
that her only purpose in life
is to tend to her husband."

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:18.273
"[Abby] Must be OK
with a tastefully shot gang rape,

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:20.931
along with performing 19th-century dance."

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.144
(Laughter)

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:25.499
Those are actual casting notices.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.910
And so I just mentioned this
to my agent one day,

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:31.651
I say, "I feel like I'm not really
going in for parts

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:34.134
that I'm actually excited about playing.

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:37.473
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know
what to do with you.

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:38.996
You're too smart for the parts

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.200
that are being written
for women in their 20s,

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:43.839
and you're not quite pretty enough
to be the hot one,

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.863
so I think you'll work when you're 35."

00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:47.318
(Laughter)

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:48.773
And I said, "Oh. That's funny.

00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:51.810
I always thought that when you were 35,
you were kind of, like,

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.201
over the hill as an actress,

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:56.001
that you were relegated to playing
20-year-olds' mothers."

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:57.395
And he said, "Yeah --

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.419
(Laughter)

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:01.548
It's just the way it is."

00:03:02.937 --> 00:03:05.345
So, maybe a year or so after this,

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.639
I'm having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:09.680
and we're talking about
how insane this is.

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:12.209
And we decide, you know what? No problem.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.794
We'll just make our own movie.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.692
And I'll write and then I'll write it
about two complex female characters.

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:18.866
So we do.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.369
We set out to make this movie,

00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:23.879
and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.503
the writer, directors, producers,

00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:27.087
and it's a film about two women.

00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.355
And so pretty soon,
we're sitting in the office

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.956
of a successful male producer,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.443
and he goes, "OK, girls.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:36.778
So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:38.697
a male producer onboard, right?

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:41.322
Just so that people
will trust you with their money."

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:45.294
Over and over again, people tell us,

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:48.301
"Yeah, but people don't really
want to see films about women,

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.020
so maybe you should think about
making something else.

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:52.813
It's just the way it is."

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:55.895
So we make the movie, anyway.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.168
We scrape together 80,000 dollars,

00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.572
and we make it, and it does so well.

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:03.865
It gets into tons of festivals
and we win a lot of awards

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.889
and it's big and exciting.

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.737
But these experiences I've had
just keep rubbing at me.

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.881
And so, I just start talking about them,

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:14.835
first, at Q and A's after
screenings of the film,

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.931
and then I get invited to be on panels
and talk at conferences.

00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:20.433
And the really amazing thing
is that, to begin with,

00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:22.183
when I'm just talking to audiences

00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:25.075
and other people, you know,
coming up in the film industry,

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.099
the universal reaction is,

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:30.106
"Oh my god! This is terrible.
What do we do about this?"

00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:33.187
But the bigger panels I get on,

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.909
suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:38.469
"Look, I totally agree
with everything you're saying.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.331
You just need to be really careful
about where you say it."

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.661
An Oscar-winning producer tells me

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:47.298
that she doesn't think it's a good idea
to play the woman card.

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:48.868
It's just the way it is.

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:54.421
And I think this is how
sexism continues on in 2016, right?

00:04:54.445 --> 00:04:57.231
For the most part, it happens casually --

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.928
unconsciously, even.

00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:01.548
It happens because people
are just trying to get along

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.097
within an existing system.

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:06.443
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:09.493
to teach a young woman
the way that the world "just is."

00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:13.017
The problem is that unless we do
something about it,

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:15.430
that is the way the world will always be.

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:18.460
So why should you care about this?

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.639
Right?

00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:22.898
I mean, we're facing some rather
significant problems in the world

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.074
just at present,

00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:26.437
what does it really matter
if I can't get a job,

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:28.784
or you're stuck watching
"Transformer 17," right?

00:05:28.808 --> 00:05:30.546
(Laughter)

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.887
Well, let me put it to you this way:

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.295
the year "Jaws" came out,

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.042
Americans suddenly started listing
"sharks" among their top 10 major fears.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.696
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
three million dollars

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.613
to have James Bond switch
from driving an Aston Martin

00:05:48.637 --> 00:05:50.257
to a BMW Z3.

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:55.671
That one move caused so many people
to go out and buy that car,

00:05:55.695 --> 00:06:00.780
that BMW made 240 million dollars
in pre-sales alone.

00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:04.012
The year that "Brave"
and "Hunger Games" came out,

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:07.453
female participation in archery
went up 105 percent.

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:10.365
(Laughter)

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:11.733
In fact, studies show

00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:15.464
that the movies you watch
don't just affect your hobbies,

00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:20.781
they affect your career choices,
your emotions, your sense of identity,

00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:24.789
your relationships, your mental health --
even your marital status.

00:06:25.924 --> 00:06:27.608
So now, consider this:

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.003
if you have watched
mostly American movies in your lifetime,

00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:36.951
95 percent of all the films
you have ever seen

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:38.722
were directed by men.

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:43.165
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
of all of the leading characters

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.334
that you have ever seen

00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:46.778
were men.

00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:49.781
And even if we just talk about
the last five years,

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:53.878
55 percent of the time
that you have seen a woman in a movie,

00:06:53.902 --> 00:06:56.519
she was naked or scantily clad.

00:06:57.804 --> 00:06:59.362
That affects you.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.546
That affects all of us.

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:04.986
We actually can't even imagine
how much it affects us,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.984
because this is all we've ever had.

00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:10.547
Stories -- and movies
are just modern stories --

00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:11.834
are not frivolous.

00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:15.324
They're actually the mechanism
through which we process

00:07:15.348 --> 00:07:17.482
our experience of being alive.

00:07:18.045 --> 00:07:20.175
They're the way
that we understand the world

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.631
and our place in it.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.427
They're the way we develop empathy

00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.418
for people who have experiences
different than our own.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.279
And right now, all of that
is being funneled at us

00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:33.006
through the prism of this one perspective.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.926
It's not that it's a bad perspective,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.000
but don't we deserve to hear them all?

00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:41.217
How would the world be different
if all of the stories were told?

00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:43.628
So what do we do about this?

00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:46.771
This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,

00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:50.299
but a lot of us within the film industry
have spent years --

00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:52.972
a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have --

00:07:52.996 --> 00:07:55.632
giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles

00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:56.810
and doing studies,

00:07:56.834 --> 00:08:00.903
and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.

00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:04.658
I mean, we have really yelled at them.

00:08:04.682 --> 00:08:08.681
And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:13.337
and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,

00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:16.780
not a single one
will be directed by a woman.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.590
So it is beginning to occur to me

00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:24.617
that waiting for Hollywood
to grow a conscience

00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:26.700
may not actually be a winning strategy.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.601
In fact, it seems to me

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.508
that whenever there is a small,
ruling class of people

00:08:31.532 --> 00:08:34.428
who have all of the money
and power and resources,

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:37.291
they're not actually that excited
about giving it up.

00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:40.653
And so you don't get change by asking them

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:42.250
or even yelling at them.

00:08:42.869 --> 00:08:44.827
You have to make that change happen

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:46.977
through a revolution.

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:52.269
Now, please don't worry --
I promise you, here, now, today,

00:08:52.293 --> 00:08:54.293
our body count will be very low.

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:56.546
(Laughter)

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.223
So, now before I get to my four-point
plan for the revolution --

00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:01.888
yes, I have a four-point plan --

00:09:01.912 --> 00:09:04.729
I have two pieces of very good
and important news for you.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:05.984
Good news number one:

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:08.341
there are female filmmakers.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:09.618
(Cheers and applause)

00:09:09.642 --> 00:09:11.069
Yes! I know!

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:12.250
(Applause)

00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.487
We exist!

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:16.558
We actually graduate from film schools

00:09:16.582 --> 00:09:18.905
at the same rate that men
do -- 50 percent.

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:21.227
So here we have our 50 women.

00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:24.438
The problem is that as soon as you get
to the micro-budget film,

00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:26.023
so even the very smallest films,

00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:28.767
we're already only directing 18 percent.

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.331
Then you get to slightly bigger films,

00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:34.486
indies in the $1-5 million budget range,

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.117
and we go down to 12 percent.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:38.644
So by the time you get
to the studio system,

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:40.779
we're only directing
five percent of movies.

00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:45.051
Now, I know some of you out there
will look at this

00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.958
and secretly think to yourselves,

00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:49.941
"Well, maybe women
just aren't as good at directing movies."

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.742
And that's not a totally insane question.

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:56.123
I mean, we like to believe
the film industry is a meritocracy, right?

00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:57.432
(Laughs)

00:09:57.456 --> 00:09:59.503
(Laughter)

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.275
But look at this trajectory.

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:02.662
Either you have to accept

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:06.937
that women are actually
five percent as talented as men,

00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:08.119
which I don't,

00:10:08.143 --> 00:10:11.163
or you have to accept
that there are serious systemic issues

00:10:11.187 --> 00:10:14.000
preventing us from getting
from here to there.

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:16.439
But the good news is, we exist,

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:19.898
and there is a vast amount
of untapped potential over here.

00:10:20.802 --> 00:10:24.498
Good news number two,
and this is really good news:

00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:29.345
films by and about women make more money.

00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:32.493
Yes! Yes! It's true!

00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:33.853
(Cheers and applause)

00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:35.521
It's true.

00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:37.864
The Washington Post
recently released a study

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:42.696
showing that films that feature women
make 23 cents more on every dollar

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.166
than films that don't.

00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:47.070
Furthermore, my colleagues and I
commissioned a study

00:10:47.094 --> 00:10:50.230
comparing 1,700 films
made over the last five years

00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:52.803
and, looking at the average
returns on investment --

00:10:52.827 --> 00:10:54.850
so, how much money does that movie make --

00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:58.224
comparing if a man or a woman
filled each of the following roles:

00:10:58.248 --> 00:11:01.313
director, producer,
screenwriter and lead actor.

00:11:01.884 --> 00:11:04.561
And in every single category,

00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:07.537
the return on investment is higher
if it's a woman.

00:11:08.797 --> 00:11:12.052
Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.

00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:15.475
Films by and about women make more money.

00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:18.869
And of course, at least
some portion of the male population

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:20.108
does also like women --

00:11:20.132 --> 00:11:23.257
(Laughter)

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:26.243
so "women films" are not just for women.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.868
And yet, Hollywood only targets
18 percent of all of their films

00:11:30.892 --> 00:11:32.574
as "women films."

00:11:32.598 --> 00:11:36.668
So what you're left with
is a giant underserved audience

00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:39.057
and untapped profit potential.

00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:43.897
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.

00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:46.309
We have so many stories to tell.

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:50.449
And despite everything we've heard:
you want to see them.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:55.103
The problem is, we've got this thing --
let's call it "Hollywood" --

00:11:55.127 --> 00:11:57.433
(Laughter)

00:11:57.457 --> 00:11:58.675
no, no, I'm just kidding;

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:01.006
I've met some very nice
people in Hollywood --

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.040
Hollywood, preventing us
from getting to you.

00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:06.352
So here is my four-point plan
for the revolution,

00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:09.746
and everybody -- man or woman,
in this room or anywhere in the world --

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.979
is going to get to help.

00:12:11.003 --> 00:12:13.619
And this revolution is not just for women.

00:12:13.643 --> 00:12:15.825
Anyone who has been disenfranchised,

00:12:15.849 --> 00:12:18.205
anyone whose story has not been told,

00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:20.064
the same principles apply,

00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:22.694
and I really hope we can do
the revolution together.

00:12:24.392 --> 00:12:25.610
My four-point plan.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.967
Number one: watch movies.

00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.475
Isn't this a good revolution?

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.569
(Laughter)

00:12:31.593 --> 00:12:34.152
OK, first I want to talk to anyone
who watches movies.

00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:35.810
Who watches movies in here?

00:12:35.834 --> 00:12:36.985
Great!

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:41.014
Will you pledge to watch one film
by a female filmmaker per month?

00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:43.109
That's it, just start there. Great!

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:44.699
If you need help finding them,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.660
you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:51.895
It's an easily searchable database
of films by women.

00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:55.115
And as you start watching all movies,

00:12:55.139 --> 00:12:57.987
I just want you to pay attention
to the female characters.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:12:59.308
How many of them are there?

00:12:59.332 --> 00:13:00.521
What are they wearing?

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:02.000
Or not?

00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:03.476
Do they get to do cool things,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.159
or are they just there
to emotionally support the men?

00:13:07.213 --> 00:13:10.904
I'm telling you, once you see this,
you're not going to be able to unsee it.

00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:14.510
And as you start noticing this,
it's going to shift your viewing habits.

00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:17.772
And this already sizable market
is going to continue to grow.

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:20.877
Step two: make movies.

00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:24.837
So now I'm talking to all
the female filmmakers out there:

00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:27.162
we need you to be very brave.

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.996
It will be harder for you to make movies.

00:13:30.614 --> 00:13:33.987
In fact, there will be an entire industry
constantly telling you

00:13:34.011 --> 00:13:35.677
that your stories don't matter.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.280
And we need you to make them, anyway.

00:13:38.724 --> 00:13:42.708
That 18 percent in the micro-budget
range -- that is on us to fix.

00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:45.134
Don't wait for permission.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.158
Don't wait for somebody to pick you,

00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:49.619
because 95 percent says
they are not going to.

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:51.424
Crowd fund.

00:13:51.448 --> 00:13:53.326
Write letters to eccentric relatives.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.716
I know how hard it is,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.428
but you have to make your movies --
now, today, features, not shorts.

00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:03.195
There is an audience for them,
and they want and need to see them.

00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.867
Three: invest in each other.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.858
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy

00:14:11.882 --> 00:14:13.945
on a system that does not want us.

00:14:13.969 --> 00:14:17.575
We need to find our audience
and invest in cultivating them.

00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:19.832
If we can figure out
how to make our movies

00:14:19.856 --> 00:14:22.340
and deliver them
to the audiences that want them,

00:14:22.364 --> 00:14:23.524
that's it.

00:14:23.548 --> 00:14:24.913
That's the whole game.

00:14:24.937 --> 00:14:26.903
And whatever they're doing in the middle

00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:29.198
is going to cease to be
quite so important.

00:14:29.222 --> 00:14:31.682
Audiences, invest in us.

00:14:32.293 --> 00:14:35.231
Help us make the movies
that you want to see.

00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:39.194
If you can give a female filmmaker
25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,

00:14:39.218 --> 00:14:40.494
great, do that.

00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:42.115
If you can invest more seriously

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:44.653
and help us over that critical
million-dollar hurdle,

00:14:44.677 --> 00:14:45.844
do that.

00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:48.607
But invest in seeing
the other half of the story.

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:52.682
Four: disrupt through business.

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:55.793
So now I'm talking
to all of the businesspeople

00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:57.125
and entrepreneurs.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:59.563
This does not happen
very often in the world,

00:14:59.587 --> 00:15:02.183
but right here we have a golden situation

00:15:02.207 --> 00:15:05.028
in which you can enact
significant social change

00:15:05.052 --> 00:15:07.052
while also making money.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.194
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.

00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:14.192
The old models of financing
and distribution are crumbling --

00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:16.269
please come in and disrupt it.

00:15:16.954 --> 00:15:18.594
I'll give you an example.

00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:20.568
Right now, with some incredible women,

00:15:20.592 --> 00:15:22.781
I am launching the "The 51 Fund."

00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:24.288
It's a venture capital fund

00:15:24.312 --> 00:15:27.639
that will finance films written, directed
and produced by women

00:15:27.663 --> 00:15:30.351
in that critical $1-5 million range.

00:15:31.057 --> 00:15:33.756
We will give a significant number
of female filmmakers

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.315
the chance to make their movies

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:38.074
and we will deliver them
to the audiences who want them.

00:15:38.098 --> 00:15:40.712
Good for equality, good for business.

00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:43.885
But that's only one example, we need more.

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.020
There is room for so many more.

00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:47.398
So I say to you:

00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:49.627
Hollywood is leaving money on the table.

00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:51.378
Come pick it up.

00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:56.743
(Applause)

00:15:56.767 --> 00:16:00.797
Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
but it is actually so doable.

00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:04.464
Entrenched systems don't change
because you ask the people in charge,

00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:07.724
they change because all of the people
who don't have what they want

00:16:07.748 --> 00:16:09.827
rise up and make that change happen.

00:16:10.391 --> 00:16:11.862
And don't you want to?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.631
I want to see what the other
51 percent of the population has to say.

00:16:17.337 --> 00:16:19.730
I want to watch movies
that teach me about people

00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:21.141
who are different than I am.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.698
I want to see women's bodies on film
that aren't perfect.

00:16:26.237 --> 00:16:28.500
I want to give our little boys the chance

00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:30.383
to empathize with female characters

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.738
so that they can become more whole men.

00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:35.510
And I definitely want
to give a little girl

00:16:35.534 --> 00:16:37.491
who may not have a real-life role model

00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:38.875
the chance to watch movies

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.672
and see women doing everything
she dreams of achieving.

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:45.217
This is not about
making one industry better.

00:16:45.724 --> 00:16:47.724
This is about making a better world.

00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:49.778
Will you help?

00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:52.645
The time for waiting is over.

00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:54.915
The time for the revolution is now.

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:59.658
(Cheers and applause)
