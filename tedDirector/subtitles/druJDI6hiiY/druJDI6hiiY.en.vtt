00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.096
The word concussion evokes a fear
these days more so than it ever has,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.496
and I know this personally.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.176
I played 10 years of football,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.616
was struck in the head thousands of times.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.296
And I have to tell you, though,
what was much worse than that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.096
was a pair of bike accidents I had
where I suffered concussions,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.056
and I'm still dealing with the effects
of the most recent one

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.840
today as I stand in front of you.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.096
There is a fear around concussion

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.080
that does have some evidence behind it.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.936
There is information
that a repeated history of concussion

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.256
can lead to early dementia,
such as Alzheimer's,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.336
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.400
That was the subject
of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.136
And so everybody is caught up in football
and what they see in the military,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.496
but you may not know

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.816
that bike riding is the leading cause
of concussion for kids,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.507
sports-related concussion, that is.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.616
And so another thing
that I should tell you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.856
that you may not know

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.816
is that the helmets that are worn
in bicycling and football

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.496
and many activities,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.096
they're not designed or tested

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.600
for how well they can protect
your children against concussion.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.936
They're in fact designed and tested

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.640
for their ability to protect
against skull fracture.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.456
And so I get this question
all the time from parents,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.056
and they ask me,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.376
"Would you let your own child
play football?"

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.576
Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.496
And I think that as a field,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.920
we're a long way from giving an answer
with any kind of confidence there.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.016
So I look at that question
from a bit of a different lens,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.776
and I want to know,
how can we prevent concussion?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.456
Is that even possible?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.040
And most experts think that it's not,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.736
but the work that we're doing in my lab

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.136
is starting to reveal more
of the details around concussion

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.936
so that we can have
a better understanding.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.816
The reason we're able
to prevent skull fracture with helmets

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.295
is because it's pretty simple.
We know how it works.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.360
Concussion has been
much more of a mystery.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.040
So to give you a sense of what might
be happening in a concussion,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.176
I want to show you the video here

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.736
that you see when you type into Google,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.176
"What is a concussion?"

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.856
The CDC website comes up,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.336
and this video essentially
tells the whole story.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.776
What you see is the head moves forward,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.856
the brain lags behind,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.296
then the brain catches up

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.576
and smashes into the skull.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.776
It rebounds off the skull

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.560
and then proceeds to run
into the other side of the skull.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.936
And what you'll notice is highlighted
in this video from the CDC,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.416
which I'll note was funded by the NFL,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.376
is that the outer surface of the brain,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.696
where it was to have
smashed into the skull,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.656
looks like it's been damaged or injured,
so it's on the outer surface of the brain.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.656
And what I'd like to do with this video

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.376
is to tell you that there are
some aspects that are probably right,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.416
indicative of what the scientists
think happens with concussion,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.056
but there's probably more
that's wrong with this video.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.336
So one thing that I do agree with,
and I think most experts would,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.376
is that the brain
does have these dynamics.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.776
It does lag behind the skull

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.456
and then catch up and move
back and forth and oscillate.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.720
That we think is true.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.056
However, the amount of motion
you see in the brain in this video

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.656
is probably not right at all.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.096
There's very little room
in the cranial vault,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.816
only a few millimeters,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.016
and it's filled entirely
with cerebral spinal fluid,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.216
which acts as a protective layer.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.400
And so the brain as a whole probably
moves very little inside the skull.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.576
The other problem with this video

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.336
is that the brain is shown

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.456
as a kind of rigid whole
as it moves around,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880
and that's not true either.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.136
Your brain is one of the softest
substances in your body,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.176
and you can think of it
kind of like jello.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.336
So as your head is moving back and forth,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.216
your brain is twisting
and turning and contorting,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.456
and the tissue is getting stretched.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.496
And so most experts, I think, would agree

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.656
that concussion is not likely
to be something that's happening

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.496
on this outer surface of the brain,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.616
but rather it's something
that's much deeper

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.200
towards the center of the brain.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.856
Now, the way that we're
approaching this problem

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.216
to try to understand
the mechanisms of concussion

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.096
and to figure out if we can prevent it

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.936
is we are using a device like this.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.160
It's a mouthguard.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.856
It has sensors in it
that are essentially the same

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.216
that are in your cell phone:

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.576
accelerometers, gyroscopes,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.496
and when someone is struck in the head,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.056
it can tell you how their head moved

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.200
at a thousand samples per second.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.456
The principle behind
the mouthguard is this:

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.736
it fits onto your teeth.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.816
Your teeth are one of the hardest
substances in your body.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.896
So it rigidly couples to your skull

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.336
and gives you the most precise
possible measurement

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.296
of how the skull moves.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.856
People have tried
other approaches, with helmets.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.256
We've looked at other sensors
that go on your skin,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.896
and they all simply move around too much,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.616
and so we found that this
is the only reliable way

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.000
to take a good measurement.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.696
So now that we've got this device,
we can go beyond studying cadavers,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.136
because you can only
learn so much about concussion

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.376
from studying a cadaver,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.176
and we want to learn
and study live humans.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.096
So where can we find
a group of willing volunteers

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.376
to go out and smash their heads
into each other on a regular basis

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.616
and sustain concussion?

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.536
Well, I was one of them,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.360
and it's your local friendly
Stanford football team.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.256
So this is our laboratory,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.976
and I want to show you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.176
the first concussion
we measured with this device.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.456
One of the things that I should point out
is the device has this gyroscope in it,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.216
and that allows you
to measure the rotation of the head.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.616
Most experts think
that that's the critical factor

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.496
that might start to tell us
what is happening in concussion.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.880
So please watch this video.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.696
Announcer: Cougars bring
extra people late, but Luck has time,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.360
and Winslow is crushed.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.696
I hope he's all right.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.680
(Audience roars)

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.016
Top of your screen,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.456
you'll see him come on
just this little post route,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.120
get separation, safety.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.800
Here it comes at you in real speed.
You'll hear this.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.520
The hit delivered by --

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.176
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times
is probably a little excessive there.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.456
But you get the idea.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.296
So when you look at just the film here,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.136
pretty much the only thing you can see
is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.816
But when we extract the data

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.840
out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,

00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:05.576
we can see much more detail,
much richer information.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.016
And one of the things that we noticed here

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.096
is that he was struck
in the lower left side of his face mask.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.296
And so that did something first
that was a little counterintuitive.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.016
His head did not move to the right.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.976
In fact, it rotated first to the left.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.856
Then as the neck began to compress,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.976
the force of the blow caused it
to whip back to the right.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.856
So this left-right motion
was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.296
and we think that is probably
what led to the brain injury.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.096
Now, this device is only limited in such
that it can measure the skull motion,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.536
but what we really want to know
is what's happening inside of the brain.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.056
So we collaborate with
Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.656
They've developed a finite element
model of the brain.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.776
And so this is a simulation

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.136
using the data from our mouthguard
from the injury I just showed you,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.176
and what you see is the brain --

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.616
this is a cross-section right in the front

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.416
of the brain twisting
and contorting as I mentioned.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.336
So you can see this doesn't
look a lot like the CDC video.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.216
Now, the colors that you're looking at

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.376
are how much the brain tissue
is being stretched.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.096
And so the red is 50 percent.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.776
That means the brain has been stretched
to 50 percent of its original length,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.496
the tissue in that particular area.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.776
And the main thing I want to draw
your attention to is this red spot.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.256
So the red spot is very close
to the center of the brain,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.536
and relatively speaking,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.216
you don't see a lot of colors like that
on the exterior surface

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.600
as the CDC video showed.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.696
Now, to explain a little more detail

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.336
about how we think
concussion might be happening,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.656
one thing I should mention

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.895
is that we and others have observed
that a concussion is more likely

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.895
when you're struck and your head
rotates in this direction.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:51.176
This is more common
in sports like football,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.535
but this seems to be more dangerous.
So what might be happening there?

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:57.576
Well, one thing that you'll notice
in the human brain

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.336
that is different than other animals

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.816
is we have these two very large lobes.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.056
We have the right brain
and the left brain.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.136
And the key thing
to notice in this figure here

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.416
is that right down the center
of the right brain and the left brain

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.376
there's a large fissure
that goes deep into the brain.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.256
And in that fissure,
what you can't see in this image,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.496
you'll have to trust me,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.216
there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.456
It's called the falx,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.136
and it runs from the front of your head
all the way to the back of your head,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.376
and it's quite stiff.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.856
And so what that allows for
is when you're struck

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.936
and your head rotates
in this left-right direction,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.736
forces can rapidly transmit
right down to the center of your brain.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.000
Now, what's there
at the bottom of this fissure?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.616
It's the wiring of your brain,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.256
and in fact this red bundle
here at the bottom of that fissure

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.256
is the single largest fiber bundle

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.256
that is the wiring that connects
the right and left sides of your brain.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.804
It's called the corpus callosum.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.416
And we think that this might be

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.256
one of the most common
mechanisms of concussion,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.976
and as the forces move down,
they strike the corpus callosum,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.976
it causes a dissociation
between your right and your left brain

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.480
and could explain some
of the symptoms of concussion.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.496
This finding is also consistent
of what we've seen

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.536
in this brain disease that I mentioned,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.096
So this is an image of a middle-aged
ex-professional football player,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.096
and the thing that I want to point out
is if you look at the corpus callosum,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.056
and I'll page back here so you can see
the size of a normal corpus callosum

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.496
and the size of the person here
who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.056
it is greatly atrophied.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.416
And the same goes
for all of the space in the ventricles.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.216
These ventricles are much larger.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.776
And so all of this tissue
near the center of the brain

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.016
has died off over time.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.600
So what we're learning
is indeed consistent.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.176
Now, there is some good news here,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.656
and I hope to give you a sense
of hope by the end of this talk.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.776
One of the things that we've noticed,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.056
specifically about
this mechanism of injury,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.136
is although there's a rapid transmission
of the forces down this fissure,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.456
it still takes a defined amount of time.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.816
And what we think is that if we can
slow the head down just enough

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.056
so that the brain
does not lag behind the skull

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.656
but instead it moves
in synchrony with the skull,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.936
then we might be able to prevent
this mechanism of concussion.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.640
So how can we slow the head down?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.376
(Laughter)

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.360
A gigantic helmet.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.296
So with more space, you have more time,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.416
and this is a bit of a joke,
but some of you may have seen this.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.736
This is bubble soccer,
and it's a real sport.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.416
In fact, I saw some young adults

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.416
playing this sport down the street
from my house the other day,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.336
and as far as I know
there have been no reported concussions.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.376
(Laughter)

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.816
But in all seriousness,
this principle does work,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.216
but this has gone too far.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.496
This isn't something that's practical
for bike riding or playing football.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.896
And so we are collaborating
with a company in Sweden called Hövding.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.256
Some of you may have seen their work,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.656
and they're using the same principle
of air to give you some extra space

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.480
to prevent concussion.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080
Kids, don't try this at home please.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.840
This stuntman does not have a helmet.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.456
He instead has a neck collar,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.056
and this neck collar has sensors in it,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.656
the same type of sensors
that are in our mouthguard,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.816
and it detects when he's likely
to have a fall,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.176
and there's an airbag
that explodes and triggers,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.976
the same way that an airbag
works in your car, essentially.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.936
And in the experiments
we've done in my lab with their device,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.696
we found that it can greatly reduce
the risk of concussion in some scenarios

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.856
compared to a normal bicycle helmet.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.720
So it's a pretty exciting development.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.416
But in order for us to actually realize
the benefits of technology

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.296
that can prevent concussion,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.256
it needs to meet regulations.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.976
That's a reality.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.136
And this device is for sale in Europe

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.856
but is not for sale in the US,
and probably won't be any time soon.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.416
So I wanted to tell you why.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.216
There are some good reasons and then
there are some not so good reasons.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.456
Bike helmets are federally regulated.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.216
The Consumer Product Safety Commission
has been given jurisdiction

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.096
to approve any bike helmet for sale,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.576
and this is the test they use.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.256
This is back to what I was telling you
at the beginning about skull fracture.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.696
That's what this test is for.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.456
And that's an important thing to do.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.336
It can save your life,
but it's not sufficient, I would say.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.096
So for example, one thing
this test doesn't evaluate

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.936
is it doesn't tell you
is that airbag going to trigger

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.856
at the right time and place,
and not trigger when it doesn't need to?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.936
Similarly, it's not going to tell you

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.336
is this helmet likely
to prevent concussion or not?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.096
And if you look at football helmets,
which aren't regulated,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.496
they still have a very similar test.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.776
They're not regulated
by the government, anyway.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.936
They have an industry body,
which is the way most industries work.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.976
But this industry body, I can tell you,
has been quite resistant

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.376
to updating their standards.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.656
So in my lab, we are working on not only
the mechanism of concussion,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.136
but we want to understand
how can we have better test standards?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.696
And we hope that the government
can use this type of information

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.456
to encourage innovation

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.096
by letting consumers know

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.896
how protected are you with a given helmet.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.296
And I want to bring this back finally
to the original question I asked,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.656
which is, would I feel comfortable
letting my child play football

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.416
or ride a bicycle?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.776
And this might be just a result
of my own traumatic experience.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.800
I'm much more nervous
about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.576
So she's a year and a half old,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.056
and she's already, well, wants to anyway,
race down the streets of San Francisco.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.416
This is the bottom
of one of these streets.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.656
And so my personal goal
is to -- and I believe this is possible --

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.736
is to further develop these technologies,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.736
and in fact, we're working
on something in my lab in particular

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.713
that really makes optimal use
of the given space of a helmet.

00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:08.216
And I am confident
that we will be able to,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.456
before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.856
have something available

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.216
that can in fact really reduce
the risk of concussion

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.376
and comply with regulatory bodies.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.016
And so what I'd like to do --

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.416
and I know that this is for some of you
of more immediate nature,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.096
I've got a couple years here --

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.256
is to be able to tell parents
and grandparents when I'm asked,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.696
it is safe and healthy for your children
to engage in these activities.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.536
And I'm very fortunate
to have a wonderful team at Stanford

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.456
that's working hard on this.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.576
So I hope to come back in a few years
with the final story,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.576
but for now I will tell you,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.536
please don't just be afraid
when you hear the word concussion.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.776
There is hope.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.016
Thank you.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.543
(Applause)
