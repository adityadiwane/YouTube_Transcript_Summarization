00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:16.643
One hot October morning,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.377
I got off the all-night train

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.559
in Mandalay,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.701
the old royal capital of Burma,

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:25.142
now Myanmar.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.858
And out on the street, I ran into
a group of rough men

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:33.775
standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.169
And one of them came up

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:37.375
and offered to show me around.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.279
The price he quoted was outrageous.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:45.820
It was less than I would pay
for a bar of chocolate at home.

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:48.985
So I clambered into his trishaw,

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:54.880
and he began pedaling us slowly
between palaces and pagodas.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:01:01.271
And as he did, he told me how
he had come to the city from his village.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.674
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.025
His dream was to be a teacher.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:11.257
But of course, life is hard
under a military dictatorship,

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:15.401
and so for now, this was the only way
he could make a living.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:20.737
Many nights, he told me,
he actually slept in his trishaw

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:25.147
so he could catch the first visitors
off the all-night train.

00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:31.392
And very soon, we found
that in certain ways,

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:33.082
we had so much in common --

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:34.967
we were both in our 20s,

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.203
we were both fascinated
by foreign cultures --

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.658
that he invited me home.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:45.863
So we turned off the wide,
crowded streets,

00:01:45.887 --> 00:01:50.097
and we began bumping
down rough, wild alleyways.

00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:52.469
There were broken shacks all around.

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:55.335
I really lost the sense of where I was,

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:59.818
and I realized that anything
could happen to me now.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:02.284
I could get mugged or drugged

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:03.624
or something worse.

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:05.032
Nobody would know.

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:10.006
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.354
which consisted of just one tiny room.

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:16.405
And then he leaned down,

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.371
and reached under his bed.

00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:21.786
And something in me froze.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.746
I waited to see what he would pull out.

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:30.371
And finally he extracted a box.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:36.226
Inside it was every single letter
he had ever received

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.291
from visitors from abroad,

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.103
and on some of them he had pasted

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:44.518
little black-and-white worn snapshots

00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:46.746
of his new foreign friends.

00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:52.014
So when we said goodbye that night,

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.625
I realized he had also shown me

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.959
the secret point of travel,

00:02:56.983 --> 00:02:59.039
which is to take a plunge,

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:01.755
to go inwardly as well as outwardly

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.294
to places you would never go otherwise,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.498
to venture into uncertainty,

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:09.101
ambiguity,

00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:10.780
even fear.

00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:14.737
At home, it's dangerously easy

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.971
to assume we're on top of things.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.822
Out in the world, you are reminded
every moment that you're not,

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.855
and you can't get to the bottom
of things, either.

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:29.137
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,"

00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:31.440
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:34.140
"but only insofar
as we are unsettled

00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:35.850
is there any hope for us."

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:39.318
At this conference,
we've been lucky enough

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:42.795
to hear some exhilarating
new ideas and discoveries

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.575
and, really, about all the ways

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.922
in which knowledge is being
pushed excitingly forwards.

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:52.026
But at some point, knowledge gives out.

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:54.026
And that is the moment

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.685
when your life is truly decided:

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.507
you fall in love;

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.928
you lose a friend;

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:04.465
the lights go out.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.014
And it's then, when you're lost
or uneasy or carried out of yourself,

00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:12.200
that you find out who you are.

00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:17.552
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:21.324
Science has unquestionably made our lives

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:23.816
brighter and longer and healthier.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:29.652
And I am forever grateful to the teachers
who showed me the laws of physics

00:04:29.676 --> 00:04:33.189
and pointed out that
three times three makes nine.

00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:36.503
I can count that out on my fingers

00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:38.869
any time of night or day.

00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:42.414
But when a mathematician tells me

00:04:42.438 --> 00:04:45.961
that minus three times
minus three makes nine,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:50.854
that's a kind of logic
that almost feels like trust.

00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:56.435
The opposite of knowledge, in other words,
isn't always ignorance.

00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:58.098
It can be wonder.

00:04:58.482 --> 00:04:59.632
Or mystery.

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:01.147
Possibility.

00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:05.731
And in my life, I've found
it's the things I don't know

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:08.434
that have lifted me up
and pushed me forwards

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:11.026
much more than the things I do know.

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:14.021
It's also the things I don't know

00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:17.439
that have often brought me closer
to everybody around me.

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.549
For eight straight Novembers, recently,

00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:25.001
I traveled every year across Japan
with the Dalai Lama.

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.101
And the one thing he said every day

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.672
that most seemed to give people
reassurance and confidence

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:34.754
was, "I don't know."

00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:38.202
"What's going to happen to Tibet?"

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:42.206
"When are we ever
going to get world peace?"

00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:44.826
"What's the best way to raise children?"

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:49.205
"Frankly," says this very wise man,

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.466
"I don't know."

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:55.818
The Nobel Prize-winning
economist Daniel Kahneman

00:05:55.842 --> 00:06:00.345
has spent more than 60 years now
researching human behavior,

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.401
and his conclusion is

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:07.039
that we are always much more confident
of what we think we know

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:08.788
than we should be.

00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:11.471
We have, as he memorably puts it,

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:15.699
an "unlimited ability
to ignore our ignorance."

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.936
We know -- quote, unquote -- our team
is going to win this weekend,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.129
and we only remember that knowledge

00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:26.502
on the rare occasions when we're right.

00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:30.425
Most of the time, we're in the dark.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.794
And that's where real intimacy lies.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.513
Do you know what your lover
is going to do tomorrow?

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:41.946
Do you want to know?

00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:46.434
The parents of us all,
as some people call them,

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.617
Adam and Eve,

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:51.799
could never die, so long as they
were eating from the tree of life.

00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.829
But the minute they began nibbling

00:06:54.853 --> 00:06:57.435
from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.263
they fell from their innocence.

00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:02.833
They grew embarrassed and fretful,

00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:04.054
self-conscious.

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:07.233
And they learned,
a little too late, perhaps,

00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:09.997
that there are certainly some things
that we need to know,

00:07:10.021 --> 00:07:13.968
but there are many, many more
that are better left unexplored.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.924
Now, when I was a kid,

00:07:17.948 --> 00:07:21.266
I knew it all, of course.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.502
I had been spending 20 years
in classrooms collecting facts,

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:28.245
and I was actually
in the information business,

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.419
writing articles for Time Magazine.

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:36.305
And I took my first real trip to Japan
for two-and-a-half weeks,

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:39.609
and I came back with a 40-page essay

00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:43.197
explaining every last detail
about Japan's temples,

00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:45.903
its fashions, its baseball games,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.649
its soul.

00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:51.606
But underneath all that,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.807
something that I couldn't understand

00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.325
so moved me for reasons
I couldn't explain to you yet,

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:03.296
that I decided to go and live in Japan.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.201
And now that I've been there for 28 years,

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:09.625
I really couldn't tell you
very much at all

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.313
about my adopted home.

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:13.569
Which is wonderful,

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:16.473
because it means every day
I'm making some new discovery,

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:17.988
and in the process,

00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:21.906
looking around the corner
and seeing the hundred thousand things

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.231
I'll never know.

00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:27.430
Knowledge is a priceless gift.

00:08:28.452 --> 00:08:33.007
But the illusion of knowledge
can be more dangerous than ignorance.

00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:36.528
Thinking that you know your lover

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:38.272
or your enemy

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:40.076
can be more treacherous

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.548
than acknowledging you'll never know them.

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:48.409
Every morning in Japan, as the sun
is flooding into our little apartment,

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:52.791
I take great pains not to consult
the weather forecast,

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:54.453
because if I do,

00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:57.740
my mind will be overclouded, distracted,

00:08:57.764 --> 00:09:00.278
even when the day is bright.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.353
I've been a full-time
writer now for 34 years.

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:09.696
And the one thing that I have learned

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.256
is that transformation comes
when I'm not in charge,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.457
when I don't know what's coming next,

00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.008
when I can't assume I am bigger
than everything around me.

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:23.097
And the same is true in love

00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:25.919
or in moments of crisis.

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:30.371
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:34.430
and we're bumping off the broad,
well-lit streets;

00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:38.118
and we're reminded, really,
of the first law of travel

00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:39.868
and, therefore, of life:

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.829
you're only as strong
as your readiness to surrender.

00:09:47.512 --> 00:09:49.521
In the end, perhaps,

00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:50.739
being human

00:09:51.262 --> 00:09:53.015
is much more important

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:55.694
than being fully in the know.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:57.949
Thank you.

00:09:57.973 --> 00:10:04.596
(Applause)
