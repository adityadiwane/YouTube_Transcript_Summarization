00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:18.858
Hi.

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:20.959
Thank you.

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:22.680
[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:25.849
The live audience was asked
to applaud ASL-style, in silence.]

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:29.240
So, five years ago, this was me.

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:31.752
I was a PhD student at Harvard,

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:33.809
and I loved to travel.

00:00:34.472 --> 00:00:37.652
I had just gotten engaged
to marry the love of my life.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:43.047
I was 28, and like so many of us
when we are in good health,

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.102
I felt like I was invincible.

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:50.147
Then one day I had
a fever of 104.7 degrees.

00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:52.807
I probably should have gone to the doctor,

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.395
but I'd never really been sick in my life,

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.772
and I knew that usually,
if you have a virus,

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:00.929
you stay home and you make
some chicken soup,

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.266
and in a few days,
everything will be fine.

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:06.336
But this time it wasn't fine.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.097
After the fever broke,

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.972
for three weeks I was so dizzy,
I couldn't leave my house.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.661
I would walk straight into door frames.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:19.295
I had to hug the walls
just to make it to the bathroom.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.270
That spring I got infection
after infection,

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:25.652
and every time I went to the doctor,

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:28.459
he said there was absolutely
nothing wrong.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.158
He had his laboratory tests,

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:33.086
which always came back normal.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.842
All I had were my symptoms,

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.796
which I could describe,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.512
but no one else can see.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.593
I know it sounds silly,

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:45.885
but you have to find a way
to explain things like this to yourself,

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.533
and so I thought maybe I was just aging.

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:53.667
Maybe this is what it's like
to be on the other side of 25.

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.983
(Laughter)

00:01:56.808 --> 00:01:58.976
Then the neurological symptoms started.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.301
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't
draw the right side of a circle.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.631
Other times I wouldn't be able
to speak or move at all.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.064
I saw every kind of specialist:

00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:15.160
infectious disease doctors,
dermatologists, endocrinologists,

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:16.467
cardiologists.

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:18.861
I even saw a psychiatrist.

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.923
My psychiatrist said,
"It's clear you're really sick,

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.103
but not with anything psychiatric.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.783
I hope they can find out
what's wrong with you."

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:34.160
The next day, my neurologist
diagnosed me with conversion disorder.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.525
He told me that everything --

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.232
the fevers, the sore throats,
the sinus infection,

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:44.246
all of the gastrointestinal,
neurological and cardiac symptoms --

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:47.433
were being caused
by some distant emotional trauma

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:49.063
that I could not remember.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.067
The symptoms were real, he said,

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:54.905
but they had no biological cause.

00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:59.136
I was training to be a social scientist.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.392
I had studied statistics,
probability theory,

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.990
mathematical modeling,
experimental design.

00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:11.051
I felt like I couldn't just reject
my neurologist's diagnosis.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.191
It didn't feel true,

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.685
but I knew from my training
that the truth is often counterintuitive,

00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:19.953
so easily obscured
by what we want to believe.

00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:23.446
So I had to consider the possibility
that he was right.

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:28.118
That day, I ran a small experiment.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.332
I walked back the two miles
from my neurologist's office to my house,

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.264
my legs wrapped in this strange,
almost electric kind of pain.

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:40.078
I meditated on that pain,

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:44.121
contemplating how my mind
could have possibly generated all this.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.195
As soon as I walked through the door,

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.384
I collapsed.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:51.619
My brain and my spinal cord were burning.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:56.467
My neck was so stiff
I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,

00:03:57.324 --> 00:03:59.075
and the slightest sound --

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.934
the rustling of the sheets,

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.223
my husband walking barefoot
in the next room --

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:05.871
could cause excruciating pain.

00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:10.415
I would spend most
of the next two years in bed.

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:13.995
How could my doctor
have gotten it so wrong?

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.120
I thought I had a rare disease,

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:19.133
something doctors had never seen.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.121
And then I went online

00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:23.523
and found thousands of people
all over the world

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.600
living with the same symptoms,

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:27.651
similarly isolated,

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.132
similarly disbelieved.

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.137
Some could still work,

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:33.646
but had to spend their evenings
and weekends in bed,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.737
just so they could show up
the next Monday.

00:04:36.364 --> 00:04:38.444
On the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:40.206
some were so sick

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.536
they had to live in complete darkness,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.932
unable to tolerate
the sound of a human voice

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:47.865
or the touch of a loved one.

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.471
I was diagnosed
with myalgic encephalomyelitis.

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:58.006
You've probably heard it called
"chronic fatigue syndrome."

00:04:58.987 --> 00:05:00.909
For decades, that's a name

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.538
that's meant that this

00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:04.961
has been the dominant image

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:08.260
of a disease that can be
as serious as this.

00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:10.992
The key symptom we all share

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:14.768
is that whenever we exert ourselves --
physically, mentally --

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:17.249
we pay and we pay hard.

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:21.301
If my husband goes for a run,
he might be sore for a couple of days.

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:24.724
If I try to walk half a block,
I might be bedridden for a week.

00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:27.578
It is a perfect custom prison.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.009
I know ballet dancers who can't dance,

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.206
accountants who can't add,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.788
medical students who never became doctors.

00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:38.589
It doesn't matter what you once were;

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.846
you can't do it anymore.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.365
It's been four years,

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.985
and I've still never been as well as I was

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.485
the minute before I walked home
from my neurologist's office.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.878
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million
people around the world

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:55.156
have this disease.

00:05:55.604 --> 00:05:58.867
In the US, where I'm from,
it's about one million people.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.523
That makes it roughly twice as common
as multiple sclerosis.

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:06.539
Patients can live for decades
with the physical function

00:06:06.563 --> 00:06:08.697
of someone with congestive heart failure.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.348
Twenty-five percent of us
are homebound or bedridden,

00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:16.628
and 75 to 85 percent of us
can't even work part-time.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.389
Yet doctors do not treat us

00:06:20.064 --> 00:06:22.002
and science does not study us.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.544
How could a disease this common
and this devastating

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:29.150
have been forgotten by medicine?

00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:33.788
When my doctor diagnosed me
with conversion disorder,

00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:36.500
he was invoking a lineage
of ideas about women's bodies

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:38.674
that are over 2,500 years old.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:40.948
The Roman physician Galen thought

00:06:40.972 --> 00:06:43.943
that hysteria was caused
by sexual deprivation

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:46.492
in particularly passionate women.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:49.889
The Greeks thought the uterus
would literally dry up

00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:52.340
and wander around the body
in search of moisture,

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:54.260
pressing on internal organs --

00:06:54.284 --> 00:06:55.498
yes --

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:59.343
causing symptoms from extreme emotions

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.612
to dizziness and paralysis.

00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:05.319
The cure was marriage and motherhood.

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:11.458
These ideas went largely unchanged
for several millennia until the 1880s,

00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:15.180
when neurologists tried to modernize
the theory of hysteria.

00:07:15.764 --> 00:07:17.417
Sigmund Freud developed a theory

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:20.237
that the unconscious mind
could produce physical symptoms

00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.276
when dealing with memories or emotions

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.611
too painful for the conscious
mind to handle.

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:27.514
It converted these emotions
into physical symptoms.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.656
This meant that men
could now get hysteria,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.178
but of course women were still
the most susceptible.

00:07:35.448 --> 00:07:39.065
When I began investigating
the history of my own disease,

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:42.134
I was amazed to find how deep
these ideas still run.

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.197
In 1934,

00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:48.996
198 doctors, nurses and staff
at the Los Angeles County General Hospital

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.561
became seriously ill.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:54.996
They had muscle weakness, stiffness
in the neck and back, fevers --

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.374
all of the same symptoms
I had when I first got diagnosed.

00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.247
Doctors thought
it was a new form of polio.

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:05.064
Since then, there have been more
than 70 outbreaks documented

00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:06.249
around the world,

00:08:06.273 --> 00:08:08.711
of a strikingly similar
post-infectious disease.

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.912
All of these outbreaks have tended
to disproportionately affect women,

00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:17.409
and in time, when doctors failed to find
the one cause of the disease,

00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:20.572
they thought that these outbreaks
were mass hysteria.

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:24.020
Why has this idea had such staying power?

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:27.363
I do think it has to do with sexism,

00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:30.828
but I also think that fundamentally,
doctors want to help.

00:08:30.852 --> 00:08:32.622
They want to know the answer,

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:37.537
and this category allows doctors to treat
what would otherwise be untreatable,

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.366
to explain illnesses
that have no explanation.

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:43.771
The problem is that this
can cause real harm.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:47.978
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist
named Eliot Slater

00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:52.186
studied a cohort of 85 patients
who had been diagnosed with hysteria.

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:56.763
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead
and 30 had become disabled.

00:08:56.787 --> 00:09:00.220
Many had undiagnosed conditions
like multiple sclerosis,

00:09:00.244 --> 00:09:02.140
epilepsy, brain tumors.

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:06.984
In 1980, hysteria was officially
renamed "conversion disorder."

00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:10.887
When my neurologist gave me
that diagnosis in 2012,

00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:13.528
he was echoing Freud's words verbatim,

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:14.703
and even today,

00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:19.101
women are 2 to 10 times more likely
to receive that diagnosis.

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:24.486
The problem with the theory of hysteria
or psychogenic illness

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.544
is that it can never be proven.

00:09:26.568 --> 00:09:29.423
It is by definition
the absence of evidence,

00:09:30.192 --> 00:09:31.567
and in the case of ME,

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.596
psychological explanations
have held back biological research.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.919
All around the world, ME is one
of the least funded diseases.

00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:46.263
In the US, we spend each year
roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:49.529
250 dollars per MS patient

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.307
and just 5 dollars per year
per ME patient.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.206
This was not just lightning.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.994
I was not just unlucky.

00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:01.585
The ignorance surrounding my disease
has been a choice,

00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:05.733
a choice made by the institutions
that were supposed to protect us.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:10.406
We don't know why ME
sometimes runs in families,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.895
why you can get it
after almost any infection,

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:16.652
from enteroviruses
to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,

00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:20.363
or why it affects women
at two to three times the rate of men.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:23.777
This issue is much bigger
than just my disease.

00:10:24.356 --> 00:10:25.539
When I first got sick,

00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.721
old friends were reaching out to me.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.309
I soon found myself a part
of a cohort of women in their late 20s

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.019
whose bodies were falling apart.

00:10:34.012 --> 00:10:36.867
What was striking was just how
much trouble we were having

00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:38.049
being taken seriously.

00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.535
I learned of one woman with scleroderma,

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.659
an autoimmune connective tissue disease,

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:45.393
who was told for years
that it was all in her head.

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:47.929
Between the time of onset and diagnosis,

00:10:47.953 --> 00:10:50.380
her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,

00:10:50.404 --> 00:10:52.649
she will never be able to eat again.

00:10:52.673 --> 00:10:54.855
Another woman with ovarian cancer,

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:58.124
who for years was told
that it was just early menopause.

00:10:59.188 --> 00:11:00.756
A friend from college,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.675
whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed
for years as anxiety.

00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:07.832
Here's why this worries me:

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:12.576
since the 1950s, rates of many
autoimmune diseases

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.303
have doubled to tripled.

00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:17.758
Forty-five percent of patients
who are eventually diagnosed

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.776
with a recognized autoimmune disease

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.308
are initially told they're hypochondriacs.

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.933
Like the hysteria of old,
this has everything to do with gender

00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:27.823
and with whose stories we believe.

00:11:28.974 --> 00:11:32.625
Seventy-five percent
of autoimmune disease patients are women,

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.828
and in some diseases,
it's as high as 90 percent.

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:39.933
Even though these diseases
disproportionately affect women,

00:11:39.957 --> 00:11:41.609
they are not women's diseases.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:45.321
ME affects children
and ME affects millions of men.

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:47.130
And as one patient told me,

00:11:47.154 --> 00:11:48.662
we get it coming and going --

00:11:48.686 --> 00:11:52.294
if you're a woman, you're told
you're exaggerating your symptoms,

00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:55.776
but if you're a guy, you're told
to be strong, to buck up.

00:11:56.676 --> 00:12:00.825
And men may even have
a more difficult time getting diagnosed.

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:12.284
My brain is not what it used to be.

00:12:25.914 --> 00:12:27.241
Here's the good part:

00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:30.824
despite everything, I still have hope.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:35.803
So many diseases were once
thought of as psychological

00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:38.735
until science uncovered
their biological mechanisms.

00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:42.417
Patients with epilepsy
could be forcibly institutionalized

00:12:42.441 --> 00:12:47.045
until the EEG was able to measure
abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.776
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed
as hysterical paralysis

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.112
until the CAT scan and the MRI
discovered brain lesions.

00:12:55.945 --> 00:12:57.460
And recently, we used to think

00:12:57.484 --> 00:13:00.304
that stomach ulcers
were just caused by stress,

00:13:00.328 --> 00:13:03.648
until we discovered
that H. pylori was the culprit.

00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:07.695
ME has never benefited
from the kind of science

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:10.029
that other diseases have had,

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:11.717
but that's starting to change.

00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:16.202
In Germany, scientists are starting
to find evidence of autoimmunity,

00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:18.568
and in Japan, of brain inflammation.

00:13:19.406 --> 00:13:22.460
In the US, scientists at Stanford
are finding abnormalities

00:13:22.484 --> 00:13:24.380
in energy metabolism

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:27.866
that are 16 standard deviations
away from normal.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.685
And in Norway, researchers
are running a phase-3 clinical trial

00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:36.376
on a cancer drug that in some patients
causes complete remission.

00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:39.459
What also gives me hope

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.333
is the resilience of patients.

00:13:43.968 --> 00:13:45.842
Online we came together,

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:47.930
and we shared our stories.

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:52.223
We devoured what research there was.

00:13:52.743 --> 00:13:54.820
We experimented on ourselves.

00:13:55.496 --> 00:13:57.869
We became our own scientists
and our own doctors

00:13:57.893 --> 00:13:59.484
because we had to be.

00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:04.117
And slowly I added five percent here,
five percent there,

00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:06.374
until eventually, on a good day,

00:14:06.398 --> 00:14:08.304
I was able to leave my home.

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.402
I still had to make ridiculous choices:

00:14:12.568 --> 00:14:16.409
Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,
or will I wash my hair today?

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:19.352
But it gave me hope
that I could be treated.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.035
I had a sick body; that was all.

00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:26.820
And with the right kind of help,
maybe one day I could get better.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.943
I came together with patients
around the world,

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:33.220
and we started to fight.

00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:37.034
We have filled the void
with something wonderful,

00:14:37.698 --> 00:14:39.190
but it is not enough.

00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:44.699
I still don't know if I will ever
be able to run again,

00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:46.620
or walk at any distance,

00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:50.553
or do any of those kinetic things
that I now only get to do in my dreams.

00:14:51.143 --> 00:14:54.233
But I am so grateful
for how far I have come.

00:14:55.955 --> 00:14:57.440
Progress is slow,

00:14:57.464 --> 00:14:58.756
and it is up

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.566
and it is down,

00:15:01.222 --> 00:15:04.135
but I am getting a little better each day.

00:15:06.013 --> 00:15:09.932
I remember what it was like
when I was stuck in that bedroom,

00:15:10.548 --> 00:15:13.496
when it had been months
since I had seen the sun.

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:17.314
I thought that I would die there.

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.528
But here I am today,

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:22.537
with you,

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:25.574
and that is a miracle.

00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:32.225
I don't know what would have happened
had I not been one of the lucky ones,

00:15:32.377 --> 00:15:34.554
had I gotten sick before the internet,

00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:36.969
had I not found my community.

00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:40.505
I probably would have already
taken my own life,

00:15:41.028 --> 00:15:42.935
as so many others have done.

00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:47.318
How many lives could
we have saved, decades ago,

00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:49.860
if we had asked the right questions?

00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:52.775
How many lives could we save today

00:15:53.592 --> 00:15:55.754
if we decide to make a real start?

00:15:57.205 --> 00:16:00.248
Even once the true cause
of my disease is discovered,

00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:04.356
if we don't change
our institutions and our culture,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.756
we will do this again to another disease.

00:16:07.658 --> 00:16:09.652
Living with this illness has taught me

00:16:09.676 --> 00:16:12.604
that science and medicine
are profoundly human endeavors.

00:16:13.153 --> 00:16:15.744
Doctors, scientists and policy makers

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:18.655
are not immune to the same biases

00:16:19.568 --> 00:16:21.147
that affect all of us.

00:16:23.377 --> 00:16:26.429
We need to think in more nuanced ways
about women's health.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.221
Our immune systems are just as much
a battleground for equality

00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:32.827
as the rest of our bodies.

00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:35.597
We need to listen to patients' stories,

00:16:36.542 --> 00:16:39.107
and we need to be willing
to say, "I don't know."

00:16:40.024 --> 00:16:42.376
"I don't know" is a beautiful thing.

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.827
"I don't know" is where discovery starts.

00:16:47.365 --> 00:16:48.787
And if we can do that,

00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:53.142
if we can approach the great vastness
of all that we do not know,

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:55.118
and then, rather than fear uncertainty,

00:16:55.142 --> 00:16:57.653
maybe we can greet it
with a sense of wonder.

00:16:58.342 --> 00:16:59.693
Thank you.

00:17:04.096 --> 00:17:05.336
Thank you.
