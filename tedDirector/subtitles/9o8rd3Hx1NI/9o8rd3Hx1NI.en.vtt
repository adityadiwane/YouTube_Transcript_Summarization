00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Unless we do something to prevent it,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
A cheery thought.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
On this map, every country that’s colored blue

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
This is the world we live in.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And this is the world your children will live in.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
It’s already flattening out.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
This is why it’s happening.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160
and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’s

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
or Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.160
By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
for which we have no cure or prevention --

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
that should be folded up properly

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
misfolds into a kind of demented origami.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
that function like molecular Scotch tape,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
to hold the protein into its proper shape.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
That would keep it from forming the tangles

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
which affect very different parts of the brain

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
also show tangles of misfolded protein,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
which suggests that the approach might be a general one,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
not just Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
because people with neurologic diseases

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
have a very low incidence of most cancers.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
but which we’re fascinated by.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
is being funded by private philanthropies.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
here’s what you can do for yourself.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.160
caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
You should also keep your blood pressure down,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
because chronic high blood pressure

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
"use it or lose it" applies,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
so you want to stay mentally stimulated.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
But hey, you’re listening to me.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
So you’ve got that covered.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Thank you.
