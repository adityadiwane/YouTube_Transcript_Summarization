00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Think about your day for a second.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
encountered new colleagues and had great discussions,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and felt in awe when you found something new.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
something so close to home

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that you probably don't think about it very often at all.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And that's that all the sensations, feelings,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
decisions and actions

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
are mediated by the computer in your head

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
called the brain.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
amorphous --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
but the last hundred years of neuroscience

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
have allowed us to zoom in on the brain,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and to see the intricacy of what lies within.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And they've told us that this brain

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
is an incredibly complicated circuit

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Now unlike a human-designed computer,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
where there's a fairly small number of different parts --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
we know how they work, because we humans designed them --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
maybe tens of thousands.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And they project and connect to different brain regions,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and they also change different ways in different disease states.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Let's make it concrete.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
There's a class of cells,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
It's called the basket cell.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that we are learning about.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
New ones are being discovered everyday.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
As just a second example:

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
these pyramidal cells, large cells,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
they can span a significant fraction of the brain.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
They're excitatory.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And these are some of the cells

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Every one of these cells

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
is an incredible electrical device.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and compute their own electrical outputs,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
which then, if they pass a certain threshold,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
will go to thousands of downstream partners.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
happens thousands of times a minute

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
in every one of your 100 billion cells,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
as long as you live

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and think and feel.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Ideally, we could go through the circuit

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and turn these different kinds of cell on and off

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and see whether we could figure out

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
which ones contribute to certain functions

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
what they can initiate and sustain.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
If we could turn them off,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
through an attempt to find ways

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
on and off,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
both to understand the science

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and also to confront some of the issues

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that face us all as humans.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Now before I tell you about the technology,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
if we live long enough,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Already, a billion people

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
have had some kind of brain disorder

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that incapacitates them,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and the numbers don't do it justice though.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
depression, addiction --

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
They take our identity and change our emotions

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and change who we are as people.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Now in the 20th century,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
there was some hope that was generated

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and while many drugs have been developed

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
practically none of them can be considered to be cured.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
This elaborate circuit

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
made out of thousands of different kinds of cell

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is being bathed in a substance.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
can present some kind of serious side effect too.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Now some people have gotten some solace

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And for Parkinson's disease,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Cochlear implants,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
these have indeed been able

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to bring some kind of remedy

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to people with certain kinds of disorder.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
But electricity also will go in all directions --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the path of least resistance,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So again, we're sent back to the idea

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
of ultra-precise control.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and the first thing I thought about was,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
if these neurons are electrical devices,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
all we need to do is to find some way

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
of driving those electrical changes at a distance.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
but not its neighbors,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
figure out what they do and how they contribute

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
to the networks in which they're embedded.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
in order to fix the circuit computations

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
that have gone awry.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Now how are we going to do that?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
which are able to convert light into electricity.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
You can think of them as little proteins

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
that are like solar cells.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and that's the ability to get light into the brain.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put --

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
taking advantage of all the effort

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
optical fibers connected to lasers

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
that you can use to activate, in animal models for example,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in pre-clinical studies,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
these neurons and to see what they do.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So how do we do this?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Around 2004,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
this vision came to fruition.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and it needs to navigate towards light

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
in order to photosynthesize optimally.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And it senses light with a little eye-spot,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
which works not unlike how our eye works.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
In its membrane, or its boundary,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
it contains little proteins

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
that indeed can convert light into electricity.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
just like a solar cell charging up a battery.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
So what we need to do is to take these molecules

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and somehow install them in neurons.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And because it's a protein,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So all we've got to do is take that DNA,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and put it into neurons.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and lots of viruses were coming along.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
So this turned out to be very simple to do.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and install them all over the cell,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
like putting solar panels on a roof,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and the next thing you know,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
you have a neuron which can be activated with light.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
So this is very powerful.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
One of the tricks you have to do

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and not all the other neighbors.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
so they hit just some cells and not others.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And there's other genetic tricks you can play

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
in order to get light-activated cells.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
you can take a complex network,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
use one of these viruses to deliver the gene

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
just to one kind of cell in this dense network.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And then when you shine light on the entire network,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
just that cell type will be activated.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and the one that is inhibitory.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
If we can deliver that gene to these cells --

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and then flash blue light over the entire brain network,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
just these cells are going to be driven.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
so they don't seem to be averse against that.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
what their power is in computing in the brain,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
but you can also use this to try to figure out --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
if indeed they're atrophied.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
about how we're using this,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
One of the questions we've confronted

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Because if you could find those,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
So if we could figure out what cells they are,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
we could maybe find new targets

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
for which drugs could be designed or screened against,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
or maybe places where electrodes could be put in

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
for people who have very severe disability.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
in collaboration with the Fiorella group,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
where one side of this little box,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So if these cells can mediate reward,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
the animal should go there more and more.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And so that's what happens.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
These are the dopamine neurons,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
is enough, indeed, to drive learning.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Now we can generalize the idea.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Instead of one point in the brain,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
we can devise devices that span the brain,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns --

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
arrays of optical fibers,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And then we can try to do things in vivo

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
that have only been done to-date in a dish --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
for the signals that can cause certain things to happen.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Or that could be good clinical targets

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
for treating brain disorders.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And one story I want to tell you about

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder --

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And one of the things that we did

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
was to adopt a very classical model of fear.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning --

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
where a tone ends with a brief shock.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And over time -- in this case, a mouse,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments --

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
the animal learns to fear the tone.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
The animal will react by freezing,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
sort of like a deer in the headlights.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that allow us to overcome this fear?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
So what we do is we play that tone again

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
after it's been associated with fear.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
in order to try and figure out which targets

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And so this brief video

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
shows you one of these targets that we're working on now.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
This tone used to mean bad news.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And now this next clip

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
is just eight minutes later.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Okay, there it goes. Right now.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
to overcome the expression

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
of this fear memory.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
you can figure out what necessary role they play

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
in the circuits in which they're embedded.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life --

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that respond to green and yellow light.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
where the brain is overactive.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
until the seizure dies away,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state --

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
So this animation just tries to explain this concept

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and we beam light in,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
we're hoping to be able to turn it off.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And so we don't have data to show you on this front,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
but we're very excited about this.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Now I want to close on one story,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
which we think is another possibility --

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
can be used in the brain itself

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
which allow them to hear.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
because viruses like the adeno-associated virus,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
which probably most of us around this room have,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and it doesn't have any symptoms,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
which have been used in hundreds of patients

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
to deliver genes into the brain or the body.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
associated with the virus.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
There's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
which come from algae and bacteria and fungi,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and all over the tree of life.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet --

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
but we're working on a variety of studies

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
to try and examine this,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
to these molecules

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
or to the illumination of the brain with light.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I wanted to close with one story,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
which we think could potentially

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
be a clinical application.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Now there are many forms of blindness

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
where the photoreceptors,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Now let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
are transformed by various computations

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
relay the information to the brain,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
where we see that as perception.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
or macular degeneration,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Now how could you repair this?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
because there's nothing for the drug to bind to.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
and install them on some of these other spare cells

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
and convert them into little cameras.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
So this is some work that we're doing.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
It's being led by one of our collaborators,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Alan Horsager at USC,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
which is funded by the NIH.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And the goal, of course, of this maze

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
is to get out of the water and go to a little platform

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that's under the lit top port.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
but he does a brute-force search.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
So he's not using vision to do it.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
These different mice are different mutations

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
so we come up with a generalized approach.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So how are we going to solve this?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
We're going to take these blue light photosensors

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and install them on a layer of cells

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and convert them into a camera --

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
just like installing solar cells all over those neurons

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
to make them light sensitive.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Light is converted to electricity on them.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and go to this little platform

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and make cognitive use of its eyes again.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
And to point out the power of this:

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
these animals are able to get to that platform

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
So this pre-clinical study, I think,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
bodes hope for the kinds of things

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
we're hoping to do in the future.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
We're developing these tools,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
so people can study and try to treat different disorders.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
practically none of which are cured,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
and in the 21st century make them history.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Thank you.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:53.260
(Applause)

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
(Laughter)

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
But the implications

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
of being able to control seizures or epilepsy

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
with light instead of drugs,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
and being able to target those specifically

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
is a first step.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
The second thing that I think I heard you say

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
is you can now control the brain in two colors,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
like an on/off switch.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Ed Boyden: That's right.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
EB: Right, yeah.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that work with the brain

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
so we can augment functions in people with disabilities.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
JE: And in theory, that means that,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
as a mouse feels, smells,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
hears, touches,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
EB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
what neural codes can drive certain behaviors

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
and certain thoughts and certain feelings,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and use that to understand more about the brain.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
and maybe upload them?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
EB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
We're now working on some work

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
So we can record information and then drive information back in --

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
sort of computing what the brain needs

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
in order to augment its information processing.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.)

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
(Applause)
