00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.682
Pat Mitchell: That day,

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:18.555
January 8, 2011, began like all others.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.704
You were both doing the work that you love.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.885
You were meeting with constituents,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.050
which is something that you loved doing

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.217
as a congresswoman,

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:29.622
and Mark, you were happily preparing

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.901
for your next space shuttle.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:37.080
And suddenly, everything 
that you had planned

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.031
or expected in your lives

00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.880
was irrevocably changed forever.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.879
Mark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.653
it's amazing how 
everything can change

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:47.860
for any of us in an instant.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.508
People don't realize that.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:50.698
I certainly didn't.

00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:51.356
Gabby Giffords: Yes.

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:52.606
MK: And on that Saturday morning,

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:55.570
I got this horrible phone call

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.628
from Gabby's chief of staff.

00:00:57.628 --> 00:00:59.648
She didn't have much other information.

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:01.977
She just said, "Gabby was shot."

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:03.194
A few minutes later, I called her back

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:05.575
and I actually thought for a second,

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.314
well, maybe I just imagined 
getting this phone call.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.016
I called her back, and 
that's when she told me

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.319
that Gabby had been shot in the head.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.144
And from that point on,

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:17.756
I knew that our lives were 
going to be a lot different.

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:19.733
PM: And when you arrived at the hospital,

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.457
what was the prognosis that they gave you

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:25.705
about Gabby's condition 
and what recovery, if any,

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:27.196
you could expect?

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:29.136
MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:30.338
and a traumatic brain injury,

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:33.449
they typically can't tell you much.

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:36.198
Every injury is different. It's not predictable

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.012
like often a stroke might be predictable,

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:40.746
which is another TBI kind of injury.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:43.738
So they didn't know how long
Gabby would be in a coma,

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:46.533
didn't know when that would change

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.696
and what the prognosis would be.

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:53.502
PM: Gabby, has your recovery

00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:58.004
been an effort to create 
a new Gabby Giffords

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.287
or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:05.853
GG: The new one -- better, stronger, tougher.

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:10.210
(Applause)

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.570
MK: That to say,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.976
when you look at the picture behind us,

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:17.620
to come back from that kind of injury

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.848
and come back strong 
and stronger than ever

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.684
is a really tough thing to do.

00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:23.178
I don't know anybody

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:25.800
that's as tough as my 
wonderful wife right here.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.052
(Applause)

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:31.980
PM: And what were the first signs

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.445
that recovery was not 
only going to be possible

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:38.096
but you were going to have some semblance

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:40.701
of the life that you and Gabby had planned?

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.979
MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.439
Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious,

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.965
but she did something when she
was in the ICU hospital bed

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:53.750
that she used to do when we might

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.685
be out to dinner at a restaurant,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.568
in that she pulled my ring off

00:02:57.568 --> 00:03:00.667
and she flipped it from one finger to the next,

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:02.812
and at that point I knew

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:04.396
that she was still in there.

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:06.062
PM: And there were certain words, too.

00:03:06.062 --> 00:03:09.113
Didn't she surprise you with 
words in the beginning?

00:03:09.113 --> 00:03:15.050
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning.
GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.430
MK: Yeah, that was it.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.670
For the first month, that was the extent

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.146
of Gabby's vocabulary.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:23.782
For some reason, she has aphasia,

00:03:23.782 --> 00:03:25.778
which is difficulty with communication.

00:03:25.778 --> 00:03:28.220
She latched on to the word "chicken,"

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.496
which isn't the best but 
certainly is not the worst.

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:32.981
(Laughter)

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:34.344
And we were actually worried

00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:38.585
it could have been a lot worse than that.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.945
PM: Gabby, what's been 
the toughest challenge

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:43.737
for you during this recovery?

00:03:43.737 --> 00:03:48.041
GG: Talking. Really hard. Really.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.139
MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby
knows what she wants to say,

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.013
she just can't get it out.

00:03:53.013 --> 00:03:54.425
She understands everything,

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:56.775
but the communication is just very difficult

00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:59.017
because when you look at the picture,

00:03:59.017 --> 00:04:03.653
the part of your brain where
those communication centers are

00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.433
are on the left side of your head,

00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:07.220
which is where the bullet passed through.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.433
PM: So you have to do 
a very dangerous thing:

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.079
speak for your wife.

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.684
MK: I do.

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:17.020
It might be some of the most
dangerous things I've ever done.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.920
PM: Gabby, are you optimistic

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.183
about your continuing recovery --

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:24.407
walking, talking,

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:26.911
being able to move your arm and leg?

00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:31.265
GG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:34.113
but I'm optimistic.

00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:37.317
PM: That seems to be the number one 
characteristic of Gabby Giffords,

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:38.596
wouldn't you say? (Applause)

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:40.026
MK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:42.804
She works incredibly hard every day.

00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:45.808
GG: On the treadmill, 
walked on my treadmill,

00:04:45.808 --> 00:04:49.285
Spanish lessons, French horn.

00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:51.930
MK: It's only my wife who could be --

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.678
and if you knew her before she was injured,

00:04:53.678 --> 00:04:55.590
you would kind of understand this --

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.300
somebody who could be injured

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.220
and have such a hard time communicating

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.130
and meets with a speech therapist,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.165
and then about a month ago, she says,

00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:07.867
"I want to learn Spanish again."

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:09.901
PM: Well, let's take a little closer look

00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.799
at the wife, and this was even before

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:14.525
you met Gabby Giffords.

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:16.565
And she's on a motor scooter there,

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:20.085
but it's my understanding that's a very tame image

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:22.581
of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.

00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:25.333
MK: Yeah, Gabby, she 
used to race motorcycles.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.253
So that's a scooter, but she had --

00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:30.739
well, she still has a BMW motorcycle.

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:33.415
PM: Does she ride it?
MK: Well, that's a challenge

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.063
with not being able to move her right arm,

00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:40.249
but I think with something
I know about, Velcro,

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.505
we might be able to get her back on the bike,

00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:47.119
Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.417
PM: I have a feeling we might 
see that picture next,

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:51.050
Gabby.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.495
But you meet, you're already decided

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:56.485
that you're going to dedicate 
your life to service.

00:05:56.485 --> 00:05:58.492
You're going into the military

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:00.773
and eventually to become an astronaut.

00:06:00.773 --> 00:06:03.293
So you meet.

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:06.070
What attracts you to Gabby?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.674
MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:12.280
it was the last time we were in Vancouver,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.726
about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:18.675
at the airport, on a trip 
that we were both taking

00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:20.530
to China,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.574
that I would actually, from my background,

00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:24.802
I would call it a boondoggle.

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:27.624
Gabby would â€”
GG: Fact-finding mission.

00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:31.194
MK: She would call it an
important fact-finding mission.

00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:33.580
She was a state senator at the time,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.614
and we met here, at the airport,

00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:38.132
before a trip to China.

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:40.738
PM: Would you describe it 
as a whirlwind romance?

00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:42.786
GG: No, no, no.

00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:45.486
(Laughter)

00:06:45.486 --> 00:06:47.252
A good friend.

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:49.830
MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.711
GG: Yes. (Laughter)

00:06:54.711 --> 00:07:00.567
MK: And then she invited me
on, about a year or so later,

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:03.267
she invited me on a date.

00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:04.701
Where'd we go, Gabby?

00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.899
GG: Death row.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.245
MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:13.549
at the Florence state prison in Arizona,

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:18.959
which was just outside 
Gabby's state senate district.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.856
They were working on some legislation

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:23.691
that had to do with crime and punishment

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.625
and capital punishment 
in the state of Arizona.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:28.449
So she couldn't get anybody 
else to go with her,

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.248
and I'm like, "Of course I 
want to go to death row."

00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:34.637
So that was our first date.

00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:37.367
We've been together ever since.
GG: Yes.

00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:39.457
PM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason

00:07:39.457 --> 00:07:42.009
that Gabby decided to marry you.

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:44.781
You were willing to go to death row, after all.

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.865
MK: I guess.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:49.545
PM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:55.781
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.

00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:59.271
MK: I thought we always

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.503
had a very special relationship.

00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:03.395
We've gone through some tough times

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:07.421
and it's only made it stronger.
GG: Stronger.

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.967
PM: After you got married, however,

00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:12.890
you continued very independent lives.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.211
Actually, you didn't even live together.

00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:17.045
MK: We had one of those commuter marriages.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:20.100
In our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.223
Tucson.

00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:22.903
Sometimes we'd go clockwise,

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.457
sometimes counterclockwise,

00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:26.072
to all those different places,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:29.949
and we didn't really live together

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:32.249
until that Saturday morning.

00:08:32.249 --> 00:08:34.547
Within an hour of Gabby being shot,

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.129
I was on an airplane to Tucson,

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:38.010
and that was the moment

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.753
where that had changed things.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:43.245
PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:45.517
after being a state senator

00:08:45.517 --> 00:08:48.541
and served in Congress for six years.

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:50.067
What did you like best

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.439
about being in Congress?

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:56.231
GG: Fast pace. Fast pace.

00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:58.639
PM: Well it was the way you did it.
GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:01.483
PM: I'm not sure people would
describe it entirely that way.

00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:03.196
(Laughter)

00:09:03.196 --> 00:09:05.296
MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often

00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:07.683
at a colossally slow pace,

00:09:07.683 --> 00:09:10.111
but my wife, and I have to admit,

00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.780
a lot of other members of Congress that I know,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.188
work incredibly hard.

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:15.463
I mean, Gabby would run 
around like a crazy person,

00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:17.317
never take a day off,

00:09:17.317 --> 00:09:19.443
maybe a half a day off a month,

00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:21.923
and whenever she was awake she was working,

00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:24.308
and she really, really thrived on that,

00:09:24.308 --> 00:09:26.689
and still does today.
GG: Yes. Yes.

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.067
PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:30.349
I have to say.

00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:33.927
So after the tragic incident, Mark,

00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:35.656
you decided to resign

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:37.356
your position as an astronaut,

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:38.910
even though you were supposed to take

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.651
the next space mission.

00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:42.332
Everybody, including Gabby,

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.912
talked you into going back,

00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:45.785
and you did end up taking.

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.953
MK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.057
I called my boss, the chief astronaut,

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.009
Dr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.674
"Peggy, I know I'm launching in space

00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:56.967
in three months from now.

00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:59.418
Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:01.233
You've got to find a replacement for me."

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.953
So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,

00:10:02.953 --> 00:10:05.875
but I gave up my job and they found a replacement.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:08.865
Months later, maybe about two months later,

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:11.075
I started about getting my job back,

00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:12.740
which is something,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.153
when you become this primary caregiver person,

00:10:15.153 --> 00:10:17.545
which some people in the audience here

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:20.093
have certainly been in that position,

00:10:20.093 --> 00:10:21.870
it's a challenging role but at some point

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.591
you've got to figure out when
you're going to get your life back,

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.364
and at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby

00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:30.045
if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:32.607
But I knew she wasâ€”
GG: Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:10:32.607 --> 00:10:34.647
MK: She was the biggest 
supporter of my career,

00:10:34.647 --> 00:10:36.843
and I knew it was the right thing to do.

00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:38.848
PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,

00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:42.126
what that was like, going off onto a mission,

00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:45.623
one presumes safely, 
but it's never a guarantee,

00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:48.660
and knowing that Gabby is â€”

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.128
MK: Well not only was 
she still in the hospital,

00:10:52.128 --> 00:10:54.488
on the third day of that flight,

00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:55.750
literally while I was

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.323
rendezvousing with the space station,

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.874
and you've got two vehicles
moving at 17,500 miles an hour,

00:11:00.874 --> 00:11:03.489
I'm actually flying it, looking out the window,

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:05.168
a bunch of computers,

00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:07.992
Gabby was in brain surgery,

00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:10.676
literally at that time having the final surgery

00:11:10.676 --> 00:11:13.618
to replace the piece of skull

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:15.367
that they took out on the day she was injured

00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:19.060
with a prosthetic, yeah, which
is the whole side of her head.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.040
Now if any of you guys would ever come

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.276
to our house in Tucson for the first time,

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:26.012
Gabby would usually go up to the freezer

00:11:26.012 --> 00:11:28.080
and pull out the piece of Tupperware

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.140
that has the real skull. (Laughter)

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.244
GG: The real skull.
MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.

00:11:34.244 --> 00:11:37.936
PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?

00:11:37.936 --> 00:11:42.034
MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:44.062
PM: But there was a lot 
of conversation about

00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:47.140
something you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.578
You had to make another 
step of courage too,

00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:54.380
because here was 
Congress deadlocked again,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.302
and you got out of the rehabilitation center,

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:02.763
got yourself to Washington

00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:05.670
so that you could walk 
on the floor of the House --

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.322
I can barely talk about this
without getting emotional â€”

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:11.281
and cast a vote which could have been

00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:13.116
the deciding vote.

00:12:13.116 --> 00:12:16.365
GG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.

00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:18.924
MK: Yeah, we had that vote,

00:12:18.924 --> 00:12:20.874
I guess about five months after Gabby was injured,

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.372
and she made this bold decision to go back.

00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:25.525
A very controversial vote,

00:12:25.525 --> 00:12:27.034
but she wanted to be there

00:12:27.034 --> 00:12:29.631
to have her voice heard one more time.

00:12:29.631 --> 00:12:31.406
PM: And after that, resigned

00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:35.360
and began what has been a very slow

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.848
and challenging recovery.

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:40.986
What's life like, day to day?

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:43.973
MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.

00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:44.936
GG: Nelson.

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:47.479
MK: New member of our family.
GG: Yes, yes.

00:12:47.479 --> 00:12:50.271
MK: And we got him from aâ€”

00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:52.134
GG: Prison. Murder.
MK: We have a lot of connections

00:12:52.134 --> 00:12:54.786
with prisons, apparently. (Laughter)

00:12:54.786 --> 00:12:56.175
Nelson came from a prison,

00:12:56.175 --> 00:13:00.719
raised by a murderer in Massachusetts.

00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:05.049
But she did a great job with this dog.

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:07.436
He's a fabulous service dog.

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:10.379
PM: So Gabby, what have you learned

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:14.513
from your experiences the past few years?

00:13:14.513 --> 00:13:20.521
MK: Yeah, what have you learned?
GG: Deeper. Deeper.

00:13:20.521 --> 00:13:22.383
PM: Your relationship is deeper.

00:13:22.383 --> 00:13:25.582
It has to be. You're together all the time now.

00:13:25.582 --> 00:13:28.040
MK: I imagine being grateful, too, right?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.422
GG: Grateful.

00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:31.489
PM: This is a picture of 
family and friends gathering,

00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:35.822
but I love these pictures because they show

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:39.357
the Gabby and Mark relationship now.

00:13:39.357 --> 00:13:41.885
And you describe it, Gabby, over and over,

00:13:41.885 --> 00:13:47.710
as deeper on so many levels. Yes?

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.262
MK: I think when something tragic happens

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:51.916
in a family, it can pull people together.

00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:54.080
Here's us watching the space shuttle

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.130
fly over Tucson,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.276
the Space Shuttle Endeavour,

00:13:57.276 --> 00:13:59.847
the one that I was the 
commander on its last flight,

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.353
on its final flight on top of an airplane

00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:06.473
on a 747 on its way to L.A.,

00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:11.083
NASA was kind enough 
to have it fly over Tucson.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:14.559
PM: And of course, the two of you

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:16.141
go through these challenges

00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:18.533
of a slow and difficult recovery,

00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:21.214
and yet, Gabby, how do you maintain

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:24.941
your optimism and positive outlook?

00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:28.086
GG: I want to make the world a better place.

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:35.508
(Applause)

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:37.366
PM: And you're doing that

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.560
even though your recovery has to remain

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.462
front and center for both of you.

00:14:41.462 --> 00:14:43.740
You are people who have done service

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.442
to your country and you 
are continuing to do that

00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:50.461
with a new initiative, a new purpose.

00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:53.868
And Gabby, what's on the agenda now?

00:14:53.868 --> 00:14:57.223
GG: Americans for Responsible Solutions.

00:14:57.223 --> 00:15:01.362
MK: That's our political action committee,

00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:04.759
where we are trying to 
get members of Congress

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:08.110
to take a more serious look at
gun violence in this country,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.160
and to try to

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.210
pass some reasonable legislation.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:19.213
GG: Yes. Yes. (Applause)

00:15:19.213 --> 00:15:21.690
MK: You know, this affected 
us very personally,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.412
but it wasn't what happened
to Gabby that got us involved.

00:15:24.412 --> 00:15:28.240
It was really the 20 murdered first graders

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.178
and kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,

00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:33.732
and the response that we saw afterwards

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:37.157
where -- well, look what's happened so far.

00:15:37.157 --> 00:15:39.182
So far the national response has been

00:15:39.182 --> 00:15:40.510
pretty much to do nothing.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.322
We're trying to change that.

00:15:42.322 --> 00:15:43.814
PM: There have been 11 mass shootings

00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:44.972
since Newtown,

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:48.186
a school a week in the first 
two months of last year.

00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:49.910
What are you doing that's different

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.140
than other efforts to balance

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.962
rights for gun ownership and responsibilities?

00:15:54.962 --> 00:15:57.304
MK: We're gun owners, 
we support gun rights.

00:15:57.304 --> 00:15:59.546
At the same time, we've 
got to do everything we can

00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:02.083
to keep guns out of the hands of criminals

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:03.976
and the dangerously mentally ill.

00:16:03.976 --> 00:16:06.494
It's not too difficult to do that.

00:16:06.494 --> 00:16:08.170
This issue, like many others,

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.159
has become very polarizing and political,

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:14.460
and we're trying to bring some balance

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.924
to the debate in Washington.

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:17.962
PM: Thank you both for that effort.

00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:21.196
And not surprisingly for 
this woman of courage

00:16:21.196 --> 00:16:22.992
and of a sense of adventure,

00:16:22.992 --> 00:16:25.351
you just keep challenging yourself,

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:27.154
and the sky seems to be the limit.

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:28.898
I have to share this video

00:16:28.898 --> 00:16:31.446
of your most recent adventure.

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:34.380
Take a look at Gabby.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.579
MK: This is a couple months ago.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:44.375
(Video) MK: You okay? You did great.
GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:50.563
Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you.

00:16:50.563 --> 00:16:54.941
Mountains. Gorgeous mountains.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.071
(Applause)

00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:03.913
MK: Let me just say

00:17:03.913 --> 00:17:05.948
one of the guys that Gabby jumped with

00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:08.018
that day was a Navy SEAL

00:17:08.018 --> 00:17:10.286
who she met in Afghanistan

00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:11.835
who was injured in combat,

00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:13.327
had a really rough time.

00:17:13.327 --> 00:17:14.861
Gabby visited him

00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.539
when he was at Bethesda

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:18.940
and went through a really tough period.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.447
He started doing better.

00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:22.697
Months later, Gabby was shot in the head,

00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:23.971
and then he supported her

00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:25.973
while she was in the hospital in Houston.

00:17:25.973 --> 00:17:28.178
So they have a very, very nice connection.

00:17:28.178 --> 00:17:29.420
GG: Yes.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.576
PM: What a wonderful moment.

00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:32.533
Because this is the TED stage,

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:35.956
Gabby, I know you worked very hard

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:39.270
to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.840
with this audience.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.690
GG: Thank you.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.950
Hello, everyone.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.250
Thank you for inviting us here today.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.380
It's been a long, hard haul,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.521
but I'm getting better.

00:17:58.521 --> 00:18:00.430
I'm working hard,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.901
lots of therapy -- speech therapy,

00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:07.166
physical therapy, and yoga too.

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:09.680
But my spirit is strong as ever.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.880
I'm still fighting to make 
the world a better place,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.832
and you can too.

00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:20.319
Get involved with your community.

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:23.941
Be a leader. Set an example.

00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:26.998
Be passionate. Be courageous.

00:18:26.998 --> 00:18:30.620
Be your best. Thank you very much.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.435
