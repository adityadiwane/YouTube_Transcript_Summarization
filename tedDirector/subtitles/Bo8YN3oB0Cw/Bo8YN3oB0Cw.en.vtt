00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.539
Have you ever heard the one
about how breastfeeding is free?

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:18.236
(Laughter)

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.476
Yeah, it's pretty funny,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.580
because it's only free if we don't value
women's time and energy.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.516
Any mother can tell you
how much time and energy it takes

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.476
to liquify her body --

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.036
to literally dissolve herself --

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.636
(Laughter)

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.540
as she feeds this precious
little cannibal.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.156
(Laughter)

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.500
Milk is why mammals suck.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.116
At Arizona State University,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.076
in the Comparative Lactation Lab,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.876
I decode mothers' milk composition

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.876
to understand its complexity

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
and how it influences infant development.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900
The most important thing that I've learned

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.740
is that we do not do enough
to support mothers and babies.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.716
And when we fail mothers and babies,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.100
we fail everyone
who loves mothers and babies:

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.076
the fathers, the partners,
the grandparents, the aunties,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
the friends and kin
that make our human social networks.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.036
It's time that we abandon
simple solutions and simple slogans,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.780
and grapple with the nuance.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.596
I was very fortunate

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.276
to run smack-dab
into that nuance very early,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.340
during my first interview
with a journalist

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.676
when she asked me,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.980
"How long should a mother
breastfeed her baby?"

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.740
And it was that word "should"
that brought me up short,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.780
because I will never tell a woman
what she should do with her body.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.396
Babies survive and thrive

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.076
because their mother's milk
is food, medicine and signal.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.316
For young infants,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.276
mother's milk is a complete diet

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.876
that provides all the building
blocks for their bodies,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.276
that shapes their brain

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.460
and fuels all of their activity.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.596
Mother's milk also feeds the microbes

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.060
that are colonizing
the infant's intestinal tract.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.356
Mothers aren't just eating for two,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.540
they're eating for two to the trillions.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.820
Milk provides immunofactors
that help fight pathogens

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.820
and mother's milk provides hormones
that signal to the infant's body.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.116
But in recent decades,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.276
we have come to take milk for granted.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.276
We stopped seeing
something in plain sight.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.436
We began to think of milk as standardized,
homogenized, pasteurized,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.420
packaged, powdered,
flavored and formulated.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.676
We abandoned the milk of human kindness

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.740
and turned our priorities elsewhere.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.116
At the National Institutes of Health

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.756
in Washington DC

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.620
is the National Library of Medicine,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.076
which contains 25 million articles --

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.340
the brain trust of life science
and biomedical research.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.276
We can use keywords
to search that database,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.556
and when we do that,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.660
we discover nearly a million
articles about pregnancy,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.820
but far fewer about
breast milk and lactation.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.660
When we zoom in on the number of articles
just investigating breast milk,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.796
we see that we know much more
about coffee, wine and tomatoes.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.020
(Laughter)

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.036
We know over twice as much
about erectile dysfunction.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.580
(Laughter)

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.636
I'm not saying we shouldn't
know about those things --

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.356
I'm a scientist, I think
we should know about everything.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.716
But that we know so much less --

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.516
(Laughter)

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.836
about breast milk --

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.636
the first fluid a young mammal
is adapted to consume --

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.020
should make us angry.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.276
Globally, nine out of 10 women will
have at least one child in her lifetime.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.756
That means that nearly 130 million
babies are born each year.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.900
These mothers and babies
deserve our best science.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.556
Recent research has shown
that milk doesn't just grow the body,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.820
it fuels behavior
and shapes neurodevelopment.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.636
In 2015, researchers discovered

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.636
that the mixture of breast milk
and baby saliva --

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.716
specifically, baby saliva --

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.556
causes a chemical reaction
that produces hydrogen peroxide

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.340
that can kill staph and salmonella.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.876
And from humans and other mammal species,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.316
we're starting to understand
that the biological recipe of milk

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.460
can be different when produced
for sons or daughters.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.996
When we reach for donor milk
in the neonatal intensive care unit,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.996
or formula on the store shelf,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.340
it's nearly one-size-fits-all.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.036
We aren't thinking about how sons
and daughters may grow at different rates,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.276
or different ways,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.020
and that milk may be a part of that.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.956
Mothers have gotten the message

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.396
and the vast majority of mothers
intend to breastfeed,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.260
but many do not reach
their breastfeeding goals.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.436
That is not their failure;

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.900
it's ours.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.156
Increasingly common medical conditions
like obesity, endocrine disorders,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.796
C-section and preterm births

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.420
all can disrupt the underlying
biology of lactation.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.820
And many women do not have
knowledgeable clinical support.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.716
Twenty-five years ago,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.596
the World Health Organization
and UNICEF established criteria

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.196
for hospitals to be
considered baby friendly --

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.036
that provide the optimal level
of support for mother-infant bonding

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.380
and infant feeding.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.676
Today, only one in five babies
in the United States

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.860
is born in a baby-friendly hospital.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.276
This is a problem,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.156
because mothers can grapple
with many problems

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.236
in the minutes, hours, days
and weeks of lactation.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.756
They can have struggles
with establishing latch,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.996
with pain,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.236
with milk letdown

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.740
and perceptions of milk supply.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.316
These mothers deserve
knowledgeable clinical staff

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.540
that understand these processes.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.820
Mothers will call me as they're
grappling with these struggles,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.100
crying with wobbly voices.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.420
"It's not working.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.716
This is what I'm supposed
to naturally be able to do.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.980
Why is it not working?"

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.900
And just because something
is evolutionarily ancient

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.620
doesn't mean that it's easy
or that we're instantly good at it.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.036
You know what else
is evolutionarily ancient?

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.340
(Laughter)

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.316
Sex.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.276
And nobody expects us
to start out being good at it.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.460
(Laughter)

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.836
Clinicians best deliver
quality equitable care

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.876
when they have continuing education

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.020
about how to best support
lactation and breastfeeding.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.876
And in order to have
that continuing education,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.036
we need to anchor it
to cutting-edge research

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.556
in both the life sciences
and the social sciences,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.276
because we need to recognize

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.580
that too often

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.876
historical traumas and implicit biases

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.420
sit in the space between
a new mother and her clinician.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.100
The body is political.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.276
If our breastfeeding support
is not intersectional,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.180
it's not good enough.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.916
And for moms who have to return for work,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.956
because countries like the United States
do not provide paid parental leave,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.140
they can have to go back in as short
as just a few days after giving birth.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.556
How do we optimize
mother and infant health

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.916
just by messaging
about breast milk to moms

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.716
without providing
the institutional support

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.396
that facilitates
that mother-infant bonding

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.860
to support breastfeeding?

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.500
The answer is: we can't.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.276
I'm talking to you, legislators,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.236
and the voters who elect them.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.956
I'm talking to you, job creators
and collective bargaining units,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.140
and workers, and shareholders.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.116
We all have a stake
in the public health of our community,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.100
and we all have a role
to play in achieving it.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.100
Breast milk is a part
of improving human health.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.836
In the NICU, when infants are born
early or sick or injured,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.580
milk or bioactive constituents in milk
can be critically important.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.596
Environments or ecologies,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.836
or communities where there's
high risk of infectious disease,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.316
breast milk can be incredibly protective.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.955
Where there are emergencies
like storms and earthquakes,

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.475
when the electricity goes out,

00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:49.475
when safe water is not available,

00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:52.300
breast milk can keep babies
fed and hydrated.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.876
And in the context of humanitarian crises,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.100
like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.580
the smallest drops can buffer babies
from the biggest global challenges.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.036
But understanding breast milk
is not just about messaging to mothers

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.580
and policy makers.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.996
It's also about understanding
what is important in breast milk

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.796
so that we can deliver better formulas

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.620
to moms who cannot or do not
breastfeed for whatever reason.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.076
We can all do a better job

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.396
of supporting the diversity
of moms raising their babies

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.140
in a diversity of ways.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.356
As women around the world struggle

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.036
to achieve political,
social and economic equality,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.596
we must reimagine motherhood

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.836
as not the central,
core aspect of womanhood,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.340
but one of the many potential facets
of what makes women awesome.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.100
It's time.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.263
(Applause)
