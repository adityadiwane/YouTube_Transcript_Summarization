00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Millions of people were in severe need of help.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.260
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
it is hard to believe

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
not having detailed maps.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
But help was coming.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
At Google, 40 volunteers

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
used a new software

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And it took them four days.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to map what we know locally.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
People have used this software

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to map everything from roads to rivers,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
from schools to local businesses,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and video stores to the corner store.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Maps matter.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
for most developing countries

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
For example, a trillion dollars

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
In the last year alone,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
thousands of users in 170 countries

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And this was made possible by

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
the power of passionate users everywhere.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Let's look at some of the maps

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
being created by users right now.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in these 170 countries.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.260
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
This is the result of computational geometry,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
This is a victory of thousands of users,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
in hundreds of cities,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
one user, one edit at a time.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of our unmapped planet.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Welcome to the new world.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Applause)
