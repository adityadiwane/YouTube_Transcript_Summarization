00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.348
I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.291
I basically had to roll down the window.

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:26.503
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:28.857
and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:31.614
He said that it would overheat the engine.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.262
And you might remember, some of you,

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.162
how the cars were back then, and it was

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:37.528
a common problem of overheating.

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:41.548
But it was also the signal that capped the use,

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:45.970
or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.009
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.170
We blast the air conditioning the entire way,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.746
and we never experience overheating.

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:56.733
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:02.351
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.817
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.496
The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:12.014
very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:14.414
and the small windows were also very good because

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:17.005
it limited the amount of temperature transfer

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.472
between the interior and exterior.

00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:23.344
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.740
rolled steel and mass production, we were able

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.190
to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.916
and with that came the irreversible reliance on

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:40.497
mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:43.601
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.242
our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:50.116
were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:52.875
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.075
and for some of you may understand the heat island effect

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:59.585
in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.535
than the adjacent rural areas,

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.789
but we also have problems that, when we lose power,

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.550
we can't open a window here, and so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.364
the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:15.012
until that air conditioning system can start up again.

00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:19.067
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:24.052
move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:26.419
just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.197
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.

00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:34.448
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us

00:02:34.448 --> 00:02:37.299
out of this hole that we've dug?

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.208
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:43.864
I was a biology major before I went into architecture,

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:48.253
the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates

00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:51.689
the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.304
That's the first line of defense for the body.

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:57.513
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things

00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:00.931
that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.435
and so what I propose is that our building skins

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:07.084
should be more similar to human skin,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:11.196
and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive

00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:14.452
and differentiated, depending on where it is.

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:16.385
And this gets me back to my research.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:21.695
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:24.606
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:26.325
and a smart thermo-bimetal.

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:29.237
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires

00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:31.967
no controls and it requires no energy,

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:34.630
and that's a very big deal for architecture.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.444
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.

00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:41.318
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.

00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:44.793
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,

00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:48.090
when heated, one side will expand faster than the other

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.627
and result in a curling action.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:55.333
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:59.526
how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:02.631
air to ventilate through the system,

00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:05.860
and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.341
of having these strips together can try to make

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:12.415
bigger movement happen when also heated,

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:16.479
and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.965
in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:22.863
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:26.903
out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy

00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:30.720
that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.730
when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.099
and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.252
so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:44.130
move through and out when necessary.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.261
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,

00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:51.007
as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.483
each of the tiles moves individually.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.995
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:59.008
this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:03.737
and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.249
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.248
each one to be very, very specific to its location,

00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:15.194
to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.

00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:18.000
So this kind of proof of concept project

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.964
has a lot of implications

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:23.664
to actual future application in architecture,

00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:26.169
and in this case, here you see a house,

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.602
that's for a developer in China,

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:31.346
and it's actually a four-story glass box.

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:35.183
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:39.065
but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:41.530
it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.558
open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.

00:05:45.558 --> 00:05:50.120
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.416
so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:55.008
in the space during different times of day.

00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:58.271
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,

00:05:58.271 --> 00:06:01.688
we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:03.855
because we can sheath the building with these things,

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:09.422
as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.

00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:12.811
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,

00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:15.300
and so here you see a pretty typical

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.031
double-glazed window panel, and in that panel,

00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.958
between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.135
I'm trying to work on making

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.204
a thermo-bimetal pattern system

00:06:27.204 --> 00:06:29.876
so that when the sun hits that outside layer

00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:34.520
and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.296
will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.599
is it'll start to block out the sun

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.473
in certain areas of the building,

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:43.414
and totally, if necessary.

00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:45.922
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:48.599
in a high-rise building where the panel systems go

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.366
from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.556
could be differentiated at different times of day

00:06:55.556 --> 00:07:01.015
depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:03.834
And these are some later studies that I'm working on

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:06.098
right now that are on the boards, where you can see,

00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:09.439
in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.717
smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,

00:07:11.717 --> 00:07:16.963
we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.

00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:19.445
This last project is also of components.

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:23.302
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my

00:07:23.302 --> 00:07:26.878
spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.

00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:29.485
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:32.887
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:36.377
and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,

00:07:36.377 --> 00:07:39.759
and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.941
consider that in architecture too, how we can bring

00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:44.607
air through holes in the sides of a building.

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:47.580
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.093
where those holes are actually coming through,

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:53.813
and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,

00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:56.512
and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little

00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:59.720
hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.898
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:06.500
is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.540
and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.086
and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.902
components that I'm working on, and again,

00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:16.214
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine

00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:18.941
that air could potentially be coming through the walls

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.822
instead of opening windows.

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:24.510
So I want to leave you with one last impression about

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.890
the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.070
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.063
day after day, when you're on vacation

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:39.102
and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.457
or when there's a power outage, and you have

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:44.478
no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals

00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:48.476
will still be working tirelessly, efficiently

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:51.782
and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:54.574
(Applause)
