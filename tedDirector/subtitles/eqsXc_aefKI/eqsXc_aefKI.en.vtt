00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It's great being here at TED.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
You know, I think there might be some presentations

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that will go over my head,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
but the most amazing concepts

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
are the ones that go right under my feet.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
The little things in life,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
sometimes that we forget about,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
like pollination, that we take for granted.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And you can't tell the story about pollinators --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
without telling the story about the invention of flowers

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and how they co-evolved

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
over 50 million years.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I've been filming time-lapse flowers

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
for over 35 years.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
To watch them move

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Beauty and seduction, I believe,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
is nature's tool for survival,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
because we will protect what we fall in love with.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Their relationship

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
is a love story that feeds the Earth.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
It reminds us that we are a part of nature,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and we're not separate from it.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
it motivated me to take action.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
We depend on pollinators

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And many scientists believe

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
it's the most serious issue facing mankind.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
It's like the canary in the coalmine.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
If they disappear, so do we.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
It reminds us that we are a part of nature

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and we need to take care of it.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
What motivated me to film their behavior

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
was something that I asked my scientific advisers:

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
"What motivates the pollinators?"

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Well, their answer was,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
"It's all about risk and reward."

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I go, "Why?"

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
"Well, in order to reproduce."

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
"Well, why?"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Everything in the universe wears out."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And that blew my mind.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Because I realized

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that nature had invented reproduction

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
as a mechanism for life to move forward,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
as a life force that passes right through us

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and makes us a link in the evolution of life.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Rarely seen by the naked eye,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
this intersection

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
between the animal world and the plant world

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
is truly a magic moment.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
It's the mystical moment

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
where life regenerates itself,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
over and over again.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So here is some nectar from my film.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I hope you'll drink, tweet

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and plant some seeds

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to pollinate a friendly garden.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And always take time to smell the flowers,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and let it fill you with beauty,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and rediscover that sense of wonder.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Here are some images from the film.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.260
(Music)

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:30.260
(Applause)

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Thank you.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Thank you very much.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.260
(Applause)

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Thank you.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
(Applause)
