00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
playing with blocks.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
pick them up and move them around,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
you were actually learning how to think and solve problems

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
to how we understand a lot of the world around us.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
So, as a computer scientist

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
moving around a flat desktop,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
arranging it the way we wanted?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
by building Siftables.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
the size of a cookie.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
They're able to be moved around by hand,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
and they have a screen and a wireless radio.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Most importantly, they're physical,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
of tools for manipulating digital information.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And as these tools become more physical,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
more aware of their motion, aware of each other,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
and aware of the nuance of how we move them,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
This Siftable is configured to show video,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
If they get surrounded, they notice that too,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
they might get a little flustered.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.160
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
was that we could use everyday gestures on data,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and I can use them to pour color into that central one,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
where they get mixed.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
There are also some neat possibilities for education,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
like language, math and logic games

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and view the results immediately.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
So here I'm --

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
(Applause)

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Basically, in every round

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
(Applause)

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Thank you.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
(Applause)

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
They really loved it.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
is that you don't have to give people many instructions.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
All you have to say is, "Make words,"

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
and they know exactly what to do.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
So here's another few people trying it out.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
So to him, they were just blocks.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
And this is Felix, actually.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And he can bring new characters into the scene,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Here, he's bringing the sun out.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
Video: The sun is rising.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
Video: The orange tractor.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Good job! Yeah!

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
he can make the characters interact --

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Video: Woof!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
DM: inventing his own narrative.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Video: Hello!

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
DM: It's an open-ended story,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
and he gets to decide how it unfolds.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Video: Fly away, cat.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
is a music sequencing and live performance tool

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
that we've built recently,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
in which Siftables act as sounds

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
like lead, bass and drums.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Each of these has four different variations,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
you get to choose which one you want to use.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
that apply to the entire sequence.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
So let's have a look.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
Video: (Music)

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
DM: We'll start by putting a lead

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.160
into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
extend it, add a little more lead.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
Now I put a bass line in.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Video: (Music)

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Video: (Music)

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Video: (Music)

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
DM: I can speed up the whole sequence

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
by tilting the tempo one way or the other.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Video: (Music)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
Video: (Music)

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
making it longer or shorter as I go.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.160
(Applause)

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Thank you.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
So, as you can see,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
So the thought I want to leave you with

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
for interacting with digital media

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
that are going to bring information into our world

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
on our terms.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Thank you very much.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
I look forward to talking with all of you.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
(Applause)
