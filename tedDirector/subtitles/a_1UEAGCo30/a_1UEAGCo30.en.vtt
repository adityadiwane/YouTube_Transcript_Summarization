Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and they like to say funny words

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
like "barrel roll."

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
It's a video game move from "Star Fox."

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
"4chan!"

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Christopher Poole: When I was 15,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I found this website called Futaba Channel.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
That format of forum, at that time,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
was not well-known outside of Japan.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and I stuck it up for my friends to use.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Now, six and a half years later,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
over seven million people are using it,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And we've gone from one board

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
to 48 boards.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
This is what it looks like.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So, what's unique about the site

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
is that it's anonymous,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and it has no memory.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
These things that we're used to with forums

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
don't exist on 4chan.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And that's led to this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
What the site's known for,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
because it has this environment,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
is it's fostered the creation of a lot of

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
just silly pictures of cats with text.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
because there are tens of thousands of these,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and there is a whole blogging empire now

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
dedicated to pictures like these.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
these past two years ...

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Rickroll was this bait and switch,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
really simple, classic bait and switch.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And it got big enough to the point where

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
millions of people on television.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
(Laughter)

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
the ones I've just shown you,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
but every day, every month,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
people are producing thousands of these.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
So does a site like this have rules?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
which are more-or-less ignored by the community.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And so they've come up with their own set of rules,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
the "Rules of the Internet."

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Two is you do not talk about /b/.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And this one's kind of interesting:

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
(Laughter)

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And I will spare you that slide.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I assure you, it is very true.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
/b/ is the first board we started with,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and it is, in many ways,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
the beating heart of the website.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And /b/ is known for,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
more than anything,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and that was the Time 100 poll.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So somebody at Time, at the magazine,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
thought it would be fun to nominate me

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
for this thing they did last year.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And so they placed me on it,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and the Internet got wind of it. My community

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
decided they wanted me to win it.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
(Laughter)

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So they broke that poll.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And I ended up on top.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
I ended up at this really fancy party.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But that's not what's interesting about this.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
they were actually --

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
all of the top 21 places

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
(Laughter)

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
The amount of time and effort that went into that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
is absolutely incredible.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And "marble cake" is significant because

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Anonymous is this group of people

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that protested, very famously,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Scientology.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
The story is,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And so these people, over 7,000 people,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
less than one month later,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
this is L.A. --

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
protested the Church of Scientology,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and they have continued to do so,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
now, two full years after the fact.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
They are still protesting.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Laughter)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
that's come out of the site.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And last, I'm going to show you the example,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the story of Dusty the cat.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
This young man

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
posted a video

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
of him abusing his cat on YouTube.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And, you know, this didn't sit well with people,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and so there was this outpouring of support

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
for people to do something about this.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
the Internet detectives came out.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
They matched, they found his MySpace.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Within 24 hours,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
they had his name,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and within 48 hours, he was arrested.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.260
(Applause)

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And so, what I think is really intriguing

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
about a community like 4chan

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
is just that it's this open place.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And sites like it are kind of

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
going the way of the dinosaur right now.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
They're endangered because we're moving

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
towards social networking.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We're moving towards persistent identity.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We're moving towards,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
you know, a lack of privacy, really.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Thank you.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.260
(Applause)

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Got a couple questions for you.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
CP: You're lucky that this is not

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
being streamed to them live right now.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
CA: Well, you never know. Some of them --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
we've got people in 75 countries out there watching.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Don't tell.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
But seriously,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
this issue on anonymity is --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
I mean, you made the case there.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
all the rules gone.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And I'm just curious whether you

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
sometimes lie awake in the night

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
worrying that you've opened Pandora's box.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
CP: Yes and no.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I mean, for as much good

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
that kind of comes out of this environment,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
there is plenty of bad.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
There are plenty of downsides.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
But I think that the greater good

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
is being served here by just allowing people --

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
there are very few places, now, where you can go

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and not have identity, to be completely anonymous

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and say whatever you'd like.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
But I think it's important to have these places.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
this outlet, where I can come after work

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and be myself."

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
CA: But words, saying things,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And if you cut the link between what is said

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and any attribution back to you,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
I mean, surely there are huge risks with that.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
CP: There are, certainly.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
But --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
what you might say at TED, right?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
CP: Yeah, I posted a thread

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
on Sunday.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And within 24 hours,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
it had over 12,000 responses.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And the thing is,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
I didn't make it into that presentation

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
(Laughter)

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
99 percent of it is just,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
would have been, you know, bleeped out.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
But there were some good things that came out of that too.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
(Laughter)

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Love and peace were mentioned.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
CA: Love and peace were mentioned,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
kind of with quote marks around them, right?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
CA: And that content is all off the board now.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
CP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
It went up to about 16,000 posts,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and now it has been taken off.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
CA: Okay, well.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
You've got this surprising

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
semi-underground influence,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
What's the commercial picture here?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
much of one, I guess.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
The site has adult content on it.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
just in terms of language alone.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
any hope of making lots of money.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
CA: But you still live at home, right?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
CP: I actually moved out recently.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
CA: That's very cool.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
(Applause)

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
CP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
CA: But what conversations did you or do you

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
have with your mother about 4chan?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
CP: At first, very kind of pained,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
awkward conversations.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
But my parents -- I think part of why

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
they kind of are able to appreciate it

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
is because they don't understand it.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
(Laughter)

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
CA: And they were probably pleased to see you

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
on top of the Time poll.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
(Laughter)

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
CA: And so, in 10 years' time,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
what do you picture yourself doing?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
CP: That's a good question.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
As I said, I just went back to school,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
and I am considering

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
majoring in urban studies

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and then going on to urban planning,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and trying to adapt that

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
to a physical community.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.
