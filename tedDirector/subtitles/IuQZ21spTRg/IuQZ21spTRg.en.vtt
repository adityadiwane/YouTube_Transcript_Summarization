00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:18.847
So little Billy goes to school,

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:21.604
and he sits down and the teacher says,

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.609
"What does your father do?"

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.266
And little Billy says, "My father plays the piano

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.372
in an opium den."

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.361
So the teacher rings up the parents, and says,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.615
"Very shocking story from little Billy today.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.364
Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:42.524
in an opium den."

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:46.383
And the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied.

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:50.014
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:54.423
that his father is a politician?" (Laughter)

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:57.671
Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,

00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.326
or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:03.902
when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:06.996
they look at me as though I'm somewhere between

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:11.750
a snake, a monkey and an iguana,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.692
and through all of this, I feel, strongly,

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.674
that something is going wrong.

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:21.870
Four hundred years of maturing democracy,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.738
colleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:28.316
reasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:32.963
energetic, informed population, and yet

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:37.867
a deep, deep sense of disappointment.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:41.839
My colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:46.593
family doctors, businesspeople, professors,

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:50.816
distinguished economists, historians, writers,

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:55.818
army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.

00:01:55.818 --> 00:01:59.479
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.587
those strange stone gargoyles just down the road,

00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:07.613
feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:13.286
feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:17.414
And this isn't just a problem in Britain.

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:20.147
It's a problem across the developing world,

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:22.781
and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,

00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.089
for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament,

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.069
you meet them, and they're often people who are

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.513
Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:37.574
and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.218
and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:45.303
that you can see in any middle-income country in the world:

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:48.066
a dismal, depressing landscape

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:51.256
of burnt and half-abandoned buildings.

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:54.384
And this has been true for 30 years, and the handover

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:58.650
in 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.125
the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:05.355
who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:08.358
over 800 people were killed in the streets

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:11.885
in drug-related violence.

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:15.367
Ten years ago, however, the promise of democracy

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:19.350
seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.510
in his State of the Union address in 2003

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.539
and said that democracy was the force that would beat

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.565
most of the ills of the world. He said,

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:33.338
because democratic governments respect their own people

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:39.072
and respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.

00:03:39.072 --> 00:03:42.706
Distinguished academics at the same time argued that

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:46.384
democracies had this incredible range of side benefits.

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:49.684
They would bring prosperity, security,

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.505
overcome sectarian violence,

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:56.970
ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.324
Since then, what's happened?

00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:02.518
Well, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:06.506
and Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:09.396
which haven't had any of those side benefits.

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:12.389
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.056
or two elections. We've gone through three elections,

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:18.183
presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:21.794
Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.255
and good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan

00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:29.400
is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.585
a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.589
a media which is beginning to get onto its feet

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:39.414
but a government that's deeply unpopular,

00:04:39.414 --> 00:04:43.182
perceived as being deeply corrupt, and security

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:46.995
that is shocking, security that's terrible.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:51.653
In Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:54.645
again you can see democracy and elections are compatible

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:58.494
with corrupt governments, with states that are unstable

00:04:58.494 --> 00:05:01.351
and dangerous.

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.635
And when I have conversations with people, I remember

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:06.516
having a conversation, for example, in Iraq,

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:09.205
with a community that asked me

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:12.715
whether the riot we were seeing in front of us,

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:16.538
this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,

00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:21.230
was a sign of the new democracy.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.371
The same, I felt, was true in almost every single one

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.319
of the middle and developing countries that I went to,

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.370
and to some extent the same is true of us.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.946
Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just

00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:37.604
give up on the idea of democracy?

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:41.346
Well, obviously not. It would be absurd

00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:44.133
if we were to engage again in the kind of operations

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:47.209
we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.729
if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.404
in which we were imposing

00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:55.843
anything other than a democratic system.

00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:58.395
Anything else would run contrary to our values,

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:00.646
it would run contrary to the wishes of the people

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:04.269
on the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:07.576
I remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.117
a period of feeling that we should delay democracy.

00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:12.809
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:16.387
from Bosnia was that elections held too early

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:20.621
enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,

00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:23.439
so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.556
let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:30.728
voter education. Let's invest in democratization.

00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:34.746
The result was that I found stuck outside my office

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:36.918
a huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph

00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:40.398
taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq

00:06:40.398 --> 00:06:44.523
of people standing outside screaming for the elections,

00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:47.289
and when I went out and said, "What is wrong

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:50.249
with the interim provincial council?

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.917
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen?

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:56.662
There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.813
there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes,

00:06:59.813 --> 00:07:02.367
there's a Christian, there's a Sabian,

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:06.611
there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,

00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:09.251
what's wrong with the people that we chose?"

00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:12.349
The answer came, "The problem isn't the people

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:18.150
that you chose. The problem is that you chose them."

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.582
I have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most

00:07:21.582 --> 00:07:24.709
remote community, anybody who does not want

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:27.493
a say in who governs them.

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:29.554
Most remote community, I have never met a villager

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:33.136
who does not want a vote.

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:36.416
So we need to acknowledge

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:39.998
that despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that

00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:45.421
84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken,

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:48.393
despite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll

00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:52.651
in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,

00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:54.975
and the answer came back that

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.036
seven percent wanted the United States,

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:00.759
five percent wanted France,

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.414
three percent wanted Britain,

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:07.769
and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.535
not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:15.238
minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:18.400
for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.752
we need to get away from instrumental arguments.

00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:25.320
We need to get away from saying democracy matters

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.427
because of the other things it brings.

00:08:28.427 --> 00:08:30.552
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way,

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:34.149
human rights matters because of the other things it brings,

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:37.841
or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.

00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:40.145
Why should we get away from those arguments?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.549
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:47.242
for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract

00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:52.440
good information, or we say, you need women's rights

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.120
because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.777
you leave yourself open to the position where

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:00.870
the government of North Korea can turn around and say,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.733
"Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:06.234
good information with our torture at the moment,"

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.194
or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well,

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:09.923
our economic growth's okay, thank you very much,

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:11.383
considerably better than yours,

00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:16.189
so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:19.870
The point about democracy is not instrumental.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.659
It's not about the things that it brings.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:25.224
The point about democracy is not that it delivers

00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:31.468
legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.

00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:36.113
It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.

00:09:36.113 --> 00:09:39.030
The point about democracy is intrinsic.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.361
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality

00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:48.769
and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:52.639
the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:56.240
should have an equal vote, an equal say,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.235
in the formation of their government.

00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:04.301
But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:06.914
if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved

00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:11.715
in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:16.103
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.

00:10:16.103 --> 00:10:20.120
It is a state of mind. It is an activity.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.911
And part of that activity is honesty.

00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:27.449
After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:29.752
called "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed

00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:33.552
about politicians on these kinds of radio programs

00:10:33.552 --> 00:10:37.017
is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer

00:10:37.017 --> 00:10:38.652
to a question. It doesn't matter what it is.

00:10:38.652 --> 00:10:42.004
If you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins

00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:46.626
in the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:49.258
the developments in Chongqing contribute

00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:51.592
to sustainable development in carbon capture,

00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:54.354
and we will have an answer for you.

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:57.539
We need to stop that, to stop pretending to be

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:59.424
omniscient beings.

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:02.984
Politicians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:06.730
certain things that voters want, certain things that voters

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.593
have been promised, may be things

00:11:10.593 --> 00:11:13.738
that we cannot deliver

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:17.520
or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.411
And the second thing we should do is understand

00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:23.403
the genius of our societies.

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:27.432
Our societies have never been so educated, have never

00:11:27.432 --> 00:11:30.368
been so energized, have never been so healthy,

00:11:30.368 --> 00:11:33.316
have never known so much, cared so much,

00:11:33.316 --> 00:11:39.212
or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.

00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:41.910
One of the reasons why we're moving away

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.411
from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,

00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:49.887
banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling

00:11:49.887 --> 00:11:51.662
of kings enthroned,

00:11:51.662 --> 00:11:54.814
the entire drama played out here on this space,

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.673
where the King of England had his head lopped off,

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:02.004
why we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:05.729
towards the town hall, is we're moving more and more

00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:09.677
towards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.

00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:12.467
That can mean different things in different countries.

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:15.780
In Britain, it could mean looking to the French,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.523
learning from the French,

00:12:17.523 --> 00:12:21.152
getting directly elected mayors in place

00:12:21.152 --> 00:12:23.640
in a French commune system.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.474
In Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:29.028
on the big presidential and parliamentary elections,

00:12:29.028 --> 00:12:31.345
we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution

00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:36.025
from the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going

00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:41.572
at a district level and elect people's provincial governors.

00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:44.295
But for any of these things to work,

00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:47.118
the honesty in language, the local democracy,

00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:49.886
it's not just a question of what politicians do.

00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:51.954
It's a question of what the citizens do.

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:56.861
For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,

00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:59.440
and the media, which mediates between the politicians

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.071
and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.

00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:07.693
If local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active

00:13:07.693 --> 00:13:11.929
and informed engagement of every citizen.

00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:16.330
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.654
is to become again vigorous and vibrant,

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:23.800
it is necessary not just for the public

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.714
to learn to trust their politicians,

00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:31.586
but for the politicians to learn to trust the public.

00:13:31.586 --> 00:13:35.586
Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
