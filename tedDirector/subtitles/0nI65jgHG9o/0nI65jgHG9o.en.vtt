00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:18.472
Blah blah blah blah blah.

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.399
Blah blah blah blah,

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.994
blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:25.741
Blah blah blah, blah.

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:29.170
So what the hell was that?

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.689
Well, you don't know
because you couldn't understand it.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.620
It wasn't clear.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.768
But hopefully, it was said
with enough conviction

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:43.467
that it was at least
alluringly mysterious.

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.973
Clarity or mystery?

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:52.199
I'm balancing these two things
in my daily work as a graphic designer,

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.031
as well as my daily life as a New Yorker

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:58.561
every day,

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:03.028
and there are two elements
that absolutely fascinate me.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.390
Here's an example.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170
Now, how many people know what this is?

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.727
Okay. Now how many people
know what this is?

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:24.410
Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes
by the genius Charles M. Schulz,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.454
we now have seven deft strokes
that in and of themselves

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.984
create an entire emotional life,

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.863
one that has enthralled
hundreds of millions of fans

00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:35.906
for over 50 years.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.420
This is actually a cover of a book

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.711
that I designed about the work
of Schulz and his art,

00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.497
which will be coming out this fall,

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:46.378
and that is the entire cover.

00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:51.324
There is no other typographic information
or visual information on the front,

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:54.737
and the name of the book
is "Only What's Necessary."

00:01:55.317 --> 00:02:00.790
So this is sort of symbolic about
the decisions I have to make every day

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.706
about the design that I'm perceiving,

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.985
and the design I'm creating.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:08.842
So clarity.

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:11.421
Clarity gets to the point.

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.758
It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:19.370
We ask ourselves this.
["When should you be clear?"]

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.818
Now, something like this,
whether we can read it or not,

00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:28.418
needs to be really, really clear.

00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:30.455
Is it?

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:39.284
This is a rather recent example
of urban clarity that I just love,

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:44.392
mainly because I'm always late
and I am always in a hurry.

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:51.288
So when these meters started showing up
a couple of years ago on street corners,

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.748
I was thrilled, because now I finally knew

00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:57.673
how many seconds I had
to get across the street

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:00.553
before I got run over by a car.

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:05.475
Six? I can do that. (Laughter)

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:09.283
So let's look at the yin
to the clarity yang,

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:12.812
and that is mystery.

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:18.176
Mystery is a lot more complicated
by its very definition.

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:21.659
Mystery demands to be decoded,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.643
and when it's done right,
we really, really want to.

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:26.303
["When should you be mysterious?"]

00:03:26.303 --> 00:03:32.107
In World War II, the Germans
really, really wanted to decode this,

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:34.731
and they couldn't.

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:37.912
Here's an example of a design
that I've done recently

00:03:37.912 --> 00:03:40.234
for a novel by Haruki Murakami,

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:43.438
who I've done design work for
for over 20 years now,

00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:49.150
and this is a novel about a young man
who has four dear friends

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.819
who all of a sudden,
after their freshman year of college,

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.116
completely cut him off
with no explanation,

00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:57.973
and he is devastated.

00:03:57.973 --> 00:04:03.376
And the friends' names each have
a connotation in Japanese to a color.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:08.050
So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue,
there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.160
Tsukuru Tazaki, his name
does not correspond to a color,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.610
so his nickname is Colorless, and
as he's looking back on their friendship,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.776
he recalls that they were like
five fingers on a hand.

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:24.257
So I created this sort of abstract
representation of this,

00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:28.437
but there's a lot more going on
underneath the surface of the story,

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:33.110
and there's more going on underneath
the surface of the jacket.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.515
The four fingers are now four train lines

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:39.582
in the Tokyo subway system,

00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:41.973
which has significance within the story.

00:04:42.813 --> 00:04:45.610
And then you have
the colorless subway line

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.173
intersecting with each
of the other colors,

00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:50.820
which basically he does
later on in the story.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.802
He catches up with each of these people

00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:56.332
to find out why they treated him
the way they did.

00:04:56.332 --> 00:05:00.558
And so this is the three-dimensional
finished product

00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:02.879
sitting on my desk in my office,

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.546
and what I was hoping for here
is that you'll simply be allured

00:05:07.546 --> 00:05:11.401
by the mystery of what this looks like,

00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:14.196
and will want to read it

00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:19.345
to decode and find out and make more clear
why it looks the way it does.

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:21.858
["The Visual Vernacular."]

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:26.177
This is a way to use a more
familiar kind of mystery.

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:27.938
What does this mean?

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:30.772
This is what it means.
["Make it look like something else."]

00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:35.302
The visual vernacular is the way
we are used to seeing a certain thing

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:39.691
applied to something else so that
we see it in a different way.

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:43.840
This is an approach I wanted to take
to a book of essays by David Sedaris

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.211
that had this title at the time.
["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]

00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:51.402
Now, the challenge here was that
this title actually means nothing.

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:54.792
It's not connected to any
of the essays in the book.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:59.503
It came to the author's boyfriend
in a dream.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:05.659
Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) --
so usually, I am creating a design

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.722
that is in some way based on the text,
but this is all the text there is.

00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:14.111
So you've got this mysterious title
that really doesn't mean anything,

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.610
so I was trying to think:

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.848
Where might I see a bit of mysterious text
that seems to mean something but doesn't?

00:06:22.848 --> 00:06:25.255
And sure enough, not long after,

00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:28.570
one evening after a Chinese meal,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.062
this arrived, and I thought,
"Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)

00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:40.673
I've always loved the hilariously
mysterious tropes of fortune cookies

00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:43.575
that seem to mean something extremely deep

00:06:43.575 --> 00:06:47.662
but when you think about them -- if you
think about them -- they really don't.

00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:53.907
This says, "Hardly anyone knows how much
is gained by ignoring the future."

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:56.899
Thank you. (Laughter)

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.046
But we can take this visual vernacular
and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:08.657
and we are so familiar
with how fortune cookie fortunes look

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.424
that we don't even need
the bits of the cookie anymore.

00:07:11.424 --> 00:07:14.419
We're just seeing this strange thing

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.416
and we know we love David Sedaris,

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:19.300
and so we're hoping that
we're in for a good time.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.048
["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"]
David Rakoff was a wonderful writer

00:07:23.048 --> 00:07:26.211
and he called his first book "Fraud"

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:30.171
because he was getting sent
on assignments by magazines

00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:32.841
to do things that he
was not equipped to do.

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.163
So he was this skinny little urban guy

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.762
and GQ magazine would send him
down the Colorado River

00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:42.478
whitewater rafting to see
if he would survive.

00:07:43.378 --> 00:07:46.679
And then he would write about it,
and he felt that he was a fraud

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:48.978
and that he was misrepresenting himself.

00:07:48.978 --> 00:07:53.645
And so I wanted the cover of this book
to also misrepresent itself

00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:58.916
and then somehow show
a reader reacting to it.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:02.167
This led me to graffiti.

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:04.210
I'm fascinated by graffiti.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.903
I think anybody who lives
in an urban environment

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.943
encounters graffiti all the time,
and there's all different sorts of it.

00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:14.550
This is a picture I took
on the Lower East Side

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.398
of just a transformer box on the sidewalk

00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:19.372
and it's been tagged like crazy.

00:08:19.372 --> 00:08:24.991
Now whether you look at this and think,
"Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"

00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:29.379
or you look at it and say,
"That's illegal abuse of property,"

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:31.724
the one thing I think we can all agree on

00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:34.905
is that you cannot read it.

00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:38.458
Right? There is no clear message here.

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:43.682
There is another kind of graffiti
that I find far more interesting,

00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:46.538
which I call editorial graffiti.

00:08:46.538 --> 00:08:50.744
This is a picture I took recently
in the subway,

00:08:50.744 --> 00:08:54.610
and sometimes you see
lots of prurient, stupid stuff,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.517
but I thought this was interesting,
and this is a poster that is saying

00:08:59.517 --> 00:09:01.747
rah-rah Airbnb,

00:09:01.747 --> 00:09:04.510
and someone has taken a Magic Marker

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.434
and has editorialized about
what they think about it.

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:11.266
And it got my attention.

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:14.692
So I was thinking, how do we
apply this to this book?

00:09:14.692 --> 00:09:20.405
So I get the book by this person,
and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:25.079
this guy is not who he says 
he is; he's a fraud.

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.540
And I get out a red Magic Marker,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.151
and out of frustration just
scribble this across the front.

00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:37.259
Design done. (Laughter)

00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:42.190
And they went for it! (Laughter)

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.107
Author liked it, publisher liked it,

00:09:44.107 --> 00:09:46.824
and that is how the book
went out into the world,

00:09:46.824 --> 00:09:51.723
and it was really fun to see
people reading this on the subway

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:53.859
and walking around with it
and what have you,

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:57.760
and they all sort of looked
like they were crazy.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.120
(Laughter)

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.633
["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"]
Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,

00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.117
a good friend, I've worked
with him for many years.

00:10:07.117 --> 00:10:09.325
He is probably best known as the author

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:12.295
of "The Black Dahlia"
and "L.A. Confidential."

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:17.150
His most recent novel was called this,
which is a very mysterious name

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.756
that I'm sure a lot of people know
what it means, but a lot of people don't.

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:27.814
And it's a story about a Japanese-American
detective in Los Angeles in 1941

00:10:27.814 --> 00:10:29.834
investigating a murder.

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.247
And then Pearl Harbor happens,

00:10:32.247 --> 00:10:35.357
and as if his life
wasn't difficult enough,

00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:40.200
now the race relations
have really ratcheted up,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.718
and then the Japanese-American
internment camps are quickly created,

00:10:44.718 --> 00:10:46.738
and there's lots of tension

00:10:46.738 --> 00:10:50.824
and horrible stuff as he's still
trying to solve this murder.

00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:56.656
And so I did at first think
very literally about this in terms of

00:10:56.656 --> 00:11:00.538
all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor
and we'll add it to Los Angeles

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:07.736
and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn
on the horizon of the city.

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:10.561
And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor

00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:13.625
just grafted onto Los Angeles.

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:16.899
My editor in chief said,
"You know, it's interesting

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:22.286
but I think you can do better
and I think you can make it simpler."

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:26.506
And so I went back
to the drawing board, as I often do.

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:31.197
But also, being alive to my surroundings,

00:11:31.197 --> 00:11:34.830
I work in a high-rise in Midtown,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.500
and every night,
before I leave the office,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.745
I have to push this button to get out,

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:44.483
and the big heavy glass doors open
and I can get onto the elevator.

00:11:44.483 --> 00:11:47.979
And one night, all of a sudden,

00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:53.750
I looked at this and I saw it in a way
that I hadn't really noticed it before.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.279
Big red circle, danger.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:59.158
And I thought this was so obvious

00:11:59.158 --> 00:12:01.875
that it had to have been
done a zillion times,

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:06.449
and so I did a Google image search,
and I couldn't find another book cover

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:08.608
that looked quite like this,

00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:11.232
and so this is really
what solved the problem,

00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:13.763
and graphically it's more interesting

00:12:13.763 --> 00:12:17.989
and creates a bigger tension
between the idea

00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:23.096
of a certain kind of sunrise
coming up over L.A. and America.

00:12:23.506 --> 00:12:26.492
["'Gulp' A tour of the human
digestive system by Mary Roach."]

00:12:26.492 --> 00:12:28.530
Mary Roach is an amazing writer

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.152
who takes potentially mundane
scientific subjects

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.540
and makes them not mundane at all;
she makes them really fun.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.167
So in this particular case,

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:40.279
it's about the human digestive system.

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:45.201
So I'm trying to figure out what
is the cover of this book going to be.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.845
This is a self-portrait. (Laughter)

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:55.905
Every morning I look at myself
in the medicine cabinet mirror

00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:58.622
to see if my tongue is black.

00:12:58.622 --> 00:13:02.170
And if it's not, I'm good to go.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.279
(Laughter)

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:10.296
I recommend you all do this.

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:14.243
But I also started thinking,
here's our introduction.

00:13:14.243 --> 00:13:17.122
Right? Into the human digestive system.

00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:20.210
But I think what we can all agree on

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.460
is that actual photographs
of human mouths, at least based on this,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.244
are off-putting. (Laughter)

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:32.145
So for the cover, then,
I had this illustration done

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.374
which is literally more palatable

00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:38.902
and reminds us that it's best
to approach the digestive system

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.200
from this end.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.847
(Laughter)

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:46.793
I don't even have to complete
the sentence. All right.

00:13:47.533 --> 00:13:49.079
["Unuseful mystery"]

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:53.156
What happens when clarity
and mystery get mixed up?

00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.489
And we see this all the time.

00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:57.997
This is what I call unuseful mystery.

00:13:57.997 --> 00:14:00.946
I go down into the subway --
I take the subway a lot --

00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:05.450
and this piece of paper
is taped to a girder.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.243
Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:14.120
and the train's about to come and I'm
trying to figure out what this means,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.914
and thanks a lot.

00:14:16.914 --> 00:14:20.914
Part of the problem here is that
they've compartmentalized the information

00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:24.420
in a way they think is helpful,
and frankly, I don't think it is at all.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.694
So this is mystery we do not need.

00:14:27.694 --> 00:14:35.780
What we need is useful clarity,
so just for fun, I redesigned this.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.259
This is using all the same elements.

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:41.182
(Applause)

00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:45.837
Thank you. I am still waiting
for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)

00:14:46.447 --> 00:14:49.506
You know, I'm actually not even
using more colors than they use.

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:52.803
They just didn't even bother
to make the 4 and the 5 green,

00:14:52.803 --> 00:14:55.961
those idiots. (Laughter)

00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:59.920
So the first thing we see
is that there is a service change,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.613
and then, in two complete sentences
with a beginning, a middle and an end,

00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:08.383
it tells us what the change is
and what's going to be happening.

00:15:08.383 --> 00:15:12.440
Call me crazy! (Laughter)

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.161
["Useful mystery"]
All right.

00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:21.841
Now, here is a piece
of mystery that I love:

00:15:21.841 --> 00:15:23.498
packaging.

00:15:23.498 --> 00:15:26.772
This redesign of the Diet Coke can

00:15:26.772 --> 00:15:32.200
by Turner Duckworth
is to me truly a piece of art.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.716
It's a work of art. It's beautiful.

00:15:35.716 --> 00:15:38.893
But part of what makes it
so heartening to me as a designer

00:15:38.893 --> 00:15:43.351
is that he's taken the visual
vernacular of Diet Coke --

00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:46.889
the typefaces, the colors,
the silver background --

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:51.974
and he's reduced them
to their most essential parts,

00:15:51.974 --> 00:15:54.714
so it's like going back
to the Charlie Brown face.

00:15:54.714 --> 00:15:58.661
It's like, how can you give them just
enough information so they know what it is

00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:02.539
but giving them the credit
for the knowledge that they already have

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:04.396
about this thing?

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:08.181
It looks great, and you would go
into a delicatessen

00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:12.631
and all of a sudden see that on the shelf,
and it's wonderful.

00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:16.330
Which makes the next thing --

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.862
["Unuseful clarity"] --
all the more disheartening,

00:16:18.862 --> 00:16:20.510
at least to me.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.350
So okay, again, going back
down into the subway,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.440
after this came out,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.460
these are pictures that I took.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.503
Times Square subway station:

00:16:30.503 --> 00:16:35.681
Coca-Cola has bought out
the entire thing for advertising. Okay?

00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:39.990
And maybe some of you
know where this is going.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.438
Ahem.

00:16:42.438 --> 00:16:45.056
"You moved to New York
with the clothes on your back,

00:16:45.056 --> 00:16:47.640
the cash in your pocket,
and your eyes on the prize.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.147
You're on Coke." (Laughter)

00:16:57.298 --> 00:17:00.251
"You moved to New York
with an MBA, one clean suit,

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.341
and an extremely firm handshake.

00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:05.138
You're on Coke." (Laughter)

00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:10.142
These are real! (Laughter)

00:17:10.142 --> 00:17:13.973
Not even the support beams were spared,

00:17:13.973 --> 00:17:17.789
except they switched into Yoda mode.
(Laughter)

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.838
"Coke you're on." (Laughter)

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:25.998
["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"]

00:17:26.018 --> 00:17:29.623
This campaign was a huge misstep.

00:17:29.623 --> 00:17:34.310
It was pulled almost instantly
due to consumer backlash

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.850
and all sorts of unflattering
parodies on the web --

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.731
(Laughter) --

00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:46.451
and also that dot next to "You're on,"
that's not a period, that's a trademark.

00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:48.421
So thanks a lot.

00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:52.433
So to me, this was just so bizarre

00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:58.447
about how they could get the packaging
so mysteriously beautiful and perfect

00:17:58.447 --> 00:18:02.905
and the message so unbearably,
clearly wrong.

00:18:02.905 --> 00:18:06.365
It was just incredible to me.

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:11.891
So I just hope that I've been able
to share with you some of my insights

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:15.699
on the uses of clarity
and mystery in my work,

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:21.005
and maybe how you might decide
to be more clear in your life,

00:18:21.005 --> 00:18:27.273
or maybe to be a bit more mysterious
and not so over-sharing.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.110
(Laughter)

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.806
And if there's just one thing
that I leave you with from this talk,

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:37.757
I hope it's this:

00:18:37.757 --> 00:18:41.022
Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.
["'Judge This,' Chip Kidd"]

00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:44.086
Blih blih blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah.

00:18:44.086 --> 00:18:45.883
Blah blah.

00:18:45.883 --> 00:18:49.883
(Applause)
