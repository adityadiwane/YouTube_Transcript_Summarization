00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.616
When I was a kid,
my parents would tell me,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.039
"You can make a mess,
but you have to clean up after yourself."

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.776
So freedom came with responsibility.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.376
But my imagination would take me
to all these wonderful places,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.496
where everything was possible.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.416
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.776
or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.896
because adults would lie to us
to protect us from the ugly truth.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.496
And growing up, I found out
that adults make a mess,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.320
and they're not very good
at cleaning up after themselves.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.496
Fast forward, I am an adult now,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.496
and I teach citizen science and invention
at the Hong Kong Harbour School.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.856
And it doesn't take too long

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.096
before my students walk on a beach
and stumble upon piles of trash.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.776
So as good citizens,
we clean up the beaches --

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.520
and no, he is not drinking alcohol,
and if he is, I did not give it to him.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.640
(Laughter)

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.176
And so it's sad to say,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.976
but today more than 80 percent 
of the oceans have plastic in them.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.280
It's a horrifying fact.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.176
And in past decades,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.656
we've been taking those big ships out
and those big nets,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.016
and we collect those plastic bits
that we look at under a microscope,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.256
and we sort them,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.042
and then we put this data onto a map.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.776
But that takes forever,
it's very expensive,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.936
and so it's quite risky
to take those big boats out.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.896
So with my students, ages six to 15,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.136
we've been dreaming
of inventing a better way.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.576
So we've transformed our tiny
Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.256
And so we started building
this small workbench,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.456
with different heights,
so even really short kids can participate.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.656
And let me tell you, kids with power tools
are awesome and safe.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.016
(Laughter)

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.936
Not really.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.176
And so, back to plastic.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.816
We collect this plastic and we grind it
to the size we find it in the ocean,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.016
which is very small
because it breaks down.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.416
And so this is how we work.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.576
I let the imaginations
of my students run wild.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.856
And my job is to try to collect
the best of each kid's idea

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.160
and try to combine it into something
that hopefully would work.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.056
And so we have agreed
that instead of collecting plastic bits,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.056
we are going to collect only the data.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.056
So we're going to get an image
of the plastic with a robot --

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.456
so robots, kids get very excited.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.623
And the next thing we do --
we do what we call "rapid prototyping."

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.336
We are so rapid at prototyping

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.536
that the lunch is still in the lunchbox
when we're hacking it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.856
(Laughter)

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.136
And we hack table lamps and webcams,
into plumbing fixtures

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.296
and we assemble that into a floating robot
that will be slowly moving through water

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.416
and through the plastic
that we have there --

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.631
and this is the image
that we get in the robot.

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.376
So we see the plastic pieces
floating slowly through the sensor,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.696
and the computer on board
will process this image,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.816
and measure the size of each particle,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.960
so we have a rough estimate
of how much plastic there is in the water.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.536
So we documented
this invention step by step

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.936
on a website for inventors
called Instructables,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.760
in the hope that somebody
would make it even better.

00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:19.696
What was really cool about this project
was that the students saw a local problem,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.387
and boom -- they are trying
to immediately address it.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.736
[I can investigate my local problem]

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.976
But my students in Hong Kong
are hyperconnected kids.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.296
And they watch the news,
they watch the Internet,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.560
and they came across this image.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.576
This was a child, probably under 10,
cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.096
in the Sundarbans, which is the world's
largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.576
So they were very shocked,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.896
because this is the water they drink,
this is the water they bathe in,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.296
this is the water they fish in --
this is the place where they live.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.216
And also you can see the water is brown,
the mud is brown and oil is brown,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.717
so when everything is mixed up,

00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.216
it's really hard to see
what's in the water.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.496
But, there's a technology
that's rather simple,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.056
that's called spectrometry,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.985
that allows you see what's in the water.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.056
So we built a rough prototype
of a spectrometer,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.016
and you can shine light
through different substances

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.456
that produce different spectrums,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.336
so that can help you
identify what's in the water.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.256
So we packed this prototype of a sensor,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.520
and we shipped it to Bangladesh.

00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:25.656
So what was cool about this project

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.815
was that beyond addressing
a local problem,

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.269
or looking at a local problem,

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:34.216
my students used their empathy
and their sense of being creative

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.496
to help, remotely, other kids.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.235
[I can investigate a remote problem]

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.879
So I was very compelled
by doing the second experiments,

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:43.416
and I wanted to take it even further --

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.040
maybe addressing an even harder problem,
and it's also closer to my heart.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.176
So I'm half Japanese and half French,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.520
and maybe you remember in 2011
there was a massive earthquake in Japan.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.936
It was so violent that it triggered
several giant waves --

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.376
they are called tsunami --

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.360
and those tsunami destroyed many cities
on the eastern coast of Japan.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.040
More than 14,000 people
died in an instant.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.336
Also, it damaged the nuclear
power plant of Fukushima,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.040
the nuclear power plant just by the water.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.896
And today, I read the reports

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.976
and an average of 300 tons

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.576
are leaking from the nuclear power plant
into the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.976
And today the whole Pacific Ocean
has traces of contamination of cesium-137.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.416
If you go outside on the West Coast,
you can measure Fukushima everywhere.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.736
But if you look at the map,
it can look like most of the radioactivity

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.856
has been washed away
from the Japanese coast,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.696
and most of it is now --
it looks like it's safe, it's blue.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.136
Well, reality is a bit
more complicated than this.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.816
So I've been going to Fukushima
every year since the accident,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.376
and I measure independently
and with other scientists,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.256
on land, in the river --

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.016
and this time we wanted to take the kids.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.816
So of course we didn't take the kids,
the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.176
(Laughter)

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.136
But every night we would report
to "Mission Control" --

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.336
different masks they're wearing.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.736
It could look like they didn't take
the work seriously, but they really did

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.960
because they're going to have to live
with radioactivity their whole life.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.696
And so what we did with them

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.336
is that we'd discuss the data
we collected that day,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.551
and talk about where
we should be going next --

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.696
strategy, itinerary, etc...

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.336
And to do this, we built
a very rough topographical map

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.216
of the region around
the nuclear power plant.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.256
And so we built the elevation map,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.896
we sprinkled pigments to represent
real-time data for radioactivity,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.256
and we sprayed water
to simulate the rainfall.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.256
And with this we could see
that the radioactive dust

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.336
was washing from the top of the mountain
into the river system,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.896
and leaking into the ocean.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.520
So it was a rough estimate.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.616
But with this in mind,
we organized this expedition,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.256
which was the closest civilians have been
to the nuclear power plant.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.616
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away
from the nuclear power plant,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.593
and with the help of the local fisherman,

00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:17.856
we are collecting sediment from the seabed

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.336
with a custom sediment sampler
we've invented and built.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.616
We pack the sediment into small bags,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.896
we then dispatch them
to hundreds of small bags

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.856
that we send to different universities,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.856
and we produce the map
of the seabed radioactivity,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.416
especially in estuaries
where the fish will reproduce,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.496
and I will hope that we will have improved

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.616
the safety of the local fishermen
and of your favorite sushi.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.936
(Laughter)

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.536
You can see a progression here --

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.096
we've gone from a local problem
to a remote problem to a global problem.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.073
And it's been super exciting
to work at these different scales,

00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:53.656
with also very simple,
open-source technologies.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.016
But at the same time,
it's been increasingly frustrating

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.736
because we have only started to measure
the damage that we have done.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.840
We haven't even started
to try to solve the problems.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.416
And so I wonder
if we should just take a leap

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.080
and try to invent better ways
to do all these things.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.096
And so the classroom
started to feel a little bit small,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.816
so we found an industrial
site in Hong Kong,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.096
and we turned it into
the largest mega-space

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.296
focused on social
and environmental impact.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.616
It's in central Hong Kong,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.856
and it's a place we can work
with wood, metal, chemistry,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.506
a bit of biology, a bit of optics,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.022
basically you can build
pretty much everything there.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:38.016
And its a place where
adults and kids can play together.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.616
It's a place where
kids' dreams can come true,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.976
with the help of adults,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.816
and where adults can be kids again.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.976
Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.135
Cesar Harada: We're asking
questions such as,

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.976
can we invent the future of mobility
with renewable energy?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.200
For example.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.616
Or, can we help the mobility
of the aging population

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.040
by transforming very standard wheelchairs
into cool, electric vehicles?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.776
So plastic, oil and radioactivity
are horrible, horrible legacies,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.320
but the very worst legacy
that we can leave our children is lies.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.976
We can no longer afford
to shield the kids from the ugly truth

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.920
because we need their imagination
to invent the solutions.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.696
So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.416
we must prepare the next generation

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.496
that cares about
the environment and people,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.720
and that can actually
do something about it.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.416
Thank you.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.600
(Applause)
