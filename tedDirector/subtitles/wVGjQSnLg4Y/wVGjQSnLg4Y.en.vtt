00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
How will we be remembered in 200 years?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.330
which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
It happened 225 years ago.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
and it was a very, very severe winter.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.330
And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.330
from hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
What they remember is, of course, the great triumph,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.330
that the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
It's the child that's remembered.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.330
And that's what we're going through at this time.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.330
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist --

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
(Laughter)

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
What I'm saying is that we should follow the model

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
that has been so successful with the electronic industry,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.330
that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.330
as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
when kids could come home and play with them,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.330
There's a huge --

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
(Laughter)

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
(Applause)

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
-- there's a huge community of people in the world

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.330
pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
people who handle biology with their hands,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.330
and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.330
plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.330
and that will be an enormous positive step

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
to acceptance of biotechnology.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.330
That will blow away a lot of the opposition.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
When people have this technology in their hands,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.330
you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own --

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
grow your dog, grow your own cat.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
(Laughter)

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
(Applause)

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.330
Just buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.330
you can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.330
I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
becomes part of the human condition,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
So, let's leave that aside.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
I want to talk about something quite different,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
which is what I know about, and that is astronomy.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.330
And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.330
And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
or whatever the time remains.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
The important fact is, that most of the real estate

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.330
for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.330
most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
If you look at the solar system, as we know it today,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.330
it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.330
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.330
the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.330
but not very large. And it's not very promising for life,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.330
It's not only cold, but very dry.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.330
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.330
There stand some interesting places a little further out:

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is --

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
where we see a very level ice surface,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.330
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.330
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.330
just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
to go down through the ice,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
find out who is swimming around in the ocean,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.330
whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters --

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.330
whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.330
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there --

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
That's something we don't yet know how to do.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.330
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Go out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.330
way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.330
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.330
these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
in the cold of the outer solar system,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
but they are biologically very interesting indeed,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
which are just the right ones for developing life.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
So if life could be established out there,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.330
it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight --

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
everything that's needed.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
So, what I'm proposing

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.330
is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.330
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And that's what I'm going to talk about.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.330
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.330
and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.330
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
just as it did on the Earth.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great --

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.330
developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:29.330
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Now, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
it could also have moved out onto the surface.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
There wouldn't have been any air there -- it's a vacuum.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.330
It is out in the cold, but it still could have come.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.330
You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.330
through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
What would they need in order to grow on the surface?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:09:00.330
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.330
from losing water through the skin.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
But better -- what is more important

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.330
is 25 times fainter than it is here,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:36.330
which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.330
either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.330
Otherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
which is certainly not favorable for developing life,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
at least of the kind we know.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
But if they just simply could grow, like leaves,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
then they could keep warm on the surface.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.330
They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.330
and have roots going down into the ocean;

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
life then could flourish much more.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
So, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
that there's life on the surface of Europa.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
None of these things is likely, but my,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:27.330
my philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
turning out to be there. And I mean,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.330
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:51.330
Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.330
They said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.330
and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.330
that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:19.330
and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
so it certainly will not be detectable.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
So there's no point in looking."

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.330
by about 20 years.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
which was after about 20 years,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:53.330
radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:58.330
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.330
just because we haven't taken the trouble to look.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.330
So, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
There is something called pit lamping.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
That's the phrase which I learned from my son George,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
who is there in the audience.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:28.330
You take -- that's a Canadian expression.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
If you happen to want to hunt animals at night,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
you take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
You strap it onto your forehead, so you can see

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.330
the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:48.330
you shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
You see the red glow in their eyes,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
which is the reflection of the flashlight.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.330
And then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.330
you shoot the animals and take them home.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And of course, that spoils the game

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.330
so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.330
because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
So, the farmers go out at night

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.330
with heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
and anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
(Laughter)

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
So I have proposed to apply the same trick

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
to looking for life in the universe.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces --

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.330
on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.330
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors --

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
in order to keep themselves warm.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.330
And then, when you shine sunlight at them,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
the sunlight will be reflected back,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.330
just as it is in the eyes of an animal.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.330
And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.330
the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
as you go further away,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.330
because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:34.330
shines out even more in contrast against the dark background.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
So as you go further away from the Sun,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.330
this becomes more and more powerful.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:46.330
So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:55.330
But I hope that we shall look, and with any --

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
we probably won't find anything,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.330
none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
it will transform our view of life altogether.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.330
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.330
It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
We're having great difficulties at the moment

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
Especially if you breathe air,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.330
(Laughter)

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.330
-- you're dead --

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
(Laughter)

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
-- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.330
But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.330
smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
and you get knocked off the surface by a collision,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
then it doesn't change anything all that much.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.330
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.330
and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.330
And then if you run into another object, you can stay there

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.330
from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:38.330
a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution --

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.330
so there'll be a huge advantage to the species

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.330
which is able to jump from one place to another

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.330
without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:56.330
for spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.330
I call these creatures sunflowers.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.330
They look like, maybe like sunflowers.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and they will be able to spread out in space,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.330
because gravity on these objects is weak.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.330
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.330
So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:26.330
and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.330
If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
(Laughter)

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:40.330
That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.330
We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.330
of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.330
take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit --

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
(Laughter) --

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330
is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.330
a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.330
That would be a fun thing to do.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.330
(Laughter)

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
In the long run, of course,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:16.330
it would also make it possible for us to move out there.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.330
What's going to happen in the end,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.330
it's not going to be just humans colonizing space,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.330
it's going to be life moving out from the Earth,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.330
moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.330
of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.330
it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.330
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.330
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
than it is today.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.330
So again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.330
Thank you.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:06.330
(Applause)
