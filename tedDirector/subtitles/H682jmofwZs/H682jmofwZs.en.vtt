00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.160
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
(Laughter)

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And you're on the outside, you're at home.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
You're like the Raspyni Brothers,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
where you've got your balls in cold water. And --

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
(Laughter) --

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.160
you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.160
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And you want to go back and do it again.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
within the subject of creation and optimism.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
And if you put creation and optimism together,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
you've got two choices that you can talk about.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
You can talk about creationism --

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.160
or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
But any kind of conversation about architecture --

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
setting up TED, small-scale architecture --

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.160
at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.160
the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.160
what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
And our own opportunity to make something new there?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
brought architecture into focus

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
and made it a subject for common conversation.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
a time when five people sat me down at a table

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
safety concerns and whether carpet burns.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
These are just not things we talked about very often.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
we're going to think about it like this.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.160
How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
They've made a selection.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
and now to an even larger instrument,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.160
upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
as you see here.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
after six previous firms struck out

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
with things that were so stupid and banal

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
that even the city of New York was forced to go,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
Right. Can we do this again from the top,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
except use some people with a vague hint of talent,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.160
And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
(Laughter)

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
It's too late. That is gone.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.160
This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.160
because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
But that's what we're going to do.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
But I want you to think about these things

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and that these two things talk about very specifically.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
in trying to decide whether we want architecture

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
from the kind of technocratic solution to everything --

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
or something that's more of a romantic solution.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.160
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
So, in the American tradition,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Cartesian grids spreading across the United States,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
that gives us basically the whole shape

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
of every western state in the United States,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.160
as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.160
in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.160
Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
Manifest destiny.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160
(Laughter)

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.160
it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
the moment they saw one.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.160
and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
(Laughter)

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Why? Why? Why do you want to do that?

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
(Laughter)

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
It's in our nature to go ricocheting

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
back and forth between this technocratic solution

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
So we're going to go straight into this.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Can I have the lights off for a moment?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
that represent the current split, architecturally,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
between these two traditions of a technocratic

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
or technological solution and a romantic solution.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
One very young, one a little more mature.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
This is the work of a firm called SHoP,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
that takes a picture of the outside world --

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
This is just the outline of it, and you can see,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
does it look like a regular building? No.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
square, rectangular, anything like that,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
What's interesting about it is not the shape.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
A brand-new way to put buildings together,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
That's why we all live in developer houses.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
That's because it's cheaper.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
a program that says, manufacture these parts.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
The computer then talks to a machine --

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.160
a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
because the computer is just a machine.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
so the parts can all be cut at the same time.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
like you used to get when you were a child,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
And so what the builder will get is every single individual part

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
and that's what will happen in the end.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
these same architects were asked to produce something

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
as part of their young architects summer series.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
In the summer, you go to the beach.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.160
and that computer program shaped a sand dune

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.160
at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
a set of instructions for pieces of wood.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
What you can see is there's about six different colors,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.160
and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
and there it is fully built.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
There are only 16 different pieces of wood,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
only 16 different assembly parts here.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.160
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
that very important pedestrian connection

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.160
between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160
building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
And they were able to do it. That was their design,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
using that same computer modeling system

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
and only five or six really different kinds of parts,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160
a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and a very simple framing system

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
They were able to create that.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
They were able to create something wonderful.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
using the same technology.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
and you get the same kind of grandeur.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
whose work you can see out here today.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
in a very different fashion.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
into something that you can do, into something that will please you,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
something that will lift your spirits,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
something that will make you feel as if are in another world --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160
which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.160
to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.160
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.160
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
This is happening by itself.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
It transforms through the magic of lighting.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160
Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
up on the Upper West Side,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.160
with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Let's see it one more time.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
in places that you wouldn't have felt good before.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
It's about bringing nature to the inside.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160
In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.160
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
It's about stimulation.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.160
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.160
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.
