00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:20.602
I'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:22.626
because we've got to get better at security

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.646
in this 21st century.

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:29.333
Let me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.002
and kind of get a sense of how that style of security

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.480
worked for us.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.772
This is Verdun, a battlefield in France

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:41.089
just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.705
At Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.833
700,000 people were killed,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.892
so about 2,000 a day.

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:57.220
If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security --

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.123
into the Second World War,

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:02.605
you see the Battle of Stalingrad,

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:06.173
300 days, 2 million people killed.

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.959
We go into the Cold War, and we continue

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.738
to try and build walls.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.790
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.369
to the Maginot Line of the Second World War,

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.798
and then we go into the Cold War,

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.736
the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:26.963
Walls don't work.

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:31.295
My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.951
to create security, we need to build bridges.

00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.375
This is a famous bridge in Europe.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.497
It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.736
It's the bridge over the Drina River,

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:44.562
the subject of a novel by Ivo Andrić,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.320
and it talks about how,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.186
in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans,

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:54.329
over time there's been enormous building of walls.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.420
More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.110
these communities start, hesitatingly,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.663
to come together.

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:06.836
I would argue, again, open-source security

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.672
is about connecting the international,

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:13.419
the interagency, the private-public,

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.184
and lashing it together with strategic communication,

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:19.652
largely in social networks.

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:24.017
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that,

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:27.764
because our global commons is under attack

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.747
in a variety of ways,

00:02:29.747 --> 00:02:33.513
and none of the sources of threat to the global commons

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.342
will be solved by building walls.

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:38.648
Now, I'm a sailor, obviously.

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:43.257
This is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:45.878
What's wrong with this picture?

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:49.389
It's got concertina wire along the sides of it.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.145
That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:55.252
Piracy is a very active threat today

00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:58.581
around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.

00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.372
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.

00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:04.448
It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:06.205
We see it in the Caribbean.

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.992
It's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:12.558
in the global transport system.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:16.013
Last year, at this time, there were 20 vessels,

00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:18.600
500 mariners held hostage.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.223
This is an attack on the global commons.

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:25.009
We need to think about how to address it.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.459
Let's shift to a different kind of sea,

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.837
the cyber sea.

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:33.074
Here are photographs of two young men.

00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:35.471
At the moment, they're incarcerated.

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.950
They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.270
over 10 billion dollars.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.296
This is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:52.322
discontinuity in the global economy.

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:53.668
Two trillion a year.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:57.130
That's just under the GDP of Great Britain.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.057
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly

00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:04.053
is the fundamental piece of radical openness,

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:08.583
is very much under threat as well.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:11.606
Another thing I worry about in the global commons

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:14.366
is the threat posed by trafficking,

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:18.900
by the movement of narcotics, opium,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.264
here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:23.674
over to the United States.

00:04:23.674 --> 00:04:25.831
We worry about cocaine

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.216
coming from the Andean Ridge north.

00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:31.434
We worry about the movement of illegal weapons

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:33.853
and trafficking. Above all, perhaps,

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:37.824
we worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.

00:04:37.824 --> 00:04:40.479
Trafficking moves largely at sea

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.966
but in other parts of the global commons.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:47.579
This is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:52.451
that this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.140
that we're using to stop the trafficking.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.940
The bad news is,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.565
this is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.

00:05:02.565 --> 00:05:06.738
It was built in the jungles of South America.

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:11.600
We caught it with that low-tech raft — (Laughter) —

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.482
and it was carrying six tons of cocaine.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.953
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:25.015
This kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons,

00:05:25.015 --> 00:05:27.920
God forbid, in weapons of mass destruction,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.809
is part of the threat to the global commons.

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.963
And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.709
This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.017
Eighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy,

00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:44.336
opium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:47.115
We also see there, of course, terrorism.

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:49.417
This is where al Qaeda is staged from.

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:54.023
We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.

00:05:54.023 --> 00:05:57.803
So this terrorism concern is also part

00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:01.876
of the global commons, and what we must address.

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:05.189
So here we are, 21st century.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.908
We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.

00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:11.473
What should we do?

00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:16.238
I would argue that we will not deliver security

00:06:16.238 --> 00:06:18.691
solely from the barrel of a gun.

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:22.854
We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.757
We will need the application of military force.

00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:28.851
When we do it, we must do it well, and competently.

00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:35.016
But my thesis is, open-source security is about international,

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:39.551
interagency, private-public connection pulled together

00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:45.840
by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.401
Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.

00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.872
This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.190
They are all holding books.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.994
You should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:04.490
this demographic, young men and women

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.459
in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.200
You would be correct.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.397
Eighty-five percent cannot read

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:16.457
when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:19.604
Why? Because the Taliban withheld education

00:07:19.604 --> 00:07:22.888
during the period of time in which these men and women

00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:24.279
would have learned to read.

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.022
So the question is, so,

00:07:26.022 --> 00:07:29.363
why are they all standing there holding books?

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:33.056
The answer is, we are teaching them to read

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:36.424
in literacy courses by NATO

00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:39.919
in partnership with private sector entities,

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.306
in partnership with development agencies.

00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:47.767
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:50.315
to read and write at a basic level.

00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:53.098
When you can read and write in Afghanistan,

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:56.237
you will typically put a pen in your pocket.

00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:58.825
At the ceremonies, when these young men and women

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:02.369
graduate, they take that pen with great pride,

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:04.469
and put it in their pocket.

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:07.411
This is bringing together international

00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:10.257
— there are 50 nations involved in this mission —

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.103
interagency — these development agencies —

00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:17.193
and private-public, to take on this kind of security.

00:08:17.193 --> 00:08:20.827
Now, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course,

00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:23.595
but I would argue, open-source security

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:26.279
means connecting in ways that create

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:29.131
longer lasting security effect.

00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:31.431
Here's another example.

00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.870
This is a US Navy warship.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.789
It's called the Comfort.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.526
There's a sister ship called the Mercy.

00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:41.661
They are hospital ships.

00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:43.743
This one, the Comfort, operates throughout

00:08:43.743 --> 00:08:47.354
the Caribbean and the coast of South America

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:49.342
conducting patient treatments.

00:08:49.342 --> 00:08:54.083
On a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:57.874
It is crewed not strictly by military

00:08:57.874 --> 00:09:01.778
but by a combination of humanitarian organizations:

00:09:01.778 --> 00:09:05.046
Operation Hope, Project Smile.

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:08.632
Other organizations send volunteers.

00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.887
Interagency physicians come out.

00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:13.016
They're all part of this.

00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:15.921
To give you one example of the impact this can have,

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:19.150
this little boy, eight years old,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.369
walked with his mother two days

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:25.461
to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:30.829
When he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes,

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:33.975
he suddenly looked up and said,

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:37.213
"Mama, veo el mundo."

00:09:37.213 --> 00:09:40.101
"Mom, I see the world."

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.559
Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments,

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:48.228
this private-public collaboration with security forces,

00:09:48.228 --> 00:09:50.297
and you begin to see the power

00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:54.093
of creating security in a very different way.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:58.390
Here you see baseball players.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.210
Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.167
in this photograph?

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.362
They are the two young men on either side

00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:09.377
of these young boys. This is part of a series

00:10:09.377 --> 00:10:13.220
of baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.328
between Major League Baseball,

00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:16.684
the Department of State,

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:19.075
who sets up the diplomatic piece of this,

00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:23.300
military baseball players, who are real soldiers

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.333
with real skills but participate in this mission,

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.235
and they put on clinics

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:31.321
throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,

00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:34.681
in Honduras, in Nicaragua,

00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:39.383
in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations

00:10:39.383 --> 00:10:41.173
where baseball is so popular,

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.429
and it creates security.

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:45.887
It shows role models to young men and women

00:10:45.887 --> 00:10:49.487
about fitness and about life that I would argue

00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:53.652
help create security for us.

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:56.249
Another aspect of this partnership

00:10:56.249 --> 00:10:58.200
is in disaster relief.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.947
This is a US Air Force helicopter participating

00:11:01.947 --> 00:11:08.901
after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:13.412
In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004,

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:20.286
250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005,

00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:22.312
85,000 dead,

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:26.981
the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead,

00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:31.872
more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination

00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:35.236
which struck Japan and its nuclear industry —

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.323
in all of these instances, we see partnerships

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:41.645
between international actors,

00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:45.553
interagency, private-public working with security forces

00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:49.379
to respond to this kind of natural disaster.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:53.731
So these are examples of this idea of open-source security.

00:11:53.731 --> 00:11:58.402
We tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.

00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:01.313
Now, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral,

00:12:01.313 --> 00:12:04.499
these must be sea lanes of communication,

00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:07.299
or these might be fiber optic cables."

00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:12.491
No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.

00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:19.059
Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation.

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:21.105
White is the synthesis.

00:12:21.105 --> 00:12:25.190
It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.937
the six largest nations in the world in descending order:

00:12:28.937 --> 00:12:31.615
China, India, Facebook, the United States,

00:12:31.615 --> 00:12:35.937
Twitter and Indonesia. (Laughter)

00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:37.700
Why do we want to get in these nets?

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.510
Why do we want to be involved?

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.366
We talked earlier about the Arab Spring,

00:12:41.366 --> 00:12:42.767
and the power of all this.

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:44.110
I'll give you another example,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.363
and it's how you move this message.

00:12:46.363 --> 00:12:48.696
I gave a talk like this in London a while back

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:52.084
about this point. I said, as I say to all of you,

00:12:52.084 --> 00:12:54.230
I'm on Facebook. Friend me.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.357
Got a little laugh from the audience.

00:12:56.357 --> 00:13:01.588
There was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.

00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:04.104
Got picked up in two places in the world:

00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:06.452
Finland and Indonesia.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:10.342
The headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.

00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:11.825
(Laughter)

00:13:11.825 --> 00:13:14.369
Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:16.923
Which I do. (Laughter)

00:13:16.923 --> 00:13:19.480
And the story was a catalyst,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.199
and the next morning I had hundreds

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:23.834
of Facebook friend requests

00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:26.351
from Indonesians and Finns,

00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:29.333
mostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend,

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:32.935
and oh, by the way, what is NATO?" (Laughter)

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:34.987
So ... (Laughter)

00:13:34.987 --> 00:13:39.073
Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message,

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:41.808
and moving that message is how we connect

00:13:41.808 --> 00:13:44.259
international, interagency, private-public,

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:48.129
and these social nets to help create security.

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:51.562
Now, let me hit a somber note.

00:13:51.562 --> 00:13:55.320
This is a photograph of a brave British soldier.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.526
He's in the Scots Guards.

00:13:57.526 --> 00:13:59.272
He's standing the watch in Helmand,

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:01.536
in southern Afghanistan.

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:04.192
I put him here to remind us,

00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:07.519
I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:11.732
that we do not need capable, competent militaries

00:14:11.732 --> 00:14:14.967
who can create real military effect.

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:18.062
That is the core of who we are and what we do,

00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:22.118
and we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech,

00:14:22.118 --> 00:14:25.083
all the things we treasure in our societies.

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:29.342
But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.

00:14:29.342 --> 00:14:31.731
You don't have to have a military that is either

00:14:31.731 --> 00:14:35.534
in hard combat or is in the barracks.

00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:40.317
I would argue life is a rheostat.

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:42.846
You have to dial it in,

00:14:42.846 --> 00:14:46.115
and as I think about how we create security

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:48.767
in this 21st century, there will be times

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:53.896
when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis,

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:55.817
but there will be many instances,

00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:57.575
as we've talked about today,

00:14:57.575 --> 00:15:00.767
where our militaries can be part of creating

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:04.821
21st-century security, international,

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.229
interagency, private-public,

00:15:07.229 --> 00:15:11.785
connected with competent communication.

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:16.272
I would close by saying that we heard earlier today

00:15:16.272 --> 00:15:20.235
about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time

00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:23.396
to look up facts, and as all of you appreciate,

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:27.549
Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people

00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:30.024
locked in a room writing articles.

00:15:30.024 --> 00:15:33.737
Wikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people

00:15:33.737 --> 00:15:38.537
inputting information, and every day millions of people

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:40.400
withdrawing that information.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.020
It's a perfect image for the fundamental point

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.642
that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.

00:15:48.642 --> 00:15:52.302
No one person, no one alliance, no one nation,

00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:57.083
no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.

00:15:57.083 --> 00:16:01.765
The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple:

00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:04.879
a world in which every human being can freely share

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:06.512
in the sum of all knowledge.

00:16:06.512 --> 00:16:10.990
My thesis for you is that by combining international,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.160
interagency, private-public, strategic communication,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.625
together, in this 21st century,

00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.892
we can create the sum of all security.

00:16:21.892 --> 00:16:24.349
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:28.575
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
