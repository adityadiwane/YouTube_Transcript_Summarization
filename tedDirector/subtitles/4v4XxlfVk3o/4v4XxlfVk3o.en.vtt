00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So I think data can actually make us more human.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Recently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and the culture of the 21st century

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
will be defined by the interface."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And I believe this is going to prove true.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Our lives are being driven by data,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and the presentation of that data is an opportunity

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that I've been working on over the last couple years

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that reflect on our lives and our systems.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
This is a project called Flight Patterns.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
What you're looking at is airplane traffic

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
over North America for a 24-hour period.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
As you see, everything starts to fade to black,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and you see people going to sleep.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Followed by that, you see on the West coast

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
being monitored by the federal government at any one time,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
but I've color-coded it by type,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and the patterns that are occurring there.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and the blue are higher altitudes.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
You can see this is a major shipping airport,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and there's all kinds of activity there.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
You can also toggle between altitude

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
for model and manufacturer.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
See again, the diversity.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And you can scroll around and see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
This is scrolling up the East coast.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
with the air traffic controllers

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
having to deal with all those major airports next to each other.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So zooming back out real quick,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Moving across to the West coast,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
you see San Francisco and Los Angeles --

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
big low-traffic zones

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
across Nevada and Arizona.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
You see the holding patterns that start to develop

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in the bottom of the screen.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
This is visualizing international communications.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So it's how New York communicates

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
with other international cities.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
so you could see the changing relationship

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and some demographic info

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and CurrentCity.org.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
until we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!"

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Laughter)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So this is an interactive tool

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that you can move around and see different parts of the city.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
to celebrate the night before,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
which happens right here.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And then you can see people celebrating the next day.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So now on to something completely different.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Some of you may recognize this.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
except for one thing: it's not a robot at all.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
There's actually a legless man that sits in that box

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and controls this chess player.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And it's based on the premise that there are certain things

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
So they made this web service and said,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
"Any programmer can write a piece of software

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and tap into the minds of thousands of people."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I can tap into thousands of people's minds."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And the other nerdy side of me thought,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
What does this mean for the future of mankind,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
where we're all plugged into this borg?"

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
I was probably being a little extreme.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and we're just doing these little labors?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
So I created this drawing tool.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution."

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And I started collecting sheep.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Lots of sheep.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
You can't pick individual sheep,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And juxtaposed against this grid,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
you see actually, by rolling over each individual one,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
I think there's something really interesting

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
to watching people as they go through this creative toil --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
something we can all relate to,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
versus this massive distributed grid.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Kind of amazing what some people did.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
So here's a few statistics from the project.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
There were 662 rejected sheep

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
that didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
(Laughter)

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
or were unique IP addresses --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
so about how many people contributed.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
(Laughter)

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Which I was pretty surprised by.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?"

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And I think it's a pretty valid question.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Sheep were the first animal

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
the first to be selectively bred for production traits,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
the first animal to be cloned.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Obviously, we think of sheep as followers.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince"

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
He draws sheep after sheep.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different."

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And I like that.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
during the Industrial Revolution.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
So there were no longer shoe makers,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So I thought this was an interesting clip

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to divide into 16 pieces

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and on the right side you see that frame

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
as interpreted by 16 people

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
who have no idea what it is they're doing.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And this was the inspiration for a project

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
which is making money.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
But here there was no sheep-like criteria.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
People, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
it actually made it into the bill.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
what it was they were asked to do.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
So we took these hundred dollar bills,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
which is now known as One Laptop Per Child.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
This is again showing all the different contributions.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
like this one on top --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
spent a long time making realistic versions.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Here on the right-hand side in the middle

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?"

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
That's all I'm getting paid for this?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
(Laughter)

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
is called Bicycle Built for 2000.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
You may recognize these two guys.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
where they created the song "Daisy Bell,"

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
which was the world's first singing computer.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
You may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
as a reference to when computers became human.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So we resynthesized this song.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
This is what that sounded like.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
We broke down all the individual notes

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Daisy Bell: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ... ♫

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Aaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and we fed them into another Turk request.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
This is what it would look like if you went to the site.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
You type in your code,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
but you first test your mic.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
You'd be fed a simple audio clip.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
(Honk)

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.260

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
AK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
you can actually hear what all this sounds like together.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
I'm sorry for this.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.260
(Noise)

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
AK: So stepping back for a quick second,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
when I was at UCLA going to grad school,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
So basically motion through 3D space.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
who said, "Wait a minute.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So we did exactly that.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
was not just shooting a video with lasers,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
but we also open sourced it,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and we made it released as a Google Code project,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
to build their own versions of it.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And people were making some amazing things.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
This is actually two of my favorites:

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
More recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
which is a little creepy, but pretty cool.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
So with everybody making so much amazing stuff

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and actually understanding what it was they were working on,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
where people were working together to build something.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And we started bouncing around ideas

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
to make a collaborative music video project.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
But we knew we really needed the right person

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to kind of rally behind and build something for.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
called "Ain't No Grave."

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
The lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down."

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So we thought this was the perfect

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
project to build a collaborative memorial

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello, also known as Mr. doob,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
who's a much better programmer than I am,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
As you know,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
an animation is a series of images.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and at eight frames a second,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
we allowed individuals to draw a single frame

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
that would get woven into

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
this dynamically changing music video.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
but I want to show you two short clips.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
One is the beginning of the music video.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And that's going to be followed by a short clip

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
of people who have already contributed to the project

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
talking about it briefly.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:18.260
(Music)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
(Video) Johnny Cash: ♫ There ain't no grave ♫

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.260
♫ can hold my body down ♫

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
♫ There ain't no grave ♫

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
♫ can hold body down ♫

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.260
♫ When I hear the trumpet sound ♫

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
♫ I'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
♫ Ain't no grave ♫

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
♫ can hold my body ... ♫

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
(Applause)

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
AK: What better way to pay tribute to the man

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
than to make something for one of his songs.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And I just thought it'd be wonderful,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
Collaborator Two: It really allows

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
this last recording of his

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.260
to be a living, breathing memorial.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
each individual frame,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
it's got a very powerful feeling to it.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
from Japan, Venezuela, to the States,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
to Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Collaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
it really is personal.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And I just worked and worked through problems,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
all began to resolve themselves.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and a lot of light and dark comes into it.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And in a weird way,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
It's the sum total of his life,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
all the things that had happened --

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
the bad things, the good things.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
You're hearing a person's life.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
what you'll see is the video playing above.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And below it are all the individual frames

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
that people have been submitting to the project.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
So this isn't finished at all,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and where they were located.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And if you find one that you're interested in,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
you can actually click on it and open up an information panel

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
where you're able to rate that frame,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
which helps it bubble up to the top.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And you can also see the way that it was drawn.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
In addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
how long they spent drawing it.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract."

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
But there's a bunch of different styles.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And you can sort the video a number of different ways.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
You can say, "I want to see the pointillist version

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
or the sketchy version or the realistic version.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
And then this is, again, the abstract version,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
which ends up getting a little bit crazy.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Chris and I were really amazed

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
by the potential now with modern web browsers,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
where you have HTML5 audio and video

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
But most importantly, I think,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
to contribute something for everyone.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
What if we had a very low commitment,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
of the home where you grew up.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
And you type in the address --

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
it actually creates a music video specifically for you,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
pulling in Google maps and Streetview images

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
into the experience itself.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.260
(Video) Win Butler: ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.260
♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.260
♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.260
♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.260
♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
♫ Sometimes it never came ♫

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.260
♫ Sometimes it never came ♫

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
♫ Still moving through the pain ♫

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.260
♫ We used to wait for it ♫

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.260
♫ We used to wait for it ♫

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.260
♫ We used to wait for it ♫

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
AK: So I think, if there's one thing to take away from my talk today,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
we have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
as we explore and collaborate together.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Thanks a lot.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.260
(Applause)
