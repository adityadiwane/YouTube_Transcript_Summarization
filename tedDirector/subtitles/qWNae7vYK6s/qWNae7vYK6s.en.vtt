00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.728
"All I wanted was
a much-deserved promotion,

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:18.561
and he told me to 'Get up on the desk

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.116
and spread 'em.'"

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:24.651
"All the men in my office
wrote down on a piece of paper

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.140
the sexual favors
that I could do for them.

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:30.185
All I had asked for
was an office with a window."

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.768
"I asked for his advice about how
I could get a bill out of committee;

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.267
he asked me if I brought my kneepads."

00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:43.991
Those are just a few
of the horrific stories

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.523
that I heard from women
over the last year,

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.726
as I've been investigating
workplace sexual harassment.

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:52.385
And what I found out

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.225
is that it's an epidemic across the world.

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:59.622
It's a horrifying reality
for millions of women,

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:01.760
when all they want to do every day

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.204
is go to work.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.247
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:09.268
You can wear a skirt,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.371
hospital scrubs,

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:12.683
army fatigues.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:14.976
You can be young or old,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.215
married or single,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.429
black or white.

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:20.693
You can be a Republican,
a Democrat or an Independent.

00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:25.483
I heard from so many women:

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:27.403
police officers,

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:28.934
members of our military,

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.415
financial assistants,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.652
actors, engineers, lawyers,

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:36.737
bankers, accountants, teachers ...

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:38.886
journalists.

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:43.722
Sexual harassment, it turns out,

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.633
is not about sex.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.945
It's about power,

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.540
and about what somebody does to you

00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:54.105
to try and take away your power.

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:56.471
And I'm here today

00:01:57.285 --> 00:02:02.209
to encourage you to know
that you can take that power back.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.273
(Applause)

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:10.235
On July 6, 2016,

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.330
I jumped off a cliff all by myself.

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:16.945
It was the scariest moment of my life;

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.995
an excruciating choice to make.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.873
I fell into an abyss all alone,

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:26.749
not knowing what would be below.

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:31.798
But then, something miraculous
started to happen.

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:34.022
Thousands of women
started reaching out to me

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.427
to share their own stories
of pain and agony and shame.

00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:40.387
They told me that I became their voice --

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.942
they were voiceless.

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.583
And suddenly, I realized
that even in the 21st century,

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:50.102
every woman still has a story.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:54.376
Like Joyce,

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.647
a flight attendant supervisor

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.578
whose boss, in meetings every day,

00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:01.739
would tell her about the porn
that he'd watched the night before

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:03.640
while drawing penises on his notepad.

00:03:03.664 --> 00:03:04.840
She went to complain.

00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:06.689
She was called "crazy" and fired.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.635
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.234
Her male colleagues would call her
that vile c-word every day.

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:14.419
She complained --

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:15.784
labeled a troublemaker,

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:18.539
never to do another
Wall Street deal again.

00:03:19.438 --> 00:03:22.048
Like Elizabeth, an army officer.

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:26.311
Her male subordinates would wave
one-dollar bills in her face,

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:28.063
and say, "Dance for me!"

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.415
And when she went to complain to a major,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.983
he said, "What? Only one dollar?

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:35.139
You're worth at least five or ten!"

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:39.965
After reading,

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.576
replying to all

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:46.778
and crying over all of these emails,

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:50.732
I realized I had so much work to do.

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.053
Here are the startling facts:

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:56.129
one in three women -- that we know of --

00:03:56.926 --> 00:03:59.070
have been sexually harassed
in the workplace.

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:05.789
Seventy-one percent of those incidences
never get reported.

00:04:06.874 --> 00:04:08.024
Why?

00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:10.435
Because when women come forward,

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.590
they're still called liars
and troublemakers

00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:14.570
and demeaned and trashed

00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:16.371
and demoted and blacklisted

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:17.766
and fired.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.372
Reporting sexual harassment can be,
in many cases, career-ending.

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:25.289
Of all the women that reached out to me,

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.874
almost none are still today working
in their chosen profession,

00:04:30.898 --> 00:04:32.890
and that is outrageous.

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:39.152
I, too, was silent in the beginning.

00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:44.367
It happened to me at the end
of my year as Miss America,

00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:47.053
when I was meeting with
a very high-ranking TV executive

00:04:47.077 --> 00:04:48.241
in New York City.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:50.493
I thought he was helping me
throughout the day,

00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:51.852
making a lot of phone calls.

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.038
We went to dinner,

00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:55.985
and in the back seat of a car,
he suddenly lunged on top of me

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.782
and stuck his tongue down my throat.

00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:04.356
I didn't realize that to "get
into the business" -- silly me --

00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:08.111
he also intended to get into my pants.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:11.930
And just a week later,

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:16.532
when I was in Los Angeles
meeting with a high-ranking publicist,

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.075
it happened again.

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.415
Again, in a car.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.410
And he took my neck in his hand,

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:25.496
and he shoved my head
so hard into his crotch,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.109
I couldn't breathe.

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:38.622
These are the events that suck the life
out of all of your self-confidence.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.866
These are the events that, until recently,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.271
I didn't even call assault.

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:55.366
And this is why we have
so much work to do.

00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:01.400
After my year as Miss America,

00:06:01.424 --> 00:06:03.840
I continued to meet
a lot of well-known people,

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.511
including Donald Trump.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.348
When this picture was taken in 1988,

00:06:10.372 --> 00:06:12.936
nobody could have ever predicted
where we'd be today.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.110
(Laughter)

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:18.486
Me, fighting to end sexual
harassment in the workplace;

00:06:19.357 --> 00:06:21.793
he, president of the United States

00:06:21.817 --> 00:06:23.089
in spite of it.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.297
And shortly thereafter, I got
my first gig in television news

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.474
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:33.279
Check out that confident smile
with the bright pink jacket.

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:34.530
Not so much the hair.

00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:35.704
(Laughter)

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:41.169
I was working so hard to prove
that blondes have a lot of brains.

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:45.660
But ironically, one of the first
stories I covered

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:48.225
was the Anita Hill hearings
in Washington, DC.

00:06:48.663 --> 00:06:50.227
And shortly thereafter,

00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:53.199
I, too, was sexually harassed
in the workplace.

00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:56.488
I was covering a story in rural Virginia,

00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:58.182
and when we got back into the car,

00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:00.085
my cameraman started saying to me,

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:02.980
wondering how much I had enjoyed
when he touched my breasts

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:04.577
when he put the microphone on me.

00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:06.388
And it went downhill from there.

00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:09.291
I was bracing myself
against the passenger door --

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:10.848
this was before cellphones.

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:12.118
I was petrified.

00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:16.204
I actually envisioned myself
rolling outside of that door

00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:19.457
as the car was going 50 miles per hour
like I'd seen in the movies,

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.588
and wondering how much it would hurt.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.862
When the story about
Harvey Weinstein came to light --

00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:32.305
one the most well-known
movie moguls in all of Hollywood --

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:34.265
the allegations were horrific.

00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:36.849
But so many women came forward,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.497
and it made me realize
what I had done meant something.

00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:46.506
(Applause)

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:50.274
He had such a lame excuse.

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:53.194
He said he was a product
of the '60s and '70s,

00:07:53.218 --> 00:07:54.974
and that that was the culture then.

00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:56.877
Yeah, that was the culture then,

00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.798
and unfortunately, it still is.

00:07:59.822 --> 00:08:00.972
Why?

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.150
Because of all the myths

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.469
that are still associated
with sexual harassment.

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:10.239
"Women should just take another job
and find another career."

00:08:10.263 --> 00:08:11.417
Yeah, right.

00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:13.608
Tell that to the single mom
working two jobs,

00:08:13.632 --> 00:08:15.051
trying to make ends meet,

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.925
who's also being sexually harassed.

00:08:18.082 --> 00:08:19.627
"Women --

00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:21.422
they bring it on themselves."

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:23.571
By the clothes that we wear

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:25.238
and the makeup that we put on.

00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:29.431
Yeah, I guess those hoodies
that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:31.218
are just so provocative.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:33.939
"Women make it up."

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:37.549
Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding

00:08:37.573 --> 00:08:40.158
to be demeaned and taken down.

00:08:40.182 --> 00:08:41.422
I would know.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:47.920
"Women bring these claims
because they want to be famous and rich."

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.267
Our own president said that.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.286
I bet Taylor Swift,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.035
one of the most well-known
and richest singers in the world,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.328
didn't need more money or fame

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.557
when she came forward
with her groping case

00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.967
for one dollar.

00:09:04.688 --> 00:09:06.771
And I'm so glad she did.

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:10.726
Breaking news:

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.310
the untold story about women
and sexual harassment in the workplace:

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.498
women just want a safe, welcoming

00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:22.032
and harass-free environment.

00:09:22.056 --> 00:09:23.257
That's it.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.967
(Applause)

00:09:30.405 --> 00:09:33.476
So how do we go about
getting our power back?

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.022
I have three solutions.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:36.817
Number one:

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:41.460
we need to turn bystanders
and enablers into allies.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.918
Ninety-eight percent of United States
corporations right now

00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:47.065
have sexual harassment training policies.

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:50.418
Seventy percent have prevention programs.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.079
But still, overwhelmingly,

00:09:53.103 --> 00:09:56.349
bystanders and witnesses
don't come forward.

00:09:57.225 --> 00:09:58.377
In 2016,

00:09:58.401 --> 00:10:02.335
the Harvard Business Review
called it the "bystander effect."

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.686
And yet -- remember 9/11.

00:10:07.227 --> 00:10:09.780
Millions of times we've heard,

00:10:09.804 --> 00:10:11.208
"If you see something,

00:10:11.232 --> 00:10:12.620
say something."

00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:17.691
Imagine how impactful that would be
if we carried that through

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:20.754
to bystanders in the workplace
regarding sexual harassment --

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:25.322
to recognize and interrupt
these incidences;

00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:29.699
to confront the perpetrators
to their face;

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.511
to help and protect the victims.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.272
This is my shout-out to men:

00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:38.935
we need you in this fight.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.185
And to women, too --

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:44.005
enablers to allies.

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:45.855
Number two:

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.294
change the laws.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:50.467
How many of you out there know

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:52.910
whether or not you have
a forced arbitration clause

00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:54.832
in your employment contract?

00:10:56.095 --> 00:10:57.245
Not a lot of hands.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:58.997
And if you don't know, you should,

00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:00.251
and here's why.

00:11:01.096 --> 00:11:02.352
TIME Magazine calls it,

00:11:02.376 --> 00:11:04.015
right there on the screen,

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:07.394
"The teeny tiny little print in contracts

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:10.801
that keeps sexual
harassment claims unheard."

00:11:11.646 --> 00:11:13.015
Here's what it is.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.833
Forced arbitration takes away
your Seventh Amendment right

00:11:15.857 --> 00:11:17.278
to an open jury process.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.000
It's secret.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.400
You don't get the same
witnesses or depositions.

00:11:22.424 --> 00:11:25.269
In many cases, the company
picks the arbitrator for you.

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:28.331
There are no appeals,

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.157
and only 20 percent of the time
does the employee win.

00:11:31.927 --> 00:11:33.559
But again, it's secret,

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:36.529
so nobody ever knows what happened to you.

00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:39.748
This is why I've been
working so diligently

00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:41.404
on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC

00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:42.580
to change the laws.

00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:44.420
And here's what I tell the Senators:

00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:46.440
sexual harassment is apolitical.

00:11:46.464 --> 00:11:48.043
Before somebody harasses you,

00:11:48.067 --> 00:11:51.801
they don't ask you if you're
a Republican or Democrat first.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.119
They just do it.

00:11:53.143 --> 00:11:55.585
And this is why we should all care.

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.535
Number three:

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.090
be fierce.

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:02.269
It starts when we stand tall,

00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:04.255
and we build that self-confidence.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.077
And we stand up and we speak up,

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.479
and we tell the world what happened to us.

00:12:09.932 --> 00:12:11.933
I know it's scary,

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:13.737
but let's do it for our kids.

00:12:14.102 --> 00:12:16.956
Let's stop this for the next generations.

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:21.498
I know that I did it for my children.

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.045
They were paramount in my decision-making

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:27.277
about whether or not I would come forward.

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:28.917
My beautiful children,

00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:30.704
my 12-year-old son, Christian,

00:12:30.728 --> 00:12:32.894
my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.985
And boy, did I underestimate them.

00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:37.740
The first day of school last year

00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:40.177
happened to be the day
my resolution was announced,

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:42.462
and I was so anxious
about what they would face.

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:44.699
My daughter came home
from school and she said,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.101
"Mommy, so many people asked me
what happened to you over the summer."

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.746
Then she looked at me in the eyes

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.267
and she said, "And mommy,

00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:52.817
I was so proud

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:56.354
to say that you were my mom."

00:12:58.749 --> 00:13:00.009
And two weeks later,

00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:03.987
when she finally found the courage
to stand up to two kids

00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:06.059
who had been making her life miserable,

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:07.698
she came home to me and she said,

00:13:07.722 --> 00:13:11.170
"Mommy, I found the courage to do it

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.489
because I saw you do it."

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:23.052
(Applause)

00:13:24.487 --> 00:13:28.384
You see, giving the gift
of courage is contagious.

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:33.733
And I hope that my journey
has inspired you,

00:13:33.757 --> 00:13:36.520
because right now, it's the tipping point.

00:13:36.922 --> 00:13:39.234
We are watching history happen.

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:41.662
More and more women
are coming forward and saying,

00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:43.460
"Enough is enough."

00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:49.742
(Applause)

00:13:51.412 --> 00:13:54.050
Here's my one last plea to companies.

00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:59.003
Let's hire back all those women
whose careers were lost

00:13:59.027 --> 00:14:01.036
because of some random jerk.

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.172
Because here's what I know about women:

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:09.273
we will not longer be underestimated,
intimidated or set back;

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:13.233
we will not be silenced
by the ways of the establishment

00:14:13.257 --> 00:14:15.185
or the relics of the past.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:16.359
No.

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:19.442
We will stand up and speak up

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:21.942
and have our voices heard.

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:26.517
We will be the women we were meant to be.

00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:29.914
And above all,

00:14:29.938 --> 00:14:33.669
we will always be fierce.

00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:35.370
Thank you.

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:40.626
(Applause)
