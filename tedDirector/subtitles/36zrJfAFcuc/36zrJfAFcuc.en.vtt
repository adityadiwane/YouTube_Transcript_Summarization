00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:14.600
[His Holiness Pope Francis
Filmed in Vatican City

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.120
First shown at TED2017]

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.800
Good evening – or, good morning,
I am not sure what time it is there.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.360
Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled
to be participating in your conference.

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:36.280
I very much like its title
– "The Future You" –

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.200
because, while looking at tomorrow,
it invites us to open a dialogue today,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.640
to look at the future through a "you."

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:52.350
"The Future You:"

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.640
the future is made of yous,
it is made of encounters,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.040
because life flows
through our relations with others.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.176
Quite a few years of life

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.696
have strengthened my conviction

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.720
that each and everyone's existence
is deeply tied to that of others:

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.259
life is not time merely passing by,
life is about interactions.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.440
As I meet, or lend an ear
to those who are sick,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.176
to the migrants
who face terrible hardships

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
in search of a brighter future,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.120
to prison inmates who carry
a hell of pain inside their hearts,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.880
and to those, many of them young,
who cannot find a job,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.560
I often find myself wondering:

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.375
"Why them and not me?"

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:04.748
I, myself, was born
in a family of migrants;

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.776
my father, my grandparents,
like many other Italians,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.856
left for Argentina

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.360
and met the fate of those
who are left with nothing.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.960
I could have very well ended up
among today's "discarded" people.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.437
And that's why I always ask myself,
deep in my heart:

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.739
"Why them and not me?"

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.536
First and foremost, I would love it
if this meeting could help to remind us

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.400
that we all need each other,

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:47.878
none of us is an island,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.320
an autonomous and independent "I,"
separated from the other,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.160
and we can only build the future
by standing together, including everyone.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.976
We don’t think about it often,
but everything is connected,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.440
and we need to restore
our connections to a healthy state.

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:16.522
Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:19.616
against my brother or my sister,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.696
the open wound that was never cured,
the offense that was never forgiven,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.736
the rancor that is only going to hurt me,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.062
are all instances of a fight
that I carry within me,

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:32.776
a flare deep in my heart
that needs to be extinguished

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.480
before it goes up in flames,
leaving only ashes behind.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.360
Many of us, nowadays,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
seem to believe that a happy future
is something impossible to achieve.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.920
While such concerns
must be taken very seriously,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.115
they are not invincible.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.600
They can be overcome when we don't lock
our door to the outside world.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360
Happiness can only be discovered

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.720
as a gift of harmony between the whole
and each single component.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.840
Even science – and you know it
better than I do –

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.576
points to an understanding of reality

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.600
as a place where every element connects
and interacts with everything else.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.960
And this brings me to my second message.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.360
How wonderful would it be

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:42.600
if the growth of scientific
and technological innovation

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.480
would come along with more equality
and social inclusion.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.760
How wonderful would it be,
while we discover faraway planets,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.261
to rediscover the needs of the brothers
and sisters orbiting around us.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.296
How wonderful would it be if solidarity,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.840
this beautiful and, at times,
inconvenient word,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.736
were not simply reduced to social work,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.416
and became, instead, the default attitude

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.200
in political, economic
and scientific choices,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.056
as well as in the relationships
among individuals, peoples and countries.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.088
Only by educating people
to a true solidarity

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:38.788
will we be able to overcome

00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:42.159
the "culture of waste,"

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.640
which doesn't concern only food and goods

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.896
but, first and foremost, the people

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.000
who are cast aside
by our techno-economic systems

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.240
which, without even realizing it,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.886
are now putting products
at their core, instead of people.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Solidarity is a term that many wish
to erase from the dictionary.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.520
Solidarity, however,
is not an automatic mechanism.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.720
It cannot be programmed or controlled.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.480
It is a free response born
from the heart of each and everyone.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.160
Yes, a free response!

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.256
When one realizes

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.016
that life, even in the middle
of so many contradictions, is a gift,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.760
that love is the source
and the meaning of life,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.703
how can they withhold their urge
to do good to another fellow being?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.656
In order to do good,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.840
we need memory, we need courage
and we need creativity.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.000
And I know that TED
gathers many creative minds.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.957
Yes, love does require
a creative, concrete

00:07:16.012 --> 00:07:17.810
and ingenious attitude.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.661
Good intentions and conventional formulas,

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:30.085
so often used to appease
our conscience, are not enough.

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:34.096
Let us help each other,
all together, to remember

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.760
that the other is not
a statistic or a number.

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:41.440
The other has a face.

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:46.389
The "you" is always a real presence,

00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:49.576
a person to take care of.

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:58.656
There is a parable Jesus told
to help us understand the difference

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:05.510
between those who'd rather not be bothered
and those who take care of the other.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.140
I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.400
When Jesus was asked:
"Who is my neighbor?" -

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.480
namely, "Who should I take care of?" -

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.857
he told this story, the story of a man

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:32.720
who had been assaulted, robbed,
beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.240
Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
two very influential people of the time,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.440
walked past him without stopping to help.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.518
After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.

00:08:52.593 --> 00:08:57.976
Seeing the injured man
lying on the ground,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.440
he did not ignore him
as if he weren't even there.

00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:06.493
Instead, he felt compassion for this man,

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:14.567
which compelled him to act
in a very concrete manner.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.010
He poured oil and wine
on the wounds of the helpless man,

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:22.776
brought him to a hostel

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.120
and paid out of his pocket
for him to be assisted.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.520
The story of the Good Samaritan
is the story of today’s humanity.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.496
People's paths are riddled with suffering,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.520
as everything is centered around money,
and things, instead of people.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.456
And often there is this habit, by people
who call themselves "respectable,"

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.055
of not taking care of the others,

00:09:53.702 --> 00:10:00.540
thus leaving behind thousands
of human beings, or entire populations,

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.860
on the side of the road.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.068
Fortunately, there are also those
who are creating a new world

00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:15.320
by taking care of the other,
even out of their own pockets.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.241
Mother Teresa actually said:

00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:25.122
"One cannot love,
unless it is at their own expense."

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.270
We have so much to do,
and we must do it together.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.420
But how can we do that
with all the evil we breathe every day?

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:40.228
Thank God,

00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:44.586
no system can nullify our desire
to open up to the good,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.629
to compassion and to our capacity
to react against evil,

00:10:48.653 --> 00:10:51.089
all of which stem
from deep within our hearts.

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:52.537
Now you might tell me,

00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.256
"Sure, these are beautiful words,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.018
but I am not the Good Samaritan,
nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta."

00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:04.084
On the contrary: we are precious,
each and every one of us.

00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:09.310
Each and every one of us
is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.056
Through the darkness of today's conflicts,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.616
each and every one of us
can become a bright candle,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.798
a reminder that light
will overcome darkness,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.010
and never the other way around.

00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:32.933
To Christians,
the future does have a name,

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:35.837
and its name is Hope.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.800
Feeling hopeful does not mean
to be optimistically naïve

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.520
and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.736
Hope is the virtue of a heart

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.816
that doesn't lock itself into darkness,
that doesn't dwell on the past,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.200
does not simply get by in the present,
but is able to see a tomorrow.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.976
Hope is the door
that opens onto the future.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.256
Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.520
that, with time,
will develop into a large tree.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.000
It is like some invisible yeast
that allows the whole dough to grow,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.000
that brings flavor to all aspects of life.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.808
And it can do so much,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.621
because a tiny flicker of light
that feeds on hope

00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:41.160
is enough to shatter
the shield of darkness.

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:47.216
A single individual
is enough for hope to exist,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.424
and that individual can be you.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.014
And then there will be another "you,"
and another "you,"

00:12:58.102 --> 00:13:00.403
and it turns into an "us."

00:13:01.058 --> 00:13:05.315
And so, does hope begin
when we have an "us?"

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.483
No.

00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:08.127
Hope began with one "you."

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.710
When there is an "us,"
there begins a revolution.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.496
The third message
I would like to share today

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.760
is, indeed, about revolution:
the revolution of tenderness.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.520
And what is tenderness?

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.976
It is the love that comes close
and becomes real.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.176
It is a movement
that starts from our heart

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.880
and reaches the eyes,
the ears and the hands.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.800
Tenderness means to use
our eyes to see the other,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.141
our ears to hear the other,

00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:53.449
to listen to the children, the poor,
those who are afraid of the future.

00:13:53.473 --> 00:13:59.216
To listen also to the silent cry
of our common home,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.360
of our sick and polluted earth.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.680
Tenderness means to use
our hands and our heart

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.400
to comfort the other,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.240
to take care of those in need.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.106
Tenderness is the language
of the young children,

00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:22.476
of those who need the other.

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:28.776
A child’s love for mom and dad

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.720
grows through their touch, their gaze,
their voice, their tenderness.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.856
I like when I hear parents

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.680
talk to their babies,
adapting to the little child,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.480
sharing the same level of communication.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.560
This is tenderness:
being on the same level as the other.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.440
God himself descended into Jesus
to be on our level.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.960
This is the same path
the Good Samaritan took.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.040
This is the path that Jesus himself took.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.070
He lowered himself,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.176
he lived his entire human existence

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.880
practicing the real,
concrete language of love.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.576
Yes, tenderness is the path of choice

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.640
for the strongest,
most courageous men and women.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.920
Tenderness is not weakness;
it is fortitude.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.000
It is the path of solidarity,
the path of humility.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.960
Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.496
the more powerful you are,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.480
the more your actions
will have an impact on people,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.240
the more responsible you are
to act humbly.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.800
If you don’t, your power will ruin you,
and you will ruin the other.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.903
There is a saying in Argentina:

00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:16.714
"Power is like drinking gin
on an empty stomach."

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.080
You feel dizzy, you get drunk,
you lose your balance,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.000
and you will end up hurting yourself
and those around you,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.280
if you don’t connect your power
with humility and tenderness.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.320
Through humility and concrete love,
on the other hand,

00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:50.984
power – the highest, the strongest one –
becomes a service, a force for good.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.560
The future of humankind isn't exclusively
in the hands of politicians,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.640
of great leaders, of big companies.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.056
Yes, they do hold
an enormous responsibility.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.896
But the future is, most of all,
in the hands of those people

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.413
who recognize the other as a "you"

00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:18.091
and themselves as part of an "us."

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.040
We all need each other.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.376
And so, please, think of me
as well with tenderness,

00:17:27.973 --> 00:17:31.347
so that I can fulfill the task
I have been given

00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.793
for the good of the other,

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:37.156
of each and every one, of all of you,

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.256
of all of us.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.568
Thank you.
