00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
quickly start out with

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
a little bit of music here. (Applause)

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.160
(Music)

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.160
(Applause)

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Thank you! (Applause)

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
I took my shoes off to dance,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
but maybe I'll get at that later.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Anyways, I... where to start?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Well, I'm really excited

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
to talk a bit about

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
my own upbringing in music

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
and family and all of that,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
but I'm even more excited for you people

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
to hear about Donnell's amazing family

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
and maybe even a little bit about

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
how we met,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
and all that sort of thing,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
but for those of you that may not

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
be familiar with my upbringing,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
I'm from Cape Breton Island,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
which is a very, very musical island,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
and its origins come from Scotland

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
with the music and all the traditions,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
the dancing, the language,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
which unfortunately is dying out

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
in Cape Breton.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
The traditional language is Gaelic,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
but a lot of the music came

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
from the Gaelic language,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and the dancing and the singing

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and everything, and my bloodline

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
is Scottish through and through,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
but my mother and father

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
are two very, very musical people.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
My mom taught me to dance

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
when I was five, and my dad

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
My uncle is a very well-known

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Cape Breton fiddler.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
His name's Buddy MacMaster,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
and just a wonderful guy,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
and we have a great tradition at home

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
called square dancing,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
and we had parties, great parties

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
at our house and the neighbors' houses,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
but kitchen party

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
in Cape Breton is very common,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
and basically somebody drops into the house,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
and no matter what house you go to

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
guaranteed, and I'd say,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
well there's first of all more fiddlers

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
in the world, so ten chances to one,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
the fellow who walked in the door

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
could play it, so you'd have someone come

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
into the house, you'd invite them to play

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
a tune, and lo and behold

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
a little party would start up and somebody would dance,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
so it was a wonderful, wonderful way

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
to grow up, and that is where

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
my beginnings in music come from:

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
my surroundings, my family,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
I've done lots of things with my music.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
I've recorded lots of CDs.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I was nominated for a Grammy and

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
I've won some awards and stuff like that,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
so that's awesome,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
but the best part was meeting my husband,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
and I've actually known Donnell

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
for probably 12 years now, and

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
how music brought us together,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
but I'm going to introduce you

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
right now to my new husband

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
as of October 5,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Donnell Leahy. (Applause)

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:01.160
(Applause)

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
experience and I'm glad to be here,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
but I'm just trying to put it all together,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
trying to figure all you people out, and I've

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
been here for a short while, and I'm starting

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
to understand a little bit better.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
So I asked Natalie, what do I do?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And she said, just talk about yourself.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
and we grew up on a farm.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
and I'm the oldest boy.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
There are four girls a little bit older than me.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
We grew up without a television.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
People find that strange,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
but I think it was a great blessing for us.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
We had a television for a few years,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
but of course we wasted so much time

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
and the work wasn't getting done,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
so out went the television.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
We grew up playing—

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
Mom and Natalie's mother

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
knew each other. We grew up playing,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
and used to dance together, right, yeah.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
we played by ear and I think

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
that's important for us because

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
we were not really exposed to a lot of

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
different styles of music.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
We learned to play the instruments,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
but we kind of had to come from within

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
or go from within, because we didn't

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
radio. We went to church

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and to school sometimes,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
and farmed and played music,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
so we were able, I think,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
at a very critical age to develop

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
our own style, our own self,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
and my mother plays, my father plays,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
and the style that came

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
we call it French-Canadian style

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
but it originated in logging camps.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Years ago, hundreds of men would go

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
up for the winter to the camps

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
in Northern Ontario and in Quebec,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
and they were all different cultures,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
and the Irish, the French, Scottish,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
German, they'd all meet, and of course

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
at night, they'd play cards

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
and step dance and play fiddles,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
and over the course of many years,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
and the Ottawa Valley step dancing

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
evolved, so that's, I kind of started out

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
with that style and I quickly

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
started doing my own thing,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
and then I met Natalie, and I was

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
That's how we met. (Laughter)

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
You tell them. (Laughter)

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
NM: You want to or no? (Laughter)

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Well I guess I have to now.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Well, it's just so interesting that

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
Donnell's upbringing was very similar

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
when I was about 12 years old,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and he and his family came to

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
Inverness, which is about 45 minutes

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
from where I lived, and I was just

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
blown away, like, it was just amazing,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and you'll find out why pretty soon here,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
but I couldn't believe the fiddling

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
and Mom was there with me,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
and she was saying —

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
Donnell's mother came up on stage

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
and danced with her children, and Mom

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
I used to dance with her when we

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
were kids. Little did I think our children

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
would be playing instruments, you know,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
playing music, yeah."

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
her kids would be getting married,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
but anyway, so, then I got

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
a phone call about, I dunno,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160
seven years later. I was 19,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.160
first or second year of college,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and it was Donnell, and

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
he said "Hi, you probably don't know me

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
but my name is Donnell Leahy."

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And I said, "I know you.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
I have a tape of yours at home."

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,"

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
which is where I was,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
and he asked me out for supper.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
That's it. (Laughter)

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
(Applause)

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs)

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
(Laughter)

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Then we dated for two years,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
broke up for 10, got back together

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and got married. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
so I'll just get to it.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
I starts out with a slow air.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
Airs were played in Europe

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
at burials, as a body was carried out

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
from the wake site to the burial site,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
the procession was led by a piper

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
or a fiddle player.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
I'll quickly play a short part of the air,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
and then I'm going to get into

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
to play when you're not warmed up,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
anyway. It's called The Banks.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:21.160
(Tuning)

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
(Laughter)

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:38.160
(Music)

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:56.160
(Applause)

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
NM: Well, we're gonna play one

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
together now. (Applause)

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160
We're laughing, like, because

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
our styles are totally different,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
as you can hear.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And so, you know, Donnell and I

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
are actually in the process of

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
writing new pieces of music together

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
that we can play,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160
but we don't have any of those ready.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
We just started yesterday. (Laughter)

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
So we're gonna play something together anyway.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
DL: With one minute.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
NM: With one minute.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
(Audience reaction)

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
because you've got to do your thing.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.160
(Music)

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:56.160
(Tuning)

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
the bird pose right now. (Laughter)

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:21.160
(Music)

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:48.160
(Audience claps along)

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:50.160
(Applause)

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160
Announcer: Great news,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160
they're running late downstairs.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
We've got another 10 minutes.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:04.160
(Applause)

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.160
NM: Okay. Sure.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
All right, okay.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
Let's get her going. (Applause)

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:23.160
(Tuning)

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
DL: What do you want to play?

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160
NM: Well, um...

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:36.160
(Music) (Laughter)

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
NM: Uh, sure.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
DL: How fast?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
NM: Not too fast.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:58.160
(Music)

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.160
(Audience claps along)

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160
(Cheering)

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:14.160
(Audience claps along)

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.160
(Music)

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:47.160
(Applause)

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.160
DL: We're going to play a tune

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.160
and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
The Cape Breton piano playing

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160
is just awesome. It's very rhythmic

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160
and, you'll see it.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.160
My mom plays piano, and she learned

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.160
to play before they had a piano at home

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.160
in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160
a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.160
the rhythms on a piece of board,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
and the fiddlers would all congregate

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
to play on the cold winter's evenings

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.160
and Mom would be banging on this board,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.160
so when they bought a piano,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.160
they bought it in Toronto and had it taken

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.160
by train and brought in on a horse,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160
a horse and sleigh to the house.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
It became the only piano in the region,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.160
and Mom said she could basically play

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.160
as soon as the piano arrived,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.160
she could play it because she had learned

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160
all these rhythms. Anyway, we found

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.160
the piano last year and were able to

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.160
bring it back home. We purchased it.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160
It had gone through, like,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
five or six families,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160
and it was just a big thing for us,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.160
and we found actually an old picture

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.160
of somebody and their family years ago.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.160
DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.160
NM: Just tell them what—

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.160
DL: She wants me to talk about—

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160
We have a band named Leahy.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
There's 11 siblings. We, um—

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.160
What will I tell them? (Laughter)

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.160
We opened—

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.160
NM: No surgeries.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.160
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.160
We had a great opportunity.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.160
We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
It was a big thing for us, and now

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.160
all my sisters are off having babies

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.160
and the boys are all getting married, so we're

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
staying close to home for, I guess,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.160
another couple of weeks.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.160
What can I say? I don't know what to say,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.160
Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.160
(Laughter)

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.160
NM: Is this what marriage is about?

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.160
(Applause)

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.160
I like it. (Applause)

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.160
(Laughter)

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160
DL: Oh yeah, okay,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.160
in my family we had seven girls, four boys,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.160
we had two fiddles and one piano,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.160
and of course we were all fighting to play

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.160
on the instruments, so dad and mom

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160
set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.160
off the instrument. You had to wait

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.160
until they were finished, so of course,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.160
what we would do is we'd get on the piano

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.160
and you wouldn't even get off to eat,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160
because you wouldn't want to give it up

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.160
to your brother or sister, and they'd wait

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.160
and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.160
and you'd be still sitting there on the piano,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.160
but it was their way to get us to practice.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.160
Will we play a tune?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
NM: It worked. DL: It worked.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.160
Sorry, I hate to carry on...

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.160
So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.160
Okay, play in, how about A?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:03.160
(Music)

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:15.160
(Applause)
