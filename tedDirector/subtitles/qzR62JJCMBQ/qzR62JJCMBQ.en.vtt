00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:18.309
We live in an incredibly busy world.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.830
The pace of life is often frantic,
our minds are always busy,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.601
and we're always doing something.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.747
So with that in mind,
I'd like you just to take a moment

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:31.361
to think, when did you last take
any time to do nothing?

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.306
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:36.861
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.481
So that's no emailing,
texting, no Internet,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.281
no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.

00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:45.849
Not even sitting there
reminiscing about the past

00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:47.237
or planning for the future.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.634
Simply doing nothing.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.259
I see a lot of very blank faces.

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:54.284
(Laughter)

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:56.227
You probably have to go a long way back.

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.259
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?

00:00:58.283 --> 00:00:59.705
We're talking about our mind.

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:03.667
The mind, our most valuable
and precious resource,

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.730
through which we experience
every single moment of our life.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:09.859
The mind that we rely upon

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:14.357
to be happy, content,
emotionally stable as individuals,

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.761
and at the same time,
to be kind and thoughtful

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.935
and considerate
in our relationships with others.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.597
This is the same mind that we depend upon

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.093
to be focused, creative, spontaneous,

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:29.791
and to perform at our very best
in everything that we do.

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:33.772
And yet, we don't take
any time out to look after it.

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:37.286
In fact, we spend more time
looking after our cars,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.293
our clothes and our hair than we --

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:40.564
okay, maybe not our hair,

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:41.589
(Laughter)

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:43.063
but you see where I'm going.

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:45.740
The result, of course,
is that we get stressed.

00:01:46.074 --> 00:01:48.799
You know, the mind whizzes away
like a washing machine

00:01:48.823 --> 00:01:52.215
going round and round,
lots of difficult, confusing emotions,

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.271
and we don't really know
how to deal with that.

00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:01.040
And the sad fact
is that we are so distracted

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:04.860
that we're no longer present
in the world in which we live.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.927
We miss out on the things
that are most important to us,

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.358
and the crazy thing
is that everybody just assumes,

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:14.721
that's the way life is, so we've just
kind of got to get on with it.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:16.524
That's really not how it has to be.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.944
So I was about 11 when I went along
to my first meditation class.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.619
And trust me, it had all the stereotypes
that you can imagine,

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:27.014
the sitting cross-legged on the floor,

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:30.413
the incense, the herbal tea,
the vegetarians, the whole deal,

00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:34.206
but my mom was going and I was intrigued,
so I went along with her.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.211
I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:39.581
and secretly I kind of thought
I might be able to learn how to fly,

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:41.703
but I was very young at the time.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.406
Now as I was there, I guess,
like a lot of people,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.070
I assumed that it was just
an aspirin for the mind.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:51.047
You get stressed, you do some meditation.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:54.892
I hadn't really thought that it could be
sort of preventative in nature,

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:58.551
until I was about 20, when a number
of things happened in my life

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.985
in quite quick succession,

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.452
really serious things
which just flipped my life upside down

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.374
and all of a sudden
I was inundated with thoughts,

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:10.955
inundated with difficult emotions
that I didn't know how to cope with.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.995
Every time I sort of pushed one down,

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.820
another one would pop back up again.

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:16.655
It was a really very stressful time.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.355
I guess we all deal with stress
in different ways.

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:25.448
Some people will bury themselves in work,
grateful for the distraction.

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.294
Others will turn to their friends,
their family, looking for support.

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.534
Some people hit the bottle,
start taking medication.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.744
My own way of dealing with it
was to become a monk.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.893
So I quit my degree,
I headed off to the Himalayas,

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.656
I became a monk, and I started
studying meditation.

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:47.470
People often ask me
what I learned from that time.

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:49.706
Well, obviously it changed things.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.720
Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk
is going to change a number of things.

00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:55.992
But it was more than that.

00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:59.639
It taught me -- it gave me
a greater appreciation,

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:02.885
an understanding for the present moment.

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:07.258
By that I mean not being lost in thought,

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.094
not being distracted,

00:04:09.118 --> 00:04:12.909
not being overwhelmed
by difficult emotions,

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.462
but instead learning how to be
in the here and now,

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:18.837
how to be mindful, how to be present.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.419
I think the present moment
is so underrated.

00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:24.648
It sounds so ordinary,

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:28.367
and yet we spend so little time
in the present moment

00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.732
that it's anything but ordinary.

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:34.541
There was a research paper that came
out of Harvard, just recently,

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.331
that said on average, our minds
are lost in thought

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:39.718
almost 47 percent of the time.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.641
47 percent.

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:45.236
At the same time, this sort
of constant mind-wandering

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.895
is also a direct cause of unhappiness.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.963
Now we're not here for that long anyway,

00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:57.189
but to spend almost half
of our life lost in thought

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.195
and potentially quite unhappy,

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.892
I don't know, it just kind
of seems tragic, actually,

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:04.849
especially when there's something
we can do about it,

00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:08.497
when there's a positive,
practical, achievable,

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.481
scientifically proven technique

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:13.707
which allows our mind to be more healthy,

00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:17.335
to be more mindful and less distracted.

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.274
And the beauty of it is that even though

00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:22.673
it need only take about 10 minutes a day,

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.417
it impacts our entire life.

00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:28.151
But we need to know how to do it.

00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:29.411
We need an exercise.

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:32.553
We need a framework
to learn how to be more mindful.

00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:34.476
That's essentially what meditation is.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.991
It's familiarizing ourselves
with the present moment.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:40.046
But we also need to know
how to approach it in the right way

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.443
to get the best from it.

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.897
And that's what these are for,
in case you've been wondering,

00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.158
because most people assume

00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:49.913
that meditation
is all about stopping thoughts,

00:05:49.937 --> 00:05:52.974
getting rid of emotions,
somehow controlling the mind,

00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:55.172
but actually it's quite
different from that.

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:57.959
It's more about stepping back,

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.319
sort of seeing the thought clearly,

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.058
witnessing it coming and going,
emotions coming and going

00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:08.059
without judgment,
but with a relaxed, focused mind.

00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:10.833
So for example, right now,

00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:13.294
if I focus too much on the balls,

00:06:13.318 --> 00:06:16.445
then there's no way I can relax
and talk to you at the same time.

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.573
Equally, if I relax too much
talking to you,

00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:20.503
there's no way I can focus on the balls.

00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:21.709
I'm going to drop them.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:24.351
Now in life, and in meditation,

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:27.771
there'll be times when the focus
becomes a little bit too intense,

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:31.778
and life starts to feel a bit like this.

00:06:31.802 --> 00:06:33.939
It's a very uncomfortable
way to live life,

00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:35.762
when you get this tight and stressed.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:39.560
At other times, we might take our foot off
the gas a little bit too much,

00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:42.156
and things just become a sort
of little bit like this.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.845
Of course in meditation --

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:44.870
(Snores)

00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:46.679
we're going to end up falling asleep.

00:06:46.703 --> 00:06:49.405
So we're looking for a balance,
a focused relaxation

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:52.441
where we can allow thoughts to come and go

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.608
without all the usual involvement.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:58.472
Now, what usually happens
when we're learning to be mindful

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.416
is that we get distracted by a thought.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.212
Let's say this is an anxious thought.

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:05.862
Everything's going fine,
and we see the anxious thought.

00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:08.409
"Oh, I didn't realize
I was worried about that."

00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:09.885
You go back to it, repeat it.

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.072
"Oh, I am worried.

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:13.531
I really am worried.
Wow, there's so much anxiety."

00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:15.315
And before we know it, right,

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.277
we're anxious about feeling anxious.

00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:19.309
(Laughter)

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:20.650
You know, this is crazy.

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.813
We do this all the time,
even on an everyday level.

00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:27.965
If you think about the last time
you had a wobbly tooth.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.075
You know it's wobbly,
and you know that it hurts.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.327
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.878
(Mumbling)

00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:39.071
It does hurt.

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:41.640
And we reinforce the storyline, right?

00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:44.621
And we just keep telling ourselves,
and we do it all the time.

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:47.333
And it's only in learning
to watch the mind in this way

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:51.136
that we can start to let go
of those storylines and patterns of mind.

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.466
But when you sit down
and you watch the mind in this way,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.345
you might see many different patterns.

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:59.002
You might find a mind
that's really restless and --

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:00.201
the whole time.

00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:04.017
Don't be surprised if you feel
a bit agitated in your body

00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:07.327
when you sit down to do nothing
and your mind feels like that.

00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:10.178
You might find a mind that's very dull

00:08:10.202 --> 00:08:12.514
and boring, and it's just,
almost mechanical,

00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:15.717
it just seems it's as if you're
getting up, going to work,

00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:17.540
eat, sleep, get up, work.

00:08:18.222 --> 00:08:20.722
Or it might just be
that one little nagging thought

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:25.097
that just goes round and round your mind.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.242
Well, whatever it is,

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:32.881
meditation offers the opportunity,
the potential to step back

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:35.419
and to get a different perspective,

00:08:35.443 --> 00:08:39.344
to see that things aren't always
as they appear.

00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:46.029
We can't change every little thing
that happens to us in life,

00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:49.460
but we can change
the way that we experience it.

00:08:49.484 --> 00:08:53.197
That's the potential
of meditation, of mindfulness.

00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:55.771
You don't have to burn any incense,

00:08:55.795 --> 00:08:58.176
and you definitely don't have
to sit on the floor.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.089
All you need to do
is to take 10 minutes out a day

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:05.626
to step back, to familiarize yourself
with the present moment

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.312
so that you get to experience
a greater sense

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:12.283
of focus, calm and clarity in your life.

00:09:12.747 --> 00:09:13.945
Thank you very much.

00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:17.969
(Applause)
