00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm a savant,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
or more precisely,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a high-functioning

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
autistic savant.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It's a rare condition.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And rarer still when accompanied,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
as in my case,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
by self-awareness

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and a mastery of language.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Very often when I meet someone

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and they learn this about me,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
there's a certain kind of awkwardness.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I can see it in their eyes.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
They want to ask me something.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And in the end, quite often,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
the urge is stronger than they are

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and they blurt it out:

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
"If I give you my date of birth,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
(Laughter)

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Or they mention cube roots

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
or ask me to recite a long number or long text.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I hope you'll forgive me

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
if I don't perform

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.260
a kind of one-man savant show for you today.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I'm going to talk instead

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
about something

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
far more interesting

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
than dates of birth or cube roots --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
a little deeper

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I want to talk to you briefly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
about perception.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
When he was writing the plays and the short stories

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that would make his name,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Anton Chekhov kept a notebook

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in which he noted down

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
his observations

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
of the world around him --

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
little details

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that other people seem to miss.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Every time I read Chekhov

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and his unique vision of human life,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I'm reminded of why I too

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
became a writer.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
In my books,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I explore the nature of perception

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and how different kinds of perceiving

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
create different kinds of knowing

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and understanding.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Here are three questions

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
drawn from my work.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Rather than try to figure them out,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
the intuitions

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and the gut instincts

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that are going through your head and your heart

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
as you look at them.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
For example, the calculation:

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
can you feel where on the number line

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
the solution is likely to fall?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
can you get a sense of the range of meanings

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
that it's pointing you towards?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And in terms of the line of poetry,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
why does the poet use the word hare

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
rather than rabbit?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I'm asking you to do this

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
are at the heart

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
of how we acquire knowledge.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Aesthetic judgments,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
rather than abstract reasoning,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
guide and shape the process

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
by which we all come to know

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
what we know.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
I'm an extreme example of this.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
My worlds of words and numbers

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
blur with color, emotion

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and personality.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
As Juan said,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
an unusual cross-talk

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
between the senses.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Here are the numbers one to 12

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
as I see them --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.260
every number with its own shape and character.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
One is a flash of white light.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
The sketches are in black and white here,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
but in my mind they have colors.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Three is green.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Four is blue.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Five is yellow.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
I paint as well.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And here is one of my paintings.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Three-dimensional shapes

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and the space they create in the middle

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
creates a new shape,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
the answer to the sum.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
What about bigger numbers?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
the mathematical constant.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
It's an infinite number --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
literally goes on forever.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
In this painting that I made

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.260
of the first 20 decimals of Pi,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I take the colors

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and the emotions and the textures

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and I pull them all together

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.260
into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Words too, for me,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
have colors and emotions

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and textures.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And this is an opening phrase

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
from the novel "Lolita."

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And you can see here

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
how my perception of the sound L

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
helps the alliteration

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
to jump right out.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Another example:

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
a little bit more mathematical.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I wonder if some of you will notice

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
the construction of the sentence

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
from "The Great Gatsby."

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
There is a procession of syllables --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
wheat, one;

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
prairies, two;

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
lost Swede towns, three --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
one, two, three.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and it helps the sentence

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
to feel right.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Let's go back to the questions

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I posed you a moment ago.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
64 multiplied by 75.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
If some of you play chess,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
you'll know that 64

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
is a square number,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and that's why chessboards,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
eight by eight,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
have 64 squares.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So that gives us a form

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that we can picture, that we can perceive.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
What about 75?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Well if 100,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
if we think of 100 as being like a square,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
75 would look like this.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So what we need to do now

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
is put those two pictures

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
together in our mind --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
something like this.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.260
64 becomes 6,400.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And in the right-hand corner,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
you don't have to calculate anything.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Four across, four up and down --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
it's 16.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So what the sum is actually asking you to do

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
is 16,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
16, 16.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
That's a lot easier

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
It's 16, 16, 16, 48,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
4,800 --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
4,800,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
the answer to the sum.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Easy when you know how.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
(Laughter)

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
The second question was an Icelandic word.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I'm assuming there are not many people here

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
who speak Icelandic.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So let me narrow the choices down to two.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Hnugginn:

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
is it a happy word,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
or a sad word?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
What do you say?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Okay.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Some people say it's happy.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Most people, a majority of people,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
say sad.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And it actually means sad.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
(Laughter)

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Why do, statistically,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
a majority of people

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
say that a word is sad, in this case,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
heavy in other cases?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
In my theory, language evolves in such a way

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
that sounds match,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
correspond with, the subjective,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
with the personal,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
intuitive experience

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
of the listener.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Let's have a look at the third question.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
It's a line from a poem by John Keats.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Words, like numbers,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
express fundamental relationships

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
between objects

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and events and forces

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
that constitute our world.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
should in the course of our lives

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
absorb intuitively those relationships.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And poets, like other artists,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
play with those intuitive understandings.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
In the case of hare,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
it's an ambiguous sound in English.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And if we think of that --

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
let me put the picture up --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
the fibers represent vulnerability.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
They yield to the slightest movement

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
or motion or emotion.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
So what you have is an atmosphere

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
of vulnerability and tension.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
The hare itself, the animal --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
not a cat, not a dog, a hare --

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
why a hare?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Because think of the picture --

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
not the word, the picture.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
The overlong ears,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
the overlarge feet,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
what it means to limp

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and to tremble.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So in these few minutes,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
I hope I've been able to share

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
a little bit of my vision of things

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and to show you

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
that words can have colors and emotions,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
numbers, shapes and personalities.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
The world is richer,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
vaster

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
than it too often seems to be.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
I hope that I've given you the desire

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
to learn to see the world with new eyes.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Thank you.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Applause)
