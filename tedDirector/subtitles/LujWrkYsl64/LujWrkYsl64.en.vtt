00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:15.096
The work of a transportation commissioner

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:18.590
isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.764
It involves the design of cities

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:23.160
and the design of city streets.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.131
Streets are some of the most valuable resources

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.909
that a city has, and yet it's an asset

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.765
that's largely hidden in plain sight.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.346
And the lesson from New York

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:35.004
over the past six years

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.300
is that you can update this asset.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.998
You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:43.736
it can provide immediate benefits,

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.337
and it can be quite popular.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:49.829
You just need to look at them a little differently.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.577
This is important because we live in an urban age.

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:55.656
For the first time in history,

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.421
most people live in cities,

00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:01.984
and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.885
the population is going to double on the planet.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:09.328
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:10.913
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this

00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:14.152
when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:16.865
The plan recognized that cities

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:18.987
are in a global marketplace,

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:21.712
and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:25.015
and to attract the million more people

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.615
that are expected to move here,

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.866
we need to focus on the quality of life

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:33.534
and the efficiency of our infrastructure.

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:35.177
For many cities, our streets have been

00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:39.286
in a kind of suspended animation for generations.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:42.862
This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,

00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:46.841
and despite all of the technological innovation,

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.290
cultural changes, political changes,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.545
this is Times Square in 2008.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:55.918
Not much has changed in those 50 years.

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:58.981
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.596
to maximize efficient mobility,

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:05.177
providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,

00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:08.236
more room for people to enjoy the city,

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:10.471
and to make our streets as safe as they can be

00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:13.579
for everybody that uses them.

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.067
We set out a clear action plan

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:18.763
with goals and benchmarks.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.981
Having goals is important,

00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:25.102
because if you want to change and steer the ship

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:27.725
of a big city in a new direction,

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:31.921
you need to know where you're going and why.

00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:34.174
The design of a street can tell you everything

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.523
about what's expected on it.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:40.524
In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:42.461
The design of this street is really

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.121
to maximize the movement of cars

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.849
moving as quickly as possible

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.672
from point A to point B,

00:02:48.672 --> 00:02:50.564
and it misses all the other ways

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.991
that a street is used.

00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:55.942
When we started out, we did some early surveys

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.987
about how our streets were used,

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.983
and we found that New York City was largely

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:02.114
a city without seats.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.498
Pictures like this, people perched

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:08.671
on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:10.959
(Laughter)

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.435
It's not great for parents with kids.

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.671
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.

00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:19.712
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.

00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:22.764
Certainly not good for the police department.

00:03:22.764 --> 00:03:25.773
So we worked hard to change that balance,

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:29.108
and probably the best example of our new approach

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.743
is in Times Square.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:34.573
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day

00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:36.283
walk through Times Square,

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.773
and people had tried for years to make changes.

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:41.161
They changed signals, they changed lanes,

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:44.064
everything they could do to make Times Square work better.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.986
It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:48.707
It was chaotic.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.489
And so, none of those approaches worked,

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.538
so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,

00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:55.207
looked at our street differently.

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:58.780
And so we did a six-month pilot.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.036
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:05.570
and created two and a half acres

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.346
of new pedestrian space.

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:11.513
And the temporary materials are an important part

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:14.938
of the program, because we were able to show

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:16.307
how it worked.

00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:19.286
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:21.122
So it was all about the data.

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:24.295
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.648
if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:29.379
and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.269
we could put it back the way that it was,

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:32.530
because these were temporary materials.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.439
And that was a very big part of the buy-in,

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.582
much less anxiety when you think that something

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:39.453
can be put back.

00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:41.607
But the results were overwhelming.

00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:44.527
Traffic moved better. It was much safer.

00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:46.934
Five new flagship stores opened.

00:04:46.934 --> 00:04:48.807
It's been a total home run.

00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:51.390
Times Square is now one of the top 10

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.021
retail locations on the planet.

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:56.455
And this is an important lesson,

00:04:56.455 --> 00:04:59.553
because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game

00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:04.078
between moving traffic and creating public space.

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:06.893
Every project has its surprises,

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:09.546
and one of the big surprises with Times Square

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:13.226
was how quickly people flocked to the space.

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:15.284
We put out the orange barrels,

00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:18.892
and people just materialized immediately into the street.

00:05:18.892 --> 00:05:20.933
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.262
They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!

00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:24.640
All the people arrived.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.398
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.

00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:30.542
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:34.058
because the street furniture had not yet arrived.

00:05:34.058 --> 00:05:36.680
So we went to a hardware store

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.027
and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:42.219
and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.115
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:48.999
It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.358
It was about those lawn chairs.

00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:51.874
"What did you think about the lawn chairs?"

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.566
"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"

00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:57.332
So if you've got a big, controversial project,

00:05:57.332 --> 00:05:59.043
think about lawn chairs.

00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:01.953
(Laughter)

00:06:01.953 --> 00:06:04.450
This is the final design for Times Square,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.990
and it will create a level surface,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.674
sidewalk to sidewalk,

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:10.902
beautiful pavers that have studs in them

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:12.940
to reflect the light from the billboards,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.653
creating a great new energy on the street,

00:06:15.653 --> 00:06:17.770
and we think it's going to really create

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.928
a great place, a new crossroads of the world

00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:21.451
that is worthy of its name.

00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:22.952
And we will be cutting the ribbon on this,

00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:26.554
the first phase, this December.

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:29.011
With all of our projects, our public space projects,

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:31.224
we work closely with local businesses

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.755
and local merchant groups

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:36.071
who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,

00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:37.492
take care of the plants.

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:39.511
This is in front of Macy's, and they were

00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:41.625
a big supporter of this new approach,

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:46.472
because they understood that more people on foot

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.453
is better for business.

00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:51.123
And we've done these projects all across the city

00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:52.735
in all kinds of neighborhoods.

00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:54.861
This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,

00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.953
and you can see the short leg that was there,

00:06:56.953 --> 00:06:59.203
used for cars, that's not really needed.

00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:02.792
So what we did is we painted over the street,

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:06.123
put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.118
to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,

00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:10.116
created a great new public space,

00:07:10.116 --> 00:07:12.130
and it's been great for businesses

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.713
along Grand Avenue.

00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:16.869
We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:19.297
and this is one of our first projects that we did,

00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:21.892
and we took an underutilized,

00:07:21.892 --> 00:07:24.573
pretty dingy-looking parking lot

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:27.825
and used some paint and planters

00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:30.711
to transform it over a weekend.

00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.669
And in the three years since we've implemented the project,

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.423
retail sales have increased 172 percent.

00:07:38.423 --> 00:07:43.295
And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.444
We've moved very, very quickly

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:47.693
with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:48.950
Instead of waiting

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.773
through years of planning studies

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.151
and computer models to get something done,

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:56.886
we've done it with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:59.236
And the proof is not in a computer model.

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:02.201
It is in the real-world performance of the street.

00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.197
You can have fun with paint.

00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:09.430
All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.205
in all five boroughs across the city.

00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:17.011
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes

00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:21.007
and turned them into new pedestrian space.

00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:24.448
I think one of the successes is in its emulation.

00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:25.989
You're seeing this kind of approach,

00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:27.544
since we've painted Times Square,

00:08:27.544 --> 00:08:30.574
you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,

00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:33.073
in San Francisco, in Mexico City,

00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:34.636
Buenos Aires, you name it.

00:08:34.636 --> 00:08:36.985
This is actually in Los Angeles,

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:40.608
and they actually copied even the green dots

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.633
that we had on the streets.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:44.743
But I can't underscore enough

00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:47.320
how much more quickly this enables you to move

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.442
over traditional construction methods.

00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:52.602
We also brought this quick-acting approach

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:54.150
to our cycling program,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.666
and in six years turned cycling

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:59.905
into a real transportation option in New York.

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:01.602
I think it's fair to say --

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:06.841
(Applause) --

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.305
it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:11.863
and now New York has become

00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:15.908
one of the cycling capitals in the United States.

00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:19.904
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:22.339
network of lanes.

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:24.700
You can see the map in 2007.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.894
This is how it looked in 2013

00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:31.490
after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.507
I love this because it looks so easy.

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:37.406
You just click it, and they're there.

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:40.417
We also brought new designs to the street.

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:43.754
We created the first parking-protected bike lane

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:45.326
in the United States.

00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:46.853
(Applause)

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:50.124
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:51.637
and it's been great.

00:09:51.637 --> 00:09:53.364
Bike volumes have spiked.

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:55.998
Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,

00:09:55.998 --> 00:09:57.789
are all down 50 percent.

00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:01.052
And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,

00:10:01.052 --> 00:10:02.591
and now you're seeing them pop up

00:10:02.591 --> 00:10:04.460
all over the country.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.317
And you can see here that this strategy has worked.

00:10:07.317 --> 00:10:08.969
The blue line is the number of cyclists,

00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:09.973
soaring.

00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:11.916
The green line is the number of bike lanes.

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:14.412
And the yellow line is the number of injuries,

00:10:14.412 --> 00:10:16.897
which has remained essentially flat.

00:10:16.897 --> 00:10:19.765
After this big expansion, you've seen

00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:21.615
no net increase in injuries,

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:24.271
and so there is something to that axiom

00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:27.518
that there is safety in numbers.

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.650
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.922
and there was a lawsuit and somewhat

00:10:32.922 --> 00:10:35.894
of a media frenzy a couple years ago.

00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:38.141
One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane

00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:40.595
that we have on Prospect Park West

00:10:40.595 --> 00:10:42.483
"the most contested piece of land

00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:44.455
outside of the Gaza Strip."

00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:47.834
(Laughter)

00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:49.754
And this is what we had done.

00:10:49.754 --> 00:10:54.760
So if you dig below the headlines, though,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.653
you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,

00:10:57.653 --> 00:10:59.901
far ahead of the politicians.

00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.089
In fact, I think most politicians would be happy

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:04.240
to have those kind of poll numbers.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.318
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:09.297
This summer, we launched Citi Bike,

00:11:09.297 --> 00:11:11.880
the largest bike share program in the United States,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.764
with 6,000 bikes

00:11:13.764 --> 00:11:17.326
and 330 stations located next to one another.

00:11:17.326 --> 00:11:19.334
Since we've launched the program,

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:21.002
three million trips have been taken.

00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:23.771
People have ridden seven million miles.

00:11:23.771 --> 00:11:26.633
That's 280 times around the globe.

00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:28.704
And so with this little blue key,

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:31.337
you can unlock the keys to the city

00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:33.893
and this brand new transportation option.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.252
And daily usage just continues to soar.

00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.997
What has happened is the average daily ridership

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.703
on the streets of New York is 36,000 people.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:44.735
The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.

00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:48.624
Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.586
The bikes are being used six times a day.

00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:53.367
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:54.722
that are on the streets.

00:11:54.722 --> 00:11:57.096
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,

00:11:57.096 --> 00:12:00.101
ninja-clad bike messenger.

00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:03.938
And today, cyclists look

00:12:03.938 --> 00:12:06.109
like New York City looks.

00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:09.291
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:12.309
women, kids, all getting on a bike.

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:15.326
It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.

00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:17.416
Quite radical.

00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:20.558
We've also brought this approach to our buses,

00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:23.995
and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:25.436
the slowest bus speeds.

00:12:25.436 --> 00:12:26.515
As everybody knows,

00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:28.917
you can walk across town faster

00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:30.137
than you can take the bus.

00:12:30.137 --> 00:12:32.939
And so we focused on the most congested areas

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:34.364
of New York City,

00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:37.295
built out six bus rapid transit lines,

00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:40.588
57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.

00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:43.318
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.

00:12:43.318 --> 00:12:45.704
We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out

00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:47.830
because they get ticketed by a camera

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.343
if they use that lane,

00:12:49.343 --> 00:12:52.985
and it's been a huge success.

00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:55.025
I think one of my very favorite moments

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.311
as transportation commissioner was the day

00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.808
that we launched Citi Bike,

00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:01.858
and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.218
in my protected bike lane,

00:13:03.218 --> 00:13:05.594
and I looked over and I saw pedestrians

00:13:05.594 --> 00:13:08.222
standing safely on the pedestrian islands,

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.586
and the traffic was flowing,

00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:12.536
birds were singing --

00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:13.891
(Laughter) --

00:13:13.891 --> 00:13:16.977
the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:20.675
It was just fantastic.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.546
And this is how it looked six years ago.

00:13:23.546 --> 00:13:26.990
And so, I think that the lesson that we have

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.469
from New York is that it's possible

00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:33.177
to change your streets quickly,

00:13:33.177 --> 00:13:37.171
it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,

00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:39.525
and it can be quite popular.

00:13:39.525 --> 00:13:42.804
You just need to reimagine your streets.

00:13:42.804 --> 00:13:44.869
They're hidden in plain sight.

00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:46.267
Thank you.

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:50.960
(Applause)
