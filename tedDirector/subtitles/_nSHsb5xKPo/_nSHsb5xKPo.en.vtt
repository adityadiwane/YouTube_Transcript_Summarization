00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.936
In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.896
boarded a flight from Minneapolis

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.216
to the Horn of Africa.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.656
And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.336
he was not alone.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.736
Al-Shabaab managed to recruit
over two dozen young men

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.336
in their late teens and early 20s

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.376
with a heavy presence
on social media platforms like Facebook.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.656
With the Internet and other technologies,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.376
they've changed our everyday lives,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.216
but they've also changed
recruitment, radicalization

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.960
and the front lines of conflict today.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.136
What about the links connecting Twitter,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.096
Google and protesters
fighting for democracy?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.136
These numbers represent
Google's public DNS servers,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.696
effectively the only
digital border crossing

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.776
protesters had and could use

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.616
to communicate with each other,
to reach the outside world

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.256
and to spread viral awareness

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.560
of what was happening
in their own country.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.376
Today, conflict is essentially borderless.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.056
If there are bounds to conflict today,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.976
they're bound by digital,
not physical geography.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.056
And under all this is a vacuum of power

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.136
where non-state actors, individuals
and private organizations

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.400
have the advantage over slow, outdated
military and intelligence agencies.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.016
And this is because,
in the digital age of conflict,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.296
there exists a feedback loop

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.176
where new technologies,
platforms like the ones I mentioned,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.656
and more disruptive ones,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.456
can be adapted, learned, and deployed
by individuals and organizations

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.000
faster than governments can react.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.936
To understand the pace
of our own government thinking on this,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.936
I like to turn to something aptly named

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.096
the Worldwide Threat Assessment,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.816
where every year the Director
of National Intelligence in the US

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.656
looks at the global threat landscape,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.936
and he says, "These are the threats,
these are the details,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.016
and this is how we rank them."

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.456
In 2007, there was absolutely
no mention of cyber security.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.175
It took until 2011,
when it came at the end,

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.096
where other things, like West
African drug trafficking, took precedence.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.616
In 2012, it crept up, still behind things
like terrorism and proliferation.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.736
In 2013, it became the top threat,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.240
in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.896
What things like that show us

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.896
is that there is
a fundamental inability today

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.560
on the part of governments
to adapt and learn in digital conflict,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.680
where conflict can be immaterial,
borderless, often wholly untraceable.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.176
And conflict isn't just online to offline,
as we see with terrorist radicalization,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.280
but it goes the other way as well.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.056
We all know the horrible events
that unfolded in Paris this year

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.033
with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:09.536
What an individual hacker or a small group
of anonymous individuals did

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.176
was enter those social media conversations
that so many of us took part in.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.336
#JeSuisCharlie.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.576
On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.056
all sorts of places where millions
of people, myself included,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.696
were talking about the events

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.176
and saw images like this,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.336
the emotional, poignant image of a baby
with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.456
And this turned into a weapon.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.816
What the hackers did
was weaponize this image,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.496
where unsuspecting victims,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.416
like all of us in those conversations,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.056
saw this image, downloaded it

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.216
but it was embedded with malware.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.216
And so when you downloaded this image,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.296
it hacked your system.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.360
It took six days to deploy
a global malware campaign.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.136
The divide between physical
and digital domains today

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.576
ceases to exist,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.536
where we have offline attacks
like those in Paris

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.800
appropriated for online hacks.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.776
And it goes the other way as well,
with recruitment.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.256
We see online radicalization of teens,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.560
who can then be deployed globally
for offline terrorist attacks.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.336
With all of this, we see that there's
a new 21st century battle brewing,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.520
and governments
don't necessarily take a part.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.896
So in another case,
Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.456
In early September 2011 in Mexico,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.536
Los Zetas, one of the most
powerful drug cartels,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.896
hung two bloggers with a sign that said,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.600
"This is what will happen
to all Internet busybodies."

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.696
A week later, they beheaded a young girl.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.176
They severed her head,
put it on top of her computer

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.416
with a similar note.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.296
And taking the digital counteroffensive

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.606
because governments couldn't even
understand what was going on or act,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.526
Anonymous, a group we might not associate
as the most positive force in the world,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.736
took action,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.360
not in cyber attacks, but threatening
information to be free.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.616
On social media, they said,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.296
"We will release information

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.640
that ties prosecutors and governors
to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.176
And escalating that conflict,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.000
Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people
for every bit of information you release."

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.520
And so it ended there because
it would become too gruesome to continue.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.600
But what was powerful about this

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.216
was that anonymous individuals,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.856
not federal policia,
not military, not politicians,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.056
could strike fear deep into the heart

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.480
of one of the most powerful,
violent organizations in the world.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.496
And so we live in an era

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.056
that lacks the clarity
of the past in conflict,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.896
in who we're fighting,
in the motivations behind attacks,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.776
in the tools and techniques used,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.440
and how quickly they evolve.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.216
And the question still remains:

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.776
what can individuals,
organizations and governments do?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.616
For answers to these questions,
it starts with individuals,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.400
and I think peer-to-peer security
is the answer.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.736
Those people in relationships
that bought over teens online,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.816
we can do that with peer-to-peer security.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.376
Individuals have more power
than ever before

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.320
to affect national
and international security.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.616
And we can create those positive
peer-to-peer relationships

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.840
on and offline,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.056
we can support and educate the next
generation of hackers, like myself,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.640
instead of saying, "You can either be
a criminal or join the NSA."

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.720
That matters today.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.136
And it's not just individuals --
it's organizations, corporations even.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.696
They have an advantage
to act across more borders,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.256
more effectively and more rapidly
than governments can,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.160
and there's a set
of real incentives there.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.136
It's profitable and valuable

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.656
to be seen as trustworthy
in the digital age,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.656
and will only be more so
in future generations to come.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.496
But we still can't ignore government,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.856
because that's who we turn to
for collective action

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.640
to keep us safe and secure.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.096
But we see where that's gotten us so far,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.856
where there's an inability to adapt
and learn in digital conflict,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.936
where at the highest levels of leadership,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.336
the Director of the CIA,
Secretary of Defense,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.800
they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen."
"Cyber 9/11 is imminent."

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.080
But this only makes us
more fearful, not more secure.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.936
By banning encryption in favor
of mass surveillance and mass hacking,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.680
sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.595
But that doesn't mean
that they're the only ones that can.

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.776
Capabilities are cheap, even free.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.416
Technical ability
is rising around the world,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.960
and individuals and small groups
have the advantage.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.456
So today it might just be
the NSA and GCHQ,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.242
but who's to say that the Chinese
can't find that backdoor?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.240
Or in another generation,
some kid in his basement in Estonia?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.656
And so I would say that it's
not what governments can do,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.960
it's that they can't.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.216
Governments today
need to give up power and control

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.520
in order to help make us more secure.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.696
Giving up mass surveillance and hacking
and instead fixing those backdoors

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.976
means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.336
but neither can the Chinese

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.720
or that hacker in Estonia
a generation from now.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.736
And government support
for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.336
mean giving up control,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.655
but it means that developers, translators,
anybody with an Internet connection,

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:50.775
in countries like Cuba, Iran and China,
can sell their skills, their products,

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.176
in the global marketplace,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.416
but more importantly sell their ideas,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.120
show us what's happening
in their own countries.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.376
And so it should be not fearful,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.816
it should be inspiring
to the same governments

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.696
that fought for civil rights,
free speech and democracy

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.736
in the great wars of the last century,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.816
that today, for the first time
in human history,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.056
we have a technical opportunity

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.696
to make billions of people
safer around the world

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.256
that we've never had before
in human history.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.360
It should be inspiring.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.240
(Applause)
