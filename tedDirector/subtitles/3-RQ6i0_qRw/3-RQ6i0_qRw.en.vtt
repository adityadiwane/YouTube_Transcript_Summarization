00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've actually been waiting by the phone

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for a call from TED for years.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In 2004, I started Participant Productions

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we had a really good first year, and no call.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And finally, I get a call last year,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laughter)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I had some misgivings.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Laughter)

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Hollywood gathers around power tables,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and the Valley gathers around power tables.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So it turned out there was a lot more in common

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
than I would have dreamed.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and they want to know what drives you a bit.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And what really drives me is a vision of the future

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that I think we all share.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And when we heard a lot of the presentations

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
over the last couple of days,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think we all realized how far we have to go

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to get to this new version of humanity

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And it's also something that resides in each of us,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to close what I think

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
are the two big calamities in the world today.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
One is the gap in opportunity --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this gap that President Clinton last night

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and all these evils that we see around us.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And I think that's just a horrible thing.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
because within each of us is the power to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And if the men and women of TED

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so I used to read authors like James Michener

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And their stories made the world seem a very small

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and interconnected place.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And it struck me that if I could write stories

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that were about this world as being small and interconnected,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that maybe I could get people interested in the issues

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And my dad came home one day

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that one never knows how much time one really has.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I started a couple of businesses

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
One of those businesses was a computer rental business

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
called Micros on the Move,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which is very well named,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because people kept stealing the computers.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Laughter)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
for this. This is a photo from the old days.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
with this idea to help people

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
buy and sell things online with each other.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Laughter)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And needless to say, I was right.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The company went public two years later

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and is today one of the best known companies in the world.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But for me, personally, it was a real change.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and living off their leftovers,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And I wanted to figure out how I could

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And around that time, I met John Gardner,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
who is a remarkable man.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He was the architect of the Great Society programs

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
or anyone could do, to make a difference

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
in the long-term issues facing humanity.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Bet on good people doing good things."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that really resonated with me.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I started a foundation

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to bet on these good people doing good things.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
who are using business skills in a very leveraged way

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to solve social problems.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
People today we call social entrepreneurs.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
who started the Grameen Bank,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
won the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
because she felt girls' education was lagging.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And she started it about 10 years ago,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
also known as black fever.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
which is really a scourge in the developing world.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And so this is one way to bet

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
on good people doing good things.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that I find really is powerful.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
or in business. Invest in these folks.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Connecting them together through conferences --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that my foundation does at Oxford every year.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And celebrate them: tell their stories,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
because not only are there good people doing good work,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in the issues that affect us all.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And a light bulb went off,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And I thought about the films that inspired me,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And there really wasn't a specific company

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that was focused on the public interest.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
One of the lines of encouragement

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that I heard over and over was,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And then of course, there was the other adage.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
"The surest way to become a millionaire

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
(Laughter)

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
with the vision to be a global media company

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
focused on the public interest.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And our mission is to produce entertainment

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that creates and inspires social change.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And we don't just want people to see our movies

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and "Good Night and Good Luck."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Perhaps more importantly,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and the activism programs

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that we created to go around the movies.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And we had an online component of that,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
our community sect called Participate.net.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
there was actually something they could do to make a difference.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
kind of a box office disaster.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
domestic violence and so on.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And we released the film at the same time that

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and with our social sector partners,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
like the National Organization of Women,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the film was widely credited

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
with influencing the successful renewal of the act.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the film started about a true-life story

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and the Violence Against Women Act and others.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then the movie about this person doing these things,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
then led to this greater renewal.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And so again,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I first saw Al do his slide show presentation

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
on global warming in May of 2005.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And after we saw his slide show,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it became clear that it was much more urgent.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and Davis Guggenheim,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
because we felt that we could get the message out there

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that nobody knows nothing about anything.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And I really thought this was going to be

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And so it was a great shock to all of us

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
when the film really captured the public interest,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and most of Scandinavia.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
(Laughter)

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And for Participant, this is just the start.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And we have 10 films in production right now,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and dozens others in development.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And we think once people see these films,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and the Middle East in general.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Abby Hoffman and crew,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
who did make change in the world.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Laughter)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to make change in their own way.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And all the people in this room

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
have done so through their business lives,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And one thing that I've learned

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is that there's never one right way to make change.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but every one of us is all of those things and more.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And I believe if we do these things,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And I can imagine, if we do this,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
(Applause)

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Applause)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
(Laughter)

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And I believe that, working together,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
we can make all of these things happen.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
It's been a real honor. Thank you.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
(Applause)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Oh, thank you.
