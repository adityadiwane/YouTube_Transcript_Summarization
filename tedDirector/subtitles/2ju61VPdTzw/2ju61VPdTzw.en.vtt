00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:15.094
One summer afternoon in 2013,

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:18.246
DC police detained, questioned
and searched a man

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.362
who appeared suspicious
and potentially dangerous.

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:25.581
This wasn't what I was wearing
the day of the detention, to be fair,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.428
but I have a picture of that as well.

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:30.148
I know it's very frightening --
try to remain calm.

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:31.265
(Laughter)

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.711
At this time, I was interning

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.467
at the Public Defender Service
in Washington DC,

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:38.910
and I was visiting
a police station for work.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.094
I was on my way out,

00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:42.110
and before I could make it to my car,

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:44.435
two police cars pulled up
to block my exit,

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.790
and an officer approached me from behind.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.086
He told me to stop, take my backpack off

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.186
and put my hands on the police car
parked next to us.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.615
About a dozen officers
then gathered near us.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:56.886
All of them had handguns,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.250
some had assault rifles.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.008
They rifled through my backpack.

00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:01.437
They patted me down.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.822
They took pictures of me
spread on the police car,

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:05.002
and they laughed.

00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:06.566
And as all this was happening --

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.840
as I was on the police car trying
to ignore the shaking in my legs,

00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:12.199
trying to think clearly
about what I should do --

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.222
something stuck out to me as odd.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:16.240
When I look at myself in this photo,

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:18.099
if I were to describe myself,

00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:19.910
I think I'd say something like,

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:25.323
"19-year-old Indian male,
bright T-shirt, wearing glasses."

00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:27.628
But they weren't including
any of these details.

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:29.902
Into their police radios
as they described me,

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:32.558
they kept saying, "Middle Eastern
male with a backpack.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.611
Middle Eastern male with a backpack."

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:37.708
And this description carried on
into their police reports.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.845
I never expected to be described
by my own government in these terms:

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.127
"lurking,"

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.352
"nefarious,"

00:01:47.652 --> 00:01:48.812
"terrorist."

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:50.779
And the detention dragged on like this.

00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:54.681
They sent dogs trained to smell explosives
to sweep the area I'd been in.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:58.132
They called the federal government
to see if I was on any watch lists.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:01.007
They sent a couple of detectives
to cross-examine me on why,

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:03.147
if I claimed I had nothing to hide,

00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:05.217
I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.302
And I could see
they weren't happy with me,

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.409
but I felt I had no way of knowing
what they'd want to do next.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.330
At one point, the officer
who patted me down

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:16.884
scanned the side of the police station
to see where the security camera was

00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:19.780
to see how much of this
was being recorded.

00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:20.972
And when he did that,

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:24.466
it really sank in how completely
I was at their mercy.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.913
I think we're all normalized
from a young age

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:30.690
to the idea of police officers
and arrests and handcuffs,

00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:34.656
so it's easy to forget how demeaning
and coercive a thing it is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.585
to seize control over
another person's body.

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.654
I know it sounds like
the point of my story

00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:42.120
is how badly treated I was
because of my race --

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:45.264
and yes, I don't think I would've been
detained if I were white.

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.027
But actually, what I have in mind
today is something else.

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:50.769
What I have in mind is how
much worse things might've been

00:02:50.793 --> 00:02:51.957
if I weren't affluent.

00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:54.899
I mean, they thought I might be trying
to plant an explosive,

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:58.092
and they investigated that possibility
for an hour and a half,

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.828
but I was never put in handcuffs,

00:02:59.852 --> 00:03:01.864
I was never taken to a jail cell.

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:05.948
I think if I were from one of Washington
DC's poor communities of color,

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:08.395
and they thought I was
endangering officers' lives,

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.040
things might've ended differently.

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.468
And in fact, in our system, I think
it's better to be an affluent person

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:15.780
suspected of trying
to blow up a police station

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:17.471
than it is to be a poor person

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.152
who's suspected of much,
much less than this.

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.751
I want to give you an example
from my current work.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.379
Right now, I'm working
at a civil rights organization in DC,

00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:28.735
called Equal Justice Under Law.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.668
Let me start by asking you all a question.

00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:34.679
How many of you have ever gotten
a parking ticket in your life?

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:35.867
Raise your hand.

00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:37.837
Yeah. So have I.

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.194
And when I had to pay it,

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.249
it felt annoying and it felt bad,

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:43.189
but I paid it and I moved on.

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.904
I'm guessing most of you
have paid your tickets as well.

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:50.723
But what would happen if you
couldn't afford the amount on the ticket

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.917
and your family doesn't have
the money either, what happens then?

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:56.932
Well, one thing that's not supposed
to happen under the law is,

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:59.060
you're not supposed to be
arrested and jailed

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:01.180
simply because you can't afford to pay.

00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:03.008
That's illegal under federal law.

00:04:03.032 --> 00:04:05.960
But that's what local governments
across the country are doing

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:07.141
to people who are poor.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.085
And so many of our lawsuits
at Equal Justice Under Law

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.562
target these modern-day debtors' prisons.

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.312
One of our cases is against
Ferguson, Missouri.

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:18.160
And I know when I say Ferguson,

00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:20.282
many of you will think of police violence.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.593
But today I want to talk
about a different aspect

00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:26.083
of the relationship between
their police force and their citizens.

00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:29.641
Ferguson was issuing an average
of over two arrest warrants,

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.672
per person, per year,

00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:33.944
mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.839
When I imagine what that would feel like
if, every time I left my house,

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:41.963
there was a chance a police officer
would run my license plate,

00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:43.678
see a warrant for unpaid debt,

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:45.832
seize my body they way the did in DC

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:47.773
and then take me to a jail cell,

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:49.431
I feel a little sick.

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:53.814
I've met many of the people in Ferguson
who have experienced this,

00:04:53.838 --> 00:04:55.625
and I've heard some of their stories.

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.017
In Ferguson's jail,

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:00.150
in each small cell,
there's a bunk bed and a toilet,

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.476
but they'd pack four people
into each cell.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.615
So there'd be two people on the bunks
and two people on the floor,

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.566
one with nowhere to go except
right next to the filthy toilet,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.750
which was never cleaned.

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:11.937
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:15.516
so the floor and the walls were lined
with blood and mucus.

00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:17.058
No water to drink,

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.786
except coming out of a spigot
connected to the toilet.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.530
The water looked and tasted dirty,

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.069
there was never enough food,

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:24.641
never any showers,

00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:27.455
women menstruating
without any hygiene products,

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.173
no medical attention whatsoever.

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.377
When I asked a woman
about medical attention,

00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:33.796
she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.965
The only attention you get
from the guards in there is sexual."

00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:40.378
So, they'd take the debtors
to this place and they'd say,

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.938
"We're not letting you leave
until you make a payment on your debt."

00:05:43.962 --> 00:05:46.592
And if you could -- if you
could call a family member

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.757
who could somehow come up with some money,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.174
then maybe you were out.

00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:52.357
If it was enough money, you were out.

00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:55.699
But if it wasn't, you'd stay there
for days or weeks,

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:58.509
and every day the guards
would come down to the cells

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:01.920
and haggle with the debtors
about the price of release that day.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.567
You'd stay until, at some point,
the jail would be booked to capacity,

00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.541
and they'd want to book someone new in.

00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:10.126
And at that point, they'd think,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.905
"OK, it's unlikely this person
can come up with the money,

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:14.789
it's more likely this new person will."

00:06:14.813 --> 00:06:17.791
You're out, they're in,
and the machine kept moving like that.

00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:19.841
I met a man who,

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:24.132
nine years ago, was arrested
for panhandling in a Walgreens.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:28.212
He couldn't afford his fines
and his court fees from that case.

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:31.232
When he was young
he survived a house fire,

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:34.229
only because he jumped out
of the third-story window to escape.

00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:36.454
But that fall left him
with damage to his brain

00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:38.913
and several parts of this body,
including his leg.

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:40.096
So he can't work,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.622
and he relies on social security
payments to survive.

00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:44.332
When I met him in his apartment,

00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:47.235
he had nothing of value there --
not even food in his fridge.

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:48.424
He's chronically hungry.

00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:51.927
He had nothing of value in his apartment
except a small piece of cardboard

00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.189
on which he'd written
the names of his children.

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.781
He cherished this a lot.
He was happy to show it to me.

00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.961
But he can't pay his fines and fees
because he has nothing to give.

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:03.361
In the last nine years,
he's been arrested 13 times,

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:07.716
and jailed for a total of 130 days
on that panhandling case.

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.527
One of those stretches lasted 45 days.

00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:15.957
Just imagine spending from right now
until sometime in June

00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:18.777
in the place that I described to you
a few moments ago.

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:24.517
He told me about all the suicide attempts
he's seen in Ferguson's jail;

00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:26.814
about the time a man found
a way to hang himself

00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:28.498
out of reach of the other inmates,

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.684
so all they could do
was yell and yell and yell,

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.448
trying to get the guards' attention

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:35.465
so they could come down and cut him down.

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:38.925
And he told me that it took the guards
over five minutes to respond,

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:41.217
and when they came,
the man was unconscious.

00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:44.412
So they called the paramedics
and the paramedics went to the cell.

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:45.768
They said, "He'll be OK,"

00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:47.996
so they just left him there on the floor.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.314
I heard many stories like this
and they shouldn't have surprised me,

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:54.890
because suicide is the single leading
cause of death in our local jails.

00:07:55.672 --> 00:07:58.659
This is related to the lack
of mental health care in our jails.

00:07:58.683 --> 00:08:02.603
I met a woman, single mother of three,
making seven dollars an hour.

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.419
She relies on food stamps
to feed herself and her children.

00:08:05.928 --> 00:08:07.472
About a decade ago,

00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:11.261
she got a couple of traffic tickets
and a minor theft charge,

00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:14.053
and she can't afford her fines
and fees on those cases.

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:18.046
Since then, she's been jailed
about 10 times on those cases,

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.353
but she has schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder,

00:08:20.377 --> 00:08:22.528
and she needs medication every day.

00:08:22.552 --> 00:08:25.590
She doesn't have access
to those medications in Ferguson's jail,

00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:27.830
because no one has access
to their medications.

00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:31.880
She told me about what it was like
to spend two weeks in a cage,

00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:35.457
hallucinating people and shadows
and hearing voices,

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.075
begging for the medication
that would make it all stop,

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.469
only to be ignored.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.036
And this isn't anomalous, either:

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.585
thirty percent of women in our local jails
have serious mental health needs

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:46.765
just like hers,

00:08:46.789 --> 00:08:51.306
but only one in six receives
any mental health care while in jail.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.155
And so, I heard all these stories
about this grotesque dungeon

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:57.377
that Ferguson was operating
for its debtors,

00:08:57.401 --> 00:08:59.694
and when it came time
for me to actually see it

00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:01.672
and to go visit Ferguson's jail,

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:03.736
I'm not sure what I was expecting to see,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.714
but I wasn't expecting this.

00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:08.154
It's an ordinary government building.

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:10.634
It could be a post office or a school.

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:14.350
It reminded me that these illegal
extortion schemes

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:16.462
aren't being run somewhere in the shadows,

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:19.202
they're being run out in the open
by our public officials.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.926
They're a matter of public policy.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.789
And this reminded me
that poverty jailing in general,

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.021
even outside the debtors' prison context,

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:28.966
plays a very visible and central role
in our justice system.

00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:31.850
What I have in mind is our policy of bail.

00:09:31.874 --> 00:09:34.426
In our system, whether
you're detained or free,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.580
pending trial is not a matter
of how dangerous you are

00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:39.852
or how much of a flight risk you pose.

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:42.962
It's a matter of whether you can afford
to post your bail amount.

00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:45.698
So Bill Cosby, whose bail
was set at a million dollars,

00:09:45.722 --> 00:09:49.182
immediately writes the check,
and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.

00:09:49.206 --> 00:09:50.938
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,

00:09:50.962 --> 00:09:54.960
was only there because her family
was unable to come up with 500 dollars.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:58.371
In fact, there are half a million
Sandra Blands across the country --

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:00.661
500,000 people who are in jail right now,

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:03.346
only because they can't afford
their bail amount.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.427
We're told that our jails
are places for criminals,

00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.464
but statistically that's not the case:

00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:12.789
three out of every five people
in jail right now are there pretrial.

00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:14.995
They haven't been convicted of any crime;

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:17.530
they haven't pled guilty to any offense.

00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:19.515
Right here in San Francisco,

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.929
85 percent of the inmates
in our jail in San Francisco

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:24.697
are pretrial detainees.

00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:28.106
This means San Francisco is spending
something like 80 million dollars

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.300
every year

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:31.040
to fund pretrial detention.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.479
Many of these people who are in jail
only because they can't post bail

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:39.749
are facing allegations so minor

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:43.156
that the amount of time it would take
for them to sit waiting for trial

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.232
is longer than the sentence
they would receive if convicted,

00:10:46.256 --> 00:10:48.524
which means they're guaranteed
to get out faster

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:49.832
if they just plead guilty.

00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:51.415
So now the choice is:

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:54.312
Should I stay here in this horrible place,

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:56.446
away from my family and my dependents,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.947
almost guaranteed to lose my job,

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:00.592
and then fight the charges?

00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:04.185
Or should I just plead guilty to whatever
the prosecutor wants and get out?

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:07.144
And at this point, they're pretrial
detainees, not criminals.

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:10.060
But once they take that plea deal,
we'll call them criminals,

00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:13.464
even though an affluent person
would never have been in this situation,

00:11:13.488 --> 00:11:16.362
because an affluent person
would have simply been bailed out.

00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:18.476
At this point you might be wondering,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.294
"This guy's in the inspiration section,
what is he doing --

00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:22.478
(Laughter)

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:25.308
"This is extremely depressing.
I want my money back."

00:11:25.332 --> 00:11:26.538
(Laughter)

00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:28.961
But in actuality,

00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:33.375
I find talking about jailing much less
depressing than the alternative,

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:35.835
because I think if we don't talk
about these issues

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:38.260
and collectively change
how we think about jailing,

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:39.788
at the end of all of our lives,

00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:42.943
we'll still have jails full of poor people
who don't belong there.

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:44.521
That really is depressing to me.

00:11:44.545 --> 00:11:47.969
But what's exciting to me is the thought
that these stories can move us

00:11:47.993 --> 00:11:50.036
to think about jailing in different terms.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.431
Not in sterile policy terms
like "mass incarceration,"

00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:55.441
or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:56.631
but in human terms.

00:11:56.655 --> 00:12:01.240
When we put a human being in a cage
for days or weeks or months

00:12:01.264 --> 00:12:02.708
or even years,

00:12:02.732 --> 00:12:05.081
what are we doing
to that person's mind and body?

00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:07.863
Under what conditions
are we really willing to do that?

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:11.195
And so if starting with a few
hundred of us in this room,

00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:14.263
we can commit to thinking about
jailing in this different light,

00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:17.767
then we can undo that normalization
I was referring to earlier.

00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:20.829
If I leave you with anything today,
I hope it's with the thought

00:12:20.853 --> 00:12:23.285
that if we want anything
to fundamentally change --

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:26.589
not just to reform our policies
on bail and fines and fees --

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:29.666
but also to make sure that whatever
new policies replace those

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.741
don't punish the poor and the marginalized
in their own new way.

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:34.397
If we want that kind of change,

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.946
then this shift in thinking
is required of each of us.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.154
Thank you.

00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:41.848
(Applause)
