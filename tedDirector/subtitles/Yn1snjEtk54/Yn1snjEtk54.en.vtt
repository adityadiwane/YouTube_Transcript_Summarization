00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.976
There's an ancient and universal concept
that words have power,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.334
that spells exist,

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:34.055
and that if we could only
pronounce the right words,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.908
then -- whoosh! -- you know,
an avalanche would come

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.937
and wipe out the hobbits, right?

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.948
So this is a very attractive idea,

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:43.599
because we're very lazy,
like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.694
or the world's greatest
computer programmer.

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:47.628
This idea has a lot of traction with us.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:49.790
We love the idea that words,
when pronounced,

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:51.632
are little more than pure information,

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:53.915
but they evoke physical action
in the real world

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:55.098
that helps us do work.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.530
So, of course, with lots
of programmable computers

00:00:57.554 --> 00:00:58.705
and robots around,

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.561
this is an easy thing to picture.

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:02.650
How many of you know
what I'm talking about?

00:01:02.674 --> 00:01:03.825
Raise your right hand.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:05.852
How many don't know
what I'm talking about?

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.027
Raise your left hand.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.930
So that's great. So that was too easy.

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:13.073
You guys have very insecure computers, OK?

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:16.725
So now the thing is,
this is a different kind of spell.

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.106
This is a computer program
made of zeros and ones.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.988
It can be pronounced on a computer,
does something like this.

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:25.022
The important thing is we can write it
in a high-level language.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:27.008
A computer magician can write this thing.

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.246
It can be compiled into zeros and ones
and pronounced by a computer.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.269
And that's what makes computers powerful,

00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:34.553
these high-level languages
that can be compiled.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:37.433
And so, I'm here to tell you,
you don't need a computer

00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:39.351
to actually have a spell.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.660
In fact, what you can do
at the molecular level

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.658
is that if you encode information --

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:45.872
you encode a spell
or program as molecules --

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:49.515
then physics can actually directly
interpret that information

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.690
and run a program.

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:52.146
It's what happens in proteins.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.791
When this amino-acid sequence
gets pronounced as atoms,

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:57.035
these little letters
are sticky for each other.

00:01:57.059 --> 00:02:00.943
It collapses into a three-dimensional
shape that turns it into a nanomachine

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.537
that actually cuts DNA.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:05.314
The interesting thing
is that if you change the sequence,

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.346
you change the three-dimensional folding.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.330
You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:12.616
These are the kind of molecular programs
we want to be able to write.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.026
The problem is, we don't know

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.179
the machine language of proteins
or have a compiler for proteins.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.069
So I've joined a growing band of people

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.307
that try to make
molecular spells using DNA.

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:23.935
We use DNA because it's cheaper,
it's easier to handle,

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.030
it's something
we understand really well --

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:29.137
so well, in fact, that we think
we can actually write

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:32.574
programming languages for DNA
and have molecular compilers.

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:34.179
So then, we think we can do that.

00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:37.688
One of my first questions doing this was:

00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:40.483
How can you make an arbitrary shape
or pattern out of DNA?

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:42.718
I decided to use a type of DNA origami,

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:44.447
where you take a long strand of DNA

00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.280
and fold it into whatever shape
or pattern you might want.

00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:48.467
So here's a shape.

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:51.851
I actually spent about a year in my home
in my underwear, coding,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.027
like Linus [Torvalds],
in that picture before.

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.596
This program takes a shape
and spits out 250 DNA sequences.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.817
These short DNA sequences
are what are going to fold the long strand

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.610
into this shape that we want to make.

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.881
So you send an e-mail
with these sequences in it

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:06.057
to a company,

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.760
and the company pronounces them
on a DNA synthesizer,

00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:11.274
a machine about the size of a photocopier.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:13.274
And they take your e-mail,

00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:16.659
and every letter in your e-mail,
they replace with a 30-atom cluster --

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:19.089
one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:21.124
They string them up in the right sequence,

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:23.309
and then they send them
back to you via FedEx.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.774
So you get 250 of these
in the mail in little tubes.

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:28.241
I mix them together,
add a little bit of salt water,

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:30.801
and then add this long strand
I was telling you about,

00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:32.285
that I've stolen from a virus.

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:33.532
And then what happens is,

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.710
you heat this whole thing up
to about boiling.

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:37.796
You cool it down to room temperature,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.982
and as you do, those short strands
do the following thing:

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:44.402
each one of them binds
that long strand in one place,

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:47.974
and then has a second half that binds
that long strand in a distant place,

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:50.267
and brings those two parts
of the long strand

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.336
close together so they stick together.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.047
So the net effect
of all 250 of these strands

00:03:55.071 --> 00:03:59.398
is to fold the long strand
into the shape you're looking for.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:00.814
It'll approximate that shape.

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:02.667
We do this for real, in the test tube.

00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.659
In each little drop of water,
you get 50 billion of these guys.

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:07.998
With a microscope,
you can see them on a surface.

00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:11.137
The neat thing is if you change
the sequence and change the spell,

00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:13.092
just change the sequence of the staples,

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:15.918
you can make a molecule
that looks like this.

00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:18.952
And, you know, he likes
to hang out with his buddies.

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.862
A lot of them are actually pretty good.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.768
If you change the spell again,
you change the sequence again,

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:26.098
you get really nice,
130-nanometer triangles.

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:27.485
If you do it again,

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.720
you can get arbitrary patterns.

00:04:29.744 --> 00:04:34.141
So on a rectangle, you can paint
patterns of North and South America,

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.346
or the words, "DNA."

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.383
So that's DNA origami. That's one way.

00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:42.350
There are many ways
of casting molecular spells using DNA.

00:04:42.374 --> 00:04:44.116
What we really want to do in the end

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.976
is learn how to program self-assembly
so we can build anything, right?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.390
We want to be able to build
technological artifacts

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:52.075
that are maybe good for the world.

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.030
We want to learn how to build
biological artifacts,

00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:56.775
like people and whales and trees.

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:59.821
And if it's the case that we can reach
that level of complexity,

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:03.105
if our ability to program molecules
gets to be that good,

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.913
then that will truly be magic.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.040
Thank you very much.

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:08.214
(Applause)
