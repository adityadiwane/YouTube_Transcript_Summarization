00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:15.249
I want to tell you three stories

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:17.725
about the power of relationships

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.038
to solve the deep and complex
social problems of this century.

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.975
You know, sometimes it seems
like all these problems

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.788
of poverty, inequality, ill health,
unemployment, violence, addiction --

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:32.638
they're right there in one person's life.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:36.343
So I want to tell you about someone
like this that I know.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:38.436
I'm going to call her Ella.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.166
Ella lives in a British city
on a run down estate.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.384
The shops are closed, the pub's gone,

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:46.707
the playground's pretty desolate
and never used,

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:49.557
and inside Ella's house,
the tension is palpable

00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:51.581
and the noise levels are deafening.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.419
The TV's on at full volume.

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:55.975
One of her sons is fighting
with one of her daughters.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.770
Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this
constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:02.975
and the dogs are locked
behind the bedroom door and straining.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.711
Ella is stuck.

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:07.295
She has lived with crisis for 40 years.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.053
She knows nothing else,
and she knows no way out.

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:13.726
She's had a whole series
of abusive partners,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.067
and, tragically, one of her children has
been taken into care by social services.

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.363
The three children
that still live with her

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.862
suffer from a whole range of problems,
and none of them are in education.

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:26.883
And Ella says to me that she
is repeating the cycle

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:29.671
of her own mother's life before her.

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.975
But when I met Ella,
there were 73 different services

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.137
on offer for her and her family
in the city where she lives,

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:40.430
73 different services
run out of 24 departments in one city,

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:43.764
and Ella and her partners and her children
were known to most of them.

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:45.902
They think nothing of calling
social services

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:48.778
to try and mediate one of the many
arguments that broke out.

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:52.251
And the family home was visited
on a regular basis by social workers,

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:56.975
youth workers, a health officer,
a housing officer, a home tutor

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.975
and the local policemen.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.737
And the governments say
that there are 100,000 families

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.860
in Britain today like Ella's,

00:02:03.884 --> 00:02:09.245
struggling to break the cycle of economic,
social and environmental deprivation.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.443
And they also say
that managing this problem

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.469
costs a quarter of a million pounds
per family per year

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:15.865
and yet nothing changes.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.975
None of these well-meaning visitors
are making a difference.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.282
This is a chart we made in the same city
with another family like Ella's.

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:26.908
This shows 30 years of intervention
in that family's life.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:30.763
And just as with Ella, not one of these
interventions is part of an overall plan.

00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:32.234
There's no end goal in sight.

00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:35.309
None of the interventions
are dealing with the underlying issues.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.343
These are just containment measures,
ways of managing a problem.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.086
One of the policemen says to me,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.599
"Look, I just deliver the message
and then I leave."

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:45.308
So, I've spent time living
with families like Ella's

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.872
in different parts of the world,

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:49.134
because I want to know: what can we learn

00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:52.651
from places where our social institutions
just aren't working?

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:55.466
I want to know what it feels like
to live in Ella's family.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.501
I want to know what's going on
and what we can do differently.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:03.614
Well, the first thing I learned
is that cost is a really slippery concept.

00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:06.356
Because when the government says
that a family like Ella's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.977
costs a quarter of a million pounds
a year to manage,

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:10.152
what it really means

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:13.146
is that this system costs
a quarter of a million pounds a year.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.285
Because not one penny of this money
actually touches Ella's family

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.889
in a way that makes a difference.

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:20.456
Instead, the system is just
like this costly gyroscope

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.459
that spins around the families,
keeping them stuck at its heart,

00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:25.508
exactly where they are.

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:27.855
And I also spent time
with the frontline workers,

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.702
and I learned that it
is an impossible situation.

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:35.441
So Tom, who is the social worker
for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.975
has to spend 86 percent of his time
servicing the system:

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.070
meetings with colleagues,
filling out forms,

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.522
more meetings with colleagues
to discuss the forms,

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:44.792
and maybe most shockingly,

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:47.385
the 14 percent of the time
he has to be with Ryan

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.905
is spent getting data
and information for the system.

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.080
So he says to Ryan,

00:03:51.104 --> 00:03:53.791
"How often have you been smoking?
Have you been drinking?

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:55.128
When did you go to school?"

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.702
And this kind of interaction
rules out the possibility

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:58.938
of a normal conversation.

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:01.080
It rules out the possibility
of what's needed

00:04:01.104 --> 00:04:04.081
to build a relationship
between Tom and Ryan.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.388
When we made this chart,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.427
the frontline workers,
the professionals --

00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:10.222
they stared at it absolutely amazed.

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:12.975
It snaked around the walls
of their offices.

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:18.975
So many hours, so well meant,
but ultimately so futile.

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:22.439
And there was this moment
of absolute breakdown,

00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:24.295
and then of clarity:

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.932
we had to work in a different way.

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:30.957
So in a really brave step,
the leaders of the city where Ella lives

00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:33.626
agreed that we could start
by reversing Ryan's ratio.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.810
So everyone who came into contact
with Ella or a family like Ella's

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:39.746
would spend 80 percent of their time
working with the families

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.335
and only 20 percent servicing the system.

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:44.210
And even more radically,

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:45.404
the families would lead

00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:48.755
and they would decide who
was in a best position to help them.

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.138
So Ella and another mother were asked
to be part of an interview panel,

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:54.485
to choose from amongst
the existing professionals

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.776
who would work with them.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.766
And many, many people wanted to join us,

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.861
because you don't go into this kind
of work to manage a system,

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.738
you go in because you can
and you want to make a difference.

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.975
So Ella and the mother asked
everybody who came through the door,

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.431
"What will you do when my son
starts kicking me?"

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:12.975
And so the first person who comes in says,

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.118
"Well, I'll look around
for the nearest exit

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:17.975
and I will back out very slowly,

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.000
and if the noise is still going on,
I'll call my supervisor."

00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:23.737
And the mothers go,
"You're the system. Get out of here!"

00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:26.975
And then the next person who comes
is a policeman, and he says,

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.975
"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground
and then I'm not sure what I'll do."

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.677
And the mothers say, "Thank you."

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:34.923
So, they chose professionals who confessed

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:36.917
they didn't necessarily have the answers,

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:40.530
who said -- well, they weren't
going to talk in jargon.

00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:43.443
They showed their human qualities
and convinced the mothers

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.080
that they would stick with them
through thick and thin,

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:48.163
even though they wouldn't
be soft with them.

00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:49.879
So these new teams and the families

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:52.062
were then given a sliver
of the former budget,

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:54.577
but they could spend the money
in any way they chose.

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.836
And so one of the families
went out for supper.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.465
They went to McDonald's and they sat down
and they talked and they listened

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:02.549
for the first time in a long time.

00:06:02.573 --> 00:06:04.163
Another family asked the team

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:07.229
if they would help them do up their home.

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:08.760
And one mother took the money

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:12.311
and she used it as a float
to start a social enterprise.

00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:14.784
And in a really short space of time,

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.217
something new started to grow:

00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:20.139
a relationship between the team
and the workers.

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:23.080
And then some remarkable
changes took place.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.624
Maybe it's not surprising

00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:27.382
that the journey for Ella has had
some big steps backwards

00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:28.567
as well as forwards.

00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:31.356
But today, she's completed
an IT training course,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.668
she has her first paid job,
her children are back in school,

00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:35.843
and the neighbors,

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:38.776
who previously just hoped this family
would be moved anywhere

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.006
except next door to them,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.181
are fine.

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:43.305
They've made some new friendships.

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:47.345
And all the same people have been
involved in this transformation --

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:49.975
same families, same workers.

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.906
But the relationship between them
has been supported to change.

00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:57.637
So I'm telling you about Ella
because I think that relationships

00:06:57.661 --> 00:06:59.598
are the critical resource we have

00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:02.000
in solving some of these
intractable problems.

00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:04.746
But today, our relationships
are all but written off

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.638
by our politics, our social policies,
our welfare institutions.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:11.338
And I've learned that this
really has to change.

00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:13.952
So what do I mean by relationships?

00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:17.415
I'm talking about the simple
human bonds between us,

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.975
a kind of authentic sense
of connection, of belonging,

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:22.683
the bonds that make us happy,
that support us to change,

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:25.511
to be brave like Ella
and try something new.

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:27.455
And, you know, it's no accident

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.018
that those who run and work
in the institutions

00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:32.300
that are supposed to support
Ella and her family

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:33.838
don't talk about relationships,

00:07:33.862 --> 00:07:37.934
because relationships are expressly
designed out of a welfare model

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.416
that was drawn up in Britain
and exported around the world.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.373
The contemporaries of William Beveridge,

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:45.655
who was the architect
of the first welfare state

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:47.599
and the author of the Beveridge Report,

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:51.122
had little faith in what they called
the average sensual or emotional man.

00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:54.590
Instead, they trusted this idea
of the impersonal system

00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:58.975
and the bureaucrat who would be detached
and work in this system.

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.114
And the impact of Beveridge

00:08:01.138 --> 00:08:03.381
on the way the modern state
sees social issues

00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:05.464
just can't be underestimated.

00:08:05.488 --> 00:08:08.664
The Beveridge Report
sold over 100,000 copies

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.017
in the first weeks of publication alone.

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:14.250
People queued in the rain
on a November night to get hold of a copy,

00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:17.640
and it was read across the country,
across the colonies, across Europe,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.405
across the United States of America,

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:21.201
and it had this huge impact

00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:24.822
on the way that welfare states
were designed around the globe.

00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:29.907
The cultures, the bureaucracies,
the institutions -- they are global,

00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.951
and they've come to seem
like common sense.

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:34.059
They've become so ingrained in us,

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:36.330
that actually we don't even
see them anymore.

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:39.975
And I think it's really important to say
that in the 20th century,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.636
they were remarkably successful,
these institutions.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.091
They led to longer lifespans,
the eradication of mass disease,

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.106
mass housing, almost universal education.

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:51.975
But at the same time,

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.431
Beveridge sowed the seeds
of today's challenges.

00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:57.763
So let me tell you a second story.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:02.999
What do you think today is a bigger killer
than a lifetime of smoking?

00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:06.834
It's loneliness.

00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.657
According to government statistics,
one person over 60 -- one in three --

00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:15.873
doesn't speak to or see
another person in a week.

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:19.975
One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:22.334
doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.

00:09:22.924 --> 00:09:25.198
And we're not the only people
with this problem;

00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:27.653
this problem touches the whole
of the Western world.

00:09:27.677 --> 00:09:29.975
And it's even more acute
in countries like China,

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:33.682
where a process of rapid urbanization,
mass migration, has left older people

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.250
alone in the villages.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:39.095
And so the services that Beveridge
designed and exported --

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:41.406
they can't address this kind of problem.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.040
Loneliness is like a collective
relational challenge,

00:09:44.064 --> 00:09:47.911
and it can't be addressed
by a traditional bureaucratic response.

00:09:48.486 --> 00:09:51.437
So some years ago,
wanting to understand this problem,

00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:54.334
I started to work with a group
of about 60 older people

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:56.179
in South London, where I live.

00:09:56.203 --> 00:09:58.278
I went shopping, I played bingo,

00:09:58.302 --> 00:10:00.465
but mainly I was just
observing and listening.

00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:03.034
I wanted to know
what we could do differently.

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:06.665
And if you ask them, people tell you
they want two things.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.598
They want somebody to go up a ladder
and change a light bulb,

00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:11.920
or to be there when they
come out of hospital.

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.298
They want on-demand, practical support.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.880
And they want to have fun.

00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:19.122
They want to go out, do interesting things
with like-minded people,

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:22.866
and make friends like we've all
made friends at every stage of our lives.

00:10:23.478 --> 00:10:26.207
So we rented a phone line,
hired a couple of handymen,

00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:28.568
and started a service we called "Circle."

00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:32.413
And Circle offers its local membership
a toll-free 0 800 number

00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.166
that they can call on demand
for any support.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.359
And people have called us
for so many reasons.

00:10:37.383 --> 00:10:39.502
They've called because
their pets are unwell,

00:10:39.526 --> 00:10:42.800
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten
how to use their mobile phone,

00:10:42.824 --> 00:10:44.749
or maybe they are coming out of hospital

00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:46.426
and they want someone to be there.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.600
And Circle also offers
a rich social calendar --

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:53.739
knitting, darts, museum tours,
hot air ballooning -- you name it.

00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:58.650
But here's the interesting thing,
the really deep change:

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:01.885
over time, the friendships
that have formed

00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:04.463
have begun to replace the practical offer.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.597
So let me tell you about Belinda.

00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:10.857
Belinda's a Circle member, and she was
going into hospital for a hip operation,

00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:14.865
so she called her local Circle to say
they wouldn't see her for a bit.

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:18.689
And Damon, who runs the local Circle,
calls her back and says, "How can I help?"

00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:20.624
And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --

00:11:20.648 --> 00:11:23.441
Jocelyn is doing the shopping,
Tony's doing the gardening,

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:26.162
Melissa and Joe are going
to come in and cook and chat."

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.193
So five Circle members
had organized themselves

00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.121
to take care of Belinda.

00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:35.469
And Belinda's 80, although she says
that she feels 25 inside,

00:11:35.493 --> 00:11:37.057
but she also says

00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:40.527
that she felt stuck and pretty down
when she joined Circle.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:45.564
But the simple act of encouraging her
to come along to that first event

00:11:45.588 --> 00:11:48.788
led to a process where
natural friendships formed,

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:53.133
friendships that today are replacing
the need for expensive services.

00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:56.134
It's relationships
that are making the difference.

00:11:57.572 --> 00:12:00.480
So I think that three factors
have converged

00:12:00.504 --> 00:12:03.496
that enable us to put relationships
at the heart and center

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.365
of how we solve social problems today.

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:08.452
Firstly, the nature of the problems --

00:12:08.476 --> 00:12:11.131
they've changed, and they require
different solutions.

00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:15.645
Secondly, the cost, human as much
as financial, of doing business as usual.

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.404
And thirdly, technology.

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:20.529
I've talked about the first two factors.

00:12:20.553 --> 00:12:23.501
It's technology that enables
these approaches to scale

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:26.479
and potentially now support
thousands of people.

00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:29.070
So the technology we've used
is really simple,

00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:32.547
it's made up of available things
like databases, mobile phones.

00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:35.307
Circle has got this very simple
system that underpins it,

00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:39.191
enables a small local team to support
a membership of up to a thousand.

00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:41.988
And you can contrast this
with a neighborhood organization

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.169
of the 1970s,

00:12:43.193 --> 00:12:45.356
when this kind of scale
just wasn't possible,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.496
neither was the quality or the longevity
that the spine of technology can provide.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.749
So it's relationships
underpinned by technology

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:55.686
that can turn the Beveridge
models on their heads.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.356
The Beveridge models are all
about institutions with finite resources,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.821
anonymously managing access.

00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:03.465
In my work at the front line,

00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:07.175
I've seen again and again how
up to 80 percent of resource

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.234
is spent keeping people out.

00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:10.948
So professionals have to administer

00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:13.366
these increasingly complex forms
of administration

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.732
that are basically about stopping people
accessing the service

00:13:16.756 --> 00:13:18.483
or managing the queue.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.266
And Circle, like the relational services
that we and others have designed,

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.655
inverts this logic.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:28.672
What it says is, the more people,
the more relationships,

00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:30.752
the stronger the solution.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:34.096
So I want to tell you my third
and final story,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.079
which is about unemployment.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.066
In Britain, as in most places
in the world,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.630
our welfare states were primarily designed

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:45.299
to get people into work,

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.315
to educate them for this,

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:49.011
and to keep them healthy.

00:13:49.035 --> 00:13:51.568
But here, too, the systems are failing.

00:13:51.592 --> 00:13:52.964
And so the response has been

00:13:52.988 --> 00:13:56.525
to try and make these old systems
even more efficient and transactional --

00:13:56.549 --> 00:14:00.181
to speed up processing times, divide
people into ever-smaller categories,

00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:03.376
try and target services at them
more efficiently -- in other words,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.046
the very opposite of relational.

00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:10.829
But guess how most people find work today?

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.375
Through word of mouth.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:18.000
It turns out that in Britain today,
most new jobs are not advertised.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.167
So it's friends that tell you about a job,

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:22.464
it's friends that recommend you for a job,

00:14:22.488 --> 00:14:26.779
and it's a rich and diverse social network
that helps you find work.

00:14:26.803 --> 00:14:29.128
Maybe some of you here
this evening are thinking,

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.013
"But I found my job through an advert,"

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.359
but if you think back, it was probably
a friend that showed you the ad

00:14:34.383 --> 00:14:35.960
and then encouraged you to apply.

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:37.307
But not surprisingly,

00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:40.610
people who perhaps most need
this rich and diverse network

00:14:40.634 --> 00:14:43.333
are those who are most isolated from it.

00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:44.632
So knowing this,

00:14:44.656 --> 00:14:47.678
and also knowing about the costs
and failure of current systems,

00:14:47.702 --> 00:14:50.651
we designed something new
with relationships at its heart.

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:56.037
We designed a service
that encourages people to meet up,

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.501
people in and out of work,

00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.276
to work together in structured ways

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.217
and try new opportunities.

00:15:02.308 --> 00:15:06.279
And, well, it's very hard to compare
the results of these new systems

00:15:06.303 --> 00:15:07.975
with the old transactional models,

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:10.300
but it looks like,
with our first 1,000 members,

00:15:10.324 --> 00:15:13.215
we outperformed existing services
by a factor of three,

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:15.199
at a fraction of the cost.

00:15:15.223 --> 00:15:18.103
And here, too, we've used technology,

00:15:18.127 --> 00:15:21.525
but not to network people in the way
that a social platform would do.

00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:25.151
We've used it to bring people face to face
and connect them with each other,

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.592
building real relationships
and supporting people to find work.

00:15:30.308 --> 00:15:33.255
At the end of his life, in 1948,

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.268
Beveridge wrote a third report.

00:15:35.913 --> 00:15:39.274
And in it he said he had made
a dreadful mistake.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:44.179
He had left people
and their communities out.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:49.716
And this omission, he said,
led to seeing people,

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.875
and people starting to see themselves,

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:55.684
within the categories
of the bureaucracies and the institutions.

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:58.473
And human relationships
were already withering.

00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:02.512
But unfortunately, this third report
was much less read

00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:04.311
than Beveridge's earlier work.

00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:09.326
But today, we need to bring people
and their communities

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.477
back into the heart of the way
we design new systems and new services,

00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:16.008
in an approach that I call
"Relational Welfare."

00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:18.548
We need to leave behind
these old, transactional,

00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:20.830
unsuitable, outdated models,

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:24.365
and we need to adopt instead
the shared collective relational responses

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:26.845
that can support a family like Ella's,

00:16:26.869 --> 00:16:29.176
that can address an issue like loneliness,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.935
that can support people into work
and up the skills curve

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:33.403
in a modern labor market,

00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:37.565
that can also address challenges
of education, of health care systems,

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:41.869
and so many more of those problems
that are pressing on our societies.

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:44.868
It is all about relationships.

00:16:45.324 --> 00:16:48.351
Relationships are the critical
resource we have.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:49.526
Thank you.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:54.999
(Applause)
