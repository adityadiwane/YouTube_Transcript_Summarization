00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.330
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330
that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.330
as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
And visiting some pretty incredible places,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.330
places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I was here a month ago.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.330
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
You see some incredible stuff.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
And you get to make these spot comparisons

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
between people all around the globe.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
And the thing that you really take away from that,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
but rather how different we are.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
There is so much diversity around the globe.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
all different colors, shapes, sizes.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
How do we explain that diversity?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
is how we're using the tools of genetics,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.330
population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and how long it took.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Now, the problem of human diversity,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
like all big scientific questions --

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
how do you explain something like that --

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
can be broken down into sub-questions.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
First one is really a question of origins.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
When did we originate as a species?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
How long have we been divergent from each other?

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And the second question is related, but slightly different.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
If we do spring from a common source,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
and in the process generate all of this diversity,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
the different ways of life, the different appearances,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
the different languages around the world?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
"In each great region of the world, the living mammals

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
and as these two species are now man's nearest allies,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
lived on the African continent than elsewhere."

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.330
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
our common ancestry with apes.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
became the gibbons and the orangutans.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
And the ones that stayed on in Africa

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
But that's not really the question I'm asking.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
I'm asking about our human ancestry,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
things that we would recognize as being like us

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
if they were sitting here in the room.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
If they were peering over your shoulder,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Because if we go far enough back,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
How do we study that?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
Digging things up out of the ground,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
and largely on the basis of morphology --

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
This must be who I'm directly descended from."

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
What do I mean by that?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
You're looking at a great example here.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
These are three extinct species of hominids,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
potential human ancestors.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.330
the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
again, largely skull shape.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.330
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
to categorize every living organism on the planet.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
You think you've got a tough job?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And he did a pretty good job.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.330
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.330
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
which basically included all the people he didn't like,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
including imaginary folk like elves.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.330
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
working in the pre-Darwinian era.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
basically that same classification of humanity.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.330
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
Carlton Coon is the best example --

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
But based on what data?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Well, what I'm going to talk about today,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
and saying it on the basis of morphology --

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
which we still don't completely understand,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
or a genealogical question.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.330
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
And as any genealogist will tell you --

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
You gradually trace further and further back into the past,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
adding these ever more distant relationships.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.330
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.330
and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
Who were these people who came before?

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code --

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
we have a historical document that takes us back in time

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.330
to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
Now, a quick primer on DNA.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.330
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.330
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.330
a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
And the whole thing, if you add it all together,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
is over six billion nucleotides long.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.330
and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
thousands of times. It's a lot of information.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:56.330
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Now multiply it by 100.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
And imagine copying that by hand.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
And you're working away until late at night,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
and you're paying attention, but, occasionally,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
when you're copying this by hand,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.330
substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
through the generations, they become markers of descent.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
If you share a marker with someone,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
the person who first had that change in their DNA.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.330
the pattern of these markers in people all over the world,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
all the way back to the very first woman.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
traces a purely paternal line of descent.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.330
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.330
falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
What's the take-home message?

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
is that the deepest lineages in our family trees

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.330
are found within Africa, among Africans.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.330
That means that Africans have been accumulating

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
this mutational diversity for longer.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.330
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
But what's even more amazing

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.330
the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
only lived around 60,000 years ago.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
That's only about 2,000 human generations,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
This was an African man who gave rise

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
It's only within the last 60,000 years

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Such an amazing story.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
or sub-species rather, human races around the world?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.330
particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
the ones that are tough to answer.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.330
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
Lots of evidence from sediment cores

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.330
getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.330
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.330
about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
and there aren't a lot of glaciers here,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
except on the high mountains here in East Africa.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
This is a paleo-climatological map

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
So the whole world was drying out.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
compared to what we have today.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
The evidence from genetic data

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
And then something happened. A great illustration of it.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
Look at some stone tools.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.330
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
not our direct ancestors, living in Europe,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.330
and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
or physical anthropologists in the audience,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.330
basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.330
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
The tool styles don't change that much.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
The evidence is that the human way of life

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
didn't change that much during that period.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:52.330
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
at particular times of the year.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
The population size started to expand.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
Probably, according to what many linguists believe,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.330
fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:25.330
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.330
and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
around 60, 70 thousand years ago --

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.330
leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.330
reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
These would have been savannah hunters.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
And it's basically a meat locker.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
People who would have specialized in killing the animals,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.330
following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
because that's what they were adapted to live on.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
And when they reached Central Asia,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
a grassland super-highway.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
and the entire continent was open to them.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
and finally, a small group migrating up

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.330
through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.330
inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.330
temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.330
migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.330
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
The changes that allowed us to do that,

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.330
the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
allowing us to create novel cultures,

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.330
allowing us to develop the diversity

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.330
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.330
of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.330
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.330
in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.330
And as we were finishing up that film --

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.330
it was co-produced with National Geographic --

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.330
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
"You know, we really see this as kind of

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.330
the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:56.330
using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.330
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.330
and we want to take it to the next level.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
What do you want to do next?"

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.330
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.330
It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
you know, a handful of populations around the world.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.330
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.330
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.330
is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.330
hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.330
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.330
The project launched in April 2005.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.330
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.330
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.330
retain a connection to the place where they live

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.330
that many of the rest of us have lost.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.330
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.330
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.330
Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.330
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.330
that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.330
That's the focus of the field research,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.330
the centers that we've set up all over the world --

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.330
10 of them, top population geneticists.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.330
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.330
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.330
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.330
In this case, you actually can.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.330
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.330
And you can actually submit those results to the database,

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.330
and tell us a little about your genealogical background,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.330
have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.330
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.330
after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.330
gets plowed back into the project.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.330
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.330
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.330
that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.330
for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.330
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.330
and I'll show you a couple of examples.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.330
So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.330
collected from indigenous people around the world.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.330
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.330
210,000 people have ordered these participation kits

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.330
since we launched two years ago,

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.330
which has raised around five million dollars,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.330
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.330
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.330
preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.330
language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.330
So the project is going very, very well,

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.330
and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.330
Thank you very much.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.330
