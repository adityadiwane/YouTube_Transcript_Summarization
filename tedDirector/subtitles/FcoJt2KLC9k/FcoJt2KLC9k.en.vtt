00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
So how would you run a whole country without oil?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
That's the question that sort of hit me

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
It never left my brain.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
So I went out and researched ethanol,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
which is, you actually use more

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
clean electrons than the ones you get

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
inside a car, if you use hydrogen.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
So that is not going to be the path to go.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And then sort of through a process of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
wandering around, I got to the thought

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
in a way that is convenient and affordable,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
you could get to a solution.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
Now I started this from a point of view that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
it has to be something that scales en masse.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Not how do you build one car,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
but how do you scale this so that it can become

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
something that is used by 99 percent of the population?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
as any car that you would have today.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.330
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
So we're bound with the laws of physics

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and the laws of economics.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And so the thought that I started with was

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
how do you do this, still within the boundary

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
of the science we know today --

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
or waiting for the magic battery to show up.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
How do you do it within the economics that we have today?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
And not from the power of an edict down.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
I actually found out that the answer comes

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
from separating between the car ownership

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
and the battery ownership.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
"batteries not included."

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Now if you separate between the two,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
you could actually answer the need for a convenient car

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
by creating a network,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
by creating a network before the cars show up.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
The network has two components in them.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And so the first thought that came to mind is,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
everywhere we park we have electric power.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
like Scandinavia, you already have that.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Now that last mile,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
last foot, in a sense,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.330
is the first step of the infrastructure.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
of the range extension.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.330
reasonable space and weight limitations.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.330
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
But you never want to get stuck.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
So what we added is a second element to our network,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
which is a battery swap system.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
within two minutes you're back on the road

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and you can go again.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
If you had charge spots everywhere,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
and you had battery swap stations everywhere,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
how often would you do it? And it ends up

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.330
that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
we start paying you money

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
because it's an inconvenience.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Then we looked at the question of the affordability.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
disconnected from the car.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
What is the cost of that battery?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
something interesting happens.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
You have the crude oil.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
as what we call petrol or gasoline.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
as the gas tank.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
step after step after step.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And so it's sort of a mini well.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
In a sense what we've done is

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
we've created a new consumable.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
You, today, buy gasoline miles.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
And we created electric miles.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
Today 2010, in volume,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
in the average consumer

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
environment we're in in the U.S.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
In Europe where taxes are in place,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.330
that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.330
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
to four cents a mile in 2015,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
to two cents a mile by 2020.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
So in a sense this is

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
by 2020, which is our desire.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
That is an 80 cent gallon.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
would convert to crude oil,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
they still can't compete with two cents a mile.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
That's a new economic factor,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
which is fascinating to most people.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Now this would have been a wonderful paper.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
And some governments told me that it's fascinating

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
that the younger generation actually thinks about these things.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.330
(Laughter)

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
Until I got to the

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
200 million dollars,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
and if you can find a car company

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
that will build that car in mass volume,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.330
I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
Peres thought that was a great idea.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
We sent letters to all the car companies.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
He said hybrids are like mermaids.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
When you want a fish you get a woman and

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
when you need a woman you get a fish.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
(Laughter)

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
And Ghosn came up and said,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
that will come into the market in mass volume --

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
It's the first mass-volume electric car,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
zero-emission electric car in the market.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.330
I was running, as Chris said,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
that you would go and do?"

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
We then decided to scale it up.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And Denmark set this beautiful policy;

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
it's called the IQ test.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
It's inversely proportional to taxes.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.330
They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
and zero tax on zero-emission cars.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.330
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
(Laughter)

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
We then were sort of coined as the guys

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
who run only in small islands.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
(Laughter)

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
It's got three centers --

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
The next island

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
We decided to come into the U.S.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
and pick the two best places --

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
the one where you didn't need any range extension.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
And if you really have a long day you can switch,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
and keep on driving around the island.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
He decided that he's going to take over

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
the state, unofficially, and then officially,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.330
and then created this beautiful Region One policy.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
the highest concentration of Priuses,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
but you also have the perfect range extender.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
It's called the other car.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
As we stared scaling it up

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
Why is this a big issue?

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
when you have small problems on the individual level,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
you're dead. Alright?

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
So the price of oil, much like

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
lots of other curves that we've seen,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
goes along a depletion curve.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
You think, well it's been up, it's been down,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Here is the problem:

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.330
the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
Now we're running a stimulus package.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.330
We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
somewhere in that space.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
What happens when the economy recovers?

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.330
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
even at the pace we're going at right now.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
That is another 25 million barrels a day.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.330
That's all the U.S. usage today.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
also known as 200 dollars a barrel.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
We take our money and we give it away.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
You know what happens at that point?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
And the downs are going to be much longer

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
and the ups are going to be much shorter.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
And that's the difference between problems that are additive,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and problems that are depletive,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
in which we lose what we have,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
which oscillate, and they oscillate until

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
we lose everything we've got.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
Right? Remember in the campaign: one million

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
hybrid cars by 2015.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.330
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.330
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
That won't do much difference.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
We looked at an MIT study:

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
ten million electric cars on the global roads.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.330
Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
It's also the most optimistic number

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
because it means we will scale this industry

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
from 100 thousand cars is 2011,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.330
to 10 million cars by 2016 --

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.330
100 x growth in less than five years.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
We have 10 million cars by region.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
That's an enormous amount of cars.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
China is adding those cars --

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
India, Russia, Brazil.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
We have all these regions.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
They'll be the first in line to get off

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
because their prices are high.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
We don't have the industry set right.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
across the U.S.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Now where is the car industry on that?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
we'll solve everything within the car itself."

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
No infrastructure, no problem.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
We forgot about the entire chain around us.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
All this stuff that happens around.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
a whole new market, a whole new business model.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
to drive the car --

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
the minutes, the miles if you want,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
that you are all familiar with --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
subsidize the price of the car,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And some of it will go back to the car maker.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.330
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
from windmills, not from oil.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.330
In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
in the south of Israel.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
instead of digging down.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.330
These are perfect matches to one another.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
Now all you need is about 10 percent

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
of the electricity generated.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
That's one percent a year.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
Now when we're looking at solving big problems,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
we need to start thinking in two numbers.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.330
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
and scale it infinity.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
that are willing to go to this kind of scale.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
One car emits four tons.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
And actually 700 and change million cars today

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.330
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.330
We have to come and attack this problem

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.330
with a focus, with an effort that actually says,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.330
we're going to go to zero before the world ends.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.330
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:11.330
I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
I told him one of the reasons that

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.330
his uncle was remembered

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
and we'll do it by the end of the decade.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
(Laughter)

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
there was a long argument

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
over economy versus morality.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.330
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
25 percent of their energy

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.330
for the entire industrial world in the U.K.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.330
came from a source of energy that was immoral:

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
human slaves.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
And what would it do to our economy?

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and keep the slaves.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.330
And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.330
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.330
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
We have to make the right moral decision.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.330
We have to make it immediately.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.330
We need to have presidential leadership

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.330
just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.330
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.330
but within this presidential term

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.330
because if we don't, we will lose our economy,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
right after we'd lost our morality.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
Thank you all very much.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:59.330
(Applause)
