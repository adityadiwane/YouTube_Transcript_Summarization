00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is the venue

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
where, as a young man,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
some of the music that I wrote was first performed.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It was, remarkably,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
a pretty good sounding room.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
it actually sounded pretty good.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
This is a song that was recorded there.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
(Music)

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
This is not Talking Heads,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
in the picture anyway.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.260
(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So the nature of the room

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
meant that words could be understood.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
The sound system was kind of decent.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
So the rhythms

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
could be pretty intact too,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
pretty concise.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Other places around the country had similar rooms.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The music was in some ways different,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
but in structure and form,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
very much the same.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And so the bands at Tootsie's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
or at CBGB's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
had to play loud enough --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
the volume had to be loud enough to overcome

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
people falling down, shouting out

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and doing whatever else they were doing.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Since then, I've played other places

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that are much nicer.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I've played the Disney Hall here

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and Carnegie Hall and places like that.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And it's been very exciting.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But I also noticed that sometimes the music

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that I had written,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
or was writing at the time,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
didn't sound all that great

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in some of those halls.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
We managed,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
to the music I was making

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
or had made.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So I asked myself:

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Do I write stuff

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
for specific rooms?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Do I have a place, a venue,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in mind when I write?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Is that a kind of model for creativity?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Do we all make things with

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
a venue, a context, in mind?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Okay, Africa.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Most of the popular music that we know now

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
has a big part of its roots in West Africa.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And the music there,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I would say, the instruments,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
the intricate rhythms,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
the way it's played, the setting, the context,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
it's all perfect. It all works perfect.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
The music works perfectly in that setting.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
There's no big room

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
The instruments are loud enough

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It's no accident.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
It's perfect for that particular context.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And it would be a mess

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.260
(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It doesn't change key, the notes are long,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
there's almost no rhythm whatsoever,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and the room flatters the music.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It actually improves it.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
This is the room that Bach

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
He can, very innovatively,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
actually change keys

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
without risking huge dissonances.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.260
(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
This is a little bit later.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
They're smaller, even less reverberant,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
so he can write really frilly music

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that's very intricate -- and it works.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It fits the room perfectly.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
This is La Scala.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
It's around the same time,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I think it was built around 1776.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
they used to yell out to one another.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
If they liked an aria,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
they would holler and suggest

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that it be done again as an encore,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
not at the end of the show, but immediately.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
(Laughter)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And well, that was an opera experience.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And the size of the room is not that big.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
It's smaller than this.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
But Wagner made an innovation.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
He wanted a bigger band.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
He wanted a little more bombast,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
so he increased the size of the orchestra pit

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
so he could get more low-end instruments in there.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:27.260
(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Okay.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
This is Carnegie Hall.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And they're a lot more reverberant

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
than La Scala.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Around the same,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
this kind of rule came into effect

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
that audiences had to be quiet --

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
or gossiping with one another

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
during the show.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
They had to be very quiet.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
So those two things combined meant that

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
a different kind of music

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
worked best in these kind of halls.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
which there weren't in some of these

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
other kinds of music.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Quiet parts could be heard

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that would have been drowned out

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
by all the gossiping and shouting.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
But because of the reverberation

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
in those rooms like Carnegie Hall,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and a little more textural.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
This is Mahler.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
That was Bob's last record, yeah.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
(Laughter)

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Popular music, coming along at the same time.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
This is a jazz band.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
on riverboats and clubs.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
that the dancers really liked.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And they'd say, "Play that part again."

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Well, there's only so many times

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And a new form of music was born.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
These are played mainly in small rooms.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
So the music has to be loud enough

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
to be heard above that.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century --

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
for the whole of 20th-century popular music,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
when this became

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
one of the primary venues for music.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And this was one way

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that the music got there.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Microphones enabled singers, in particular,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and musicians and composers,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
to completely change the kind of music

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
that they were writing.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
but singers, like Frank Sinatra,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
could use the mic

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and do things

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that they could never do without a microphone.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Other singers after him

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
went even further.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:33.260
(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
This is Chet Baker.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And this kind of thing

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
would have been impossible without a microphone.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
And he's singing right into your ear.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
He's whispering into your ears.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
The effect is just electric.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
It's like the guy is sitting next to you,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
whispering who knows what into your ear.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
So at this point, music diverged.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
There's live music,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
and there's recorded music.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and there's jukeboxes in bars,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
where you don't even need to have a band.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
There doesn't need to be any

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
live performing musicians whatsoever,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and the sound systems are good.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
People began to make music

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
specifically for discos

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and for those sound systems.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And, as with jazz,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
the dancers liked certain sections

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
more than they did others.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:45.260
(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
The MC would improvise lyrics

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And another new form of music was born.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
ended up in what is probably, acoustically,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
the worst sounding venues on the planet:

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
sports stadiums,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
basketball arenas and hockey arenas.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
They wrote what is now called arena rock,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
which is medium-speed ballads.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:22.260
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
They did the best they could

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
given that this is what they're writing for.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
It's more a social situation

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
than a musical situation.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And in some ways, the music

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
that they're writing for this place

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
works perfectly.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
So there's more new venues.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
One of the new ones is the automobile.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
I grew up with a radio in a car.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
But now that's evolved into something else.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
The car is a whole venue.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.260
(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz)

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
The music that, I would say, is written

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
for automobile sound systems

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
works perfectly on it.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
It might not be what you want to listen to at home,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
but it works great in the car --

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
has a huge frequency spectrum,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
you know, big bass and high-end

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
There's one other kind of new venue,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
the private MP3 player.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
(Laughter)

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
or when the audience had to hush up,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
because you can now hear every single detail.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
In other ways, it's more like the West African music

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
you turn it up, and the next minute,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So that doesn't really work.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
I think pop music, mainly,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
it's written today,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
to some extent, is written for these kind of players,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
for this kind of personal experience

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
where you can hear extreme detail,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
but the dynamic doesn't change that much.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
So I asked myself:

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Okay, is this

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
a model for creation,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
this adaptation that we do?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And does it happen anywhere else?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
birds do it too --

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
that the birds in the canopy,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
where the foliage is dense,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
their calls tend to be

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
high-pitched, short and repetitive.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And the birds on the floor

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
tend to have lower pitched calls,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
so that they don't get distorted

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
when they bounce off the forest floor.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And birds like this Savannah sparrow,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
they tend to have a buzzing

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
type call.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
And it turns out that

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
a sound like this

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
is the most energy efficient and practical way

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
to transmit their call

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
across the fields and savannahs.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Other birds, like this tanager,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
have adapted within the same species.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
where the forests are a little denser,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
has one kind of call,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and the tananger on the other side, on the west

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
has a different kind of call.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So birds do it too.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And I thought:

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Well, if this is a model for creation,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
if we make music,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
primarily the form at least,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
to fit these contexts,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
is that how it works?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
It's adaptive.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
is still there.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
This is a reverse view of things

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
from the kind of traditional Romantic view.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
The Romantic view is that

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
first comes the passion

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and then the outpouring of emotion,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and then somehow it gets shaped into something.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And I'm saying,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
well, the passion's still there,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
but the vessel

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
that it's going to be injected into and poured into,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
that is instinctively and intuitively

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
created first.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
We already know where that passion is going.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
The writer,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Thomas Frank,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
says that

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
this might be a kind of explanation

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
why some voters vote

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
against their best interests,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
that voters, like a lot of us,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
that it's more authentic.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
And they'll vote for that.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
if they can fake passion,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
they stand a better chance

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
of being selected in that way,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
which seems a little dangerous.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
are not mutually exclusive.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
that we are like the birds.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We adapt.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
We sing.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And like the birds, the joy is still there,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
even though we have changed what we do

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
to fit the context.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.260
(Applause)
