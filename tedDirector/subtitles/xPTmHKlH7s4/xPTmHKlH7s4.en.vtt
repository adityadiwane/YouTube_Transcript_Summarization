00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:16.386
There are 39 million people in the world

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:17.876
who are blind.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:20.350
Eighty percent of them

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.169
are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.118
and the absolute majority

00:00:25.118 --> 00:00:26.625
do not need to be blind.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.480
They are blind from diseases

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.256
that are either completely curable or preventable.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.768
Knowing this, with my young family,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.162
we moved to Kenya.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.969
We secured equipment,

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.668
funds, vehicles, we trained a team,

00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:43.692
we set up a hundred clinics throughout

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:45.190
the Great Rift Valley

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.651
to try and understand a single question:

00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:50.737
why are people going blind,

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:53.656
and what can we do?

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.570
The challenges were great.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.401
When we got to where we were going,

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:01.067
we set up our high-tech equipment.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:03.246
Power was rarely available.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:04.099
We'd have to run our equipment

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.999
from petrol power generators.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.946
And then something occurred to me:

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:11.441
There has to be an easier way,

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.441
because it's the patients who are the most in need

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:14.999
of access to eye care

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.340
who are the least likely to get it.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.446
More people in Kenya,

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.358
and in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.149
have access to a mobile phone

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.302
than they do clean running water.

00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:26.021
So we said, could we harness

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:27.640
the power of mobile technology

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.791
to deliver eye care in a new way?

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.576
And so we developed Peek,

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:34.114
a smartphone [system] that enables

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.626
community healthcare workers

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:39.456
and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:42.126
We set about replacing
traditional hospital equipment,

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:44.649
which is bulky, expensive and fragile,

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.684
with smartphone apps and hardware

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.821
that make it possible to test anyone

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:52.010
in any language and of any age.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.814
Here we have a demonstration

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.537
of a three-month-old having their vision

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:59.910
accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.393
We've got many trials going on

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.593
in the community and in schools,

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.493
and through the lessons that
we've learned in the field,

00:02:09.493 --> 00:02:11.196
we've realized it's extremely important

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.056
to share the data in non-medical jargon

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.717
so that people understand

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:18.340
what we're examining and what that means to them.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.614
So here, for example,

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:21.470
we use our sight sim application,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.262
once your vision has been measured,

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:25.972
to show carers and teachers

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.486
what the visual world is like for that person,

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:31.952
so they can empathize with them and help them.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.340
Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.911
the next big challenge is to work out why,

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.028
and to be able to do that,

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.529
we need to have access to the inside of the eye.

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.115
Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.196
to examine an area called the retina.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:48.005
The retina is the single part of the eye that has

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.101
huge amounts of information about the body

00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:51.889
and its health.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.700
We've developed 3D-printed,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.141
low-cost hardware

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.541
that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,

00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.484
which can then be clipped onto a smartphone

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:01.926
and makes it possible to get views

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.147
of the back of the eye

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:04.903
of a very high quality.

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.100
And the beauty is, anybody can do it.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.979
In our trials on over two and half thousand people,

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.896
the smartphone with the add-on clip

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.577
is comparable to a camera

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.472
that is hugely more expensive

00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:20.061
and hugely more difficult to transport.

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.940
When we first moved to Kenya,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.593
we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,

00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:27.050
a team of 15 people,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.942
and that was what was
needed to deliver health care.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.307
Now, all that's needed

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:34.099
is a single person

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.495
on a bike with a smartphone.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:41.349
And it costs just 500 dollars.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.219
The issue of power supply

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.780
is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.920
Our healthcare workers travel

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.465
with a solar-powered rucksack

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.926
which keeps the phone charged and backed up.

00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:53.196
Now we go to the patient

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.907
rather than waiting for the patient never to come.

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:57.640
We go to them in their homes

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.437
and we give them the most comprehensive,

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:01.377
high-tech, accurate examination,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:05.481
which can be delivered by
anyone with minimal training.

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.318
We can link global experts

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:10.060
with people in the most rural,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.250
difficult-to-reach places

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.839
that are beyond the end of the road,

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.353
effectively putting those experts in their homes,

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:17.331
allowing us to make diagnoses

00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:20.399
and make plans for treatment.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.126
Project managers, hospital directors,

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:25.045
are able to search on our interface

00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:27.047
by any parameter they may be interested in.

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:29.070
Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.406
we can search for people

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:31.850
by whatever condition.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.122
Here are people who are blind

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:35.652
from a curable condition cataract.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:37.681
Each red pin depicts somebody

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:40.338
who is blind from a disease that is curable

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:42.584
and treatable, and they're locatable.

00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:44.468
We can use bulk text messaging services

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.622
to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.

00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:50.237
What's more, we've learned that this is something

00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:52.275
that we haven't built just for the community

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:53.860
but with the community.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.112
Those blue pins that drop represent

00:04:56.112 --> 00:04:58.213
elders, or local leaders,

00:04:58.213 --> 00:04:59.452
that are connected to those people

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:00.785
who can ensure that we can find them

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:02.886
and arrange treatment.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.888
So for patients like Mama Wangari,

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.484
who have been blind for over 10 years

00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:09.113
and never seen her grandchildren,

00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:12.931
for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.

00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:18.209
This is something that has to happen.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:19.840
It's only in statistics

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.563
that people go blind by the millions.

00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:26.431
The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.408
But now, they might just be

00:05:28.408 --> 00:05:30.547
a text message away from help.

00:05:30.547 --> 00:05:36.483
(Applause)

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.426
And now because live demos are always a bad idea,

00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:41.224
we're going to try a live demo.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:42.480
(Laughter)

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.165
So here we have the Peek Vision app.

00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:54.786
Okay, and what we're looking at here,

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:56.281
this is Sam's optic nerve,

00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.680
which is a direct extension of her brain,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.289
so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.820
We can see all parts of the retina.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.350
It makes it possible to pick up diseases

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.517
of the eye and of the body

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:12.046
that would not be possible without access to the eye,

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.981
and that clip-on device can be manufactured

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:15.531
for just a few dollars,

00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.162
and people can be cured of blindness,

00:06:17.162 --> 00:06:20.385
and I think it says a lot about us as a human race

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:22.910
if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.108
But now we can.

00:06:24.108 --> 00:06:26.324
Thank you.

00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:28.488
(Applause)
