00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.735
Let's imagine a sculptor
building a statue,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.136
just chipping away with his chisel.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.216
Michelangelo had this elegant way
of describing it when he said,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.136
"Every block of stone
has a statue inside of it,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.256
and it's the task
of the sculptor to discover it."

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.696
But what if he worked
in the opposite direction?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.576
Not from a solid block of stone,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.296
but from a pile of dust,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.696
somehow gluing millions of these particles
together to form a statue.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.216
I know that's an absurd notion.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.976
It's probably impossible.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.936
The only way you get
a statue from a pile of dust

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.296
is if the statue built itself --

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.456
if somehow we could compel millions
of these particles to come together

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.760
to form the statue.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.856
Now, as odd as that sounds,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.016
that is almost exactly the problem
I work on in my lab.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.456
I don't build with stone,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.856
I build with nanomaterials.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.256
They're these just impossibly small,
fascinating little objects.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.576
They're so small that if this controller
was a nanoparticle,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.536
a human hair would be the size
of this entire room.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.376
And they're at the heart of a field
we call nanotechnology,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.215
which I'm sure we've all heard about,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.696
and we've all heard
how it is going to change everything.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.216
When I was a graduate student,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.576
it was one of the most exciting times
to be working in nanotechnology.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.816
There were scientific breakthroughs
happening all the time.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.256
The conferences were buzzing,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.960
there was tons of money
pouring in from funding agencies.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.016
And the reason is

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.856
when objects get really small,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.496
they're governed by a different set
of physics that govern ordinary objects,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.016
like the ones we interact with.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.976
We call this physics quantum mechanics.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.176
And what it tells you is
that you can precisely tune their behavior

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.496
just by making seemingly
small changes to them,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.136
like adding or removing
a handful of atoms,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.856
or twisting the material.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.656
It's like this ultimate toolkit.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.776
You really felt empowered;
you felt like you could make anything.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.056
And we were doing it --

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.176
and by we I mean my whole
generation of graduate students.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.696
We were trying to make blazing fast
computers using nanomaterials.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.336
We were constructing quantum dots

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.736
that could one day go in your body
and find and fight disease.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.776
There were even groups
trying to make an elevator to space

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.040
using carbon nanotubes.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
You can look that up, that's true.

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:20.776
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.896
all parts of science and technology,
from computing to medicine.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.176
And I have to admit,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.176
I drank all of the Kool-Aid.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.840
I mean, every last drop.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.320
But that was 15 years ago,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.376
and --

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.776
fantastic science was done,
really important work.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.056
We've learned a lot.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.456
We were never able to translate
that science into new technologies --

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.256
into technologies
that could actually impact people.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.496
And the reason is, these nanomaterials --

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.176
they're like a double-edged sword.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.456
The same thing that makes
them so interesting --

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.776
their small size --

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.096
also makes them impossible to work with.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.856
It's literally like trying to build
a statue out of a pile of dust.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.576
And we just don't have the tools
that are small enough to work with them.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.896
But even if we did,
it wouldn't really matter,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.816
because we couldn't one by one
place millions of particles together

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.200
to build a technology.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.976
So because of that,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.096
all of the promise
and all of the excitement

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.896
has remained just that:
promise and excitement.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.296
We don't have any
disease-fighting nanobots,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.376
there's no elevators to space,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.096
and the thing that I'm most interested in,
no new types of computing.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.656
Now that last one,
that's a really important one.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.016
We just have come to expect

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.816
the pace of computing advancements
to go on indefinitely.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.416
We've built entire economies on this idea.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.176
And this pace exists

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.656
because of our ability
to pack more and more devices

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.376
onto a computer chip.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.216
And as those devices get smaller,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.496
they get faster, they consume less power

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.936
and they get cheaper.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.536
And it's this convergence
that gives us this incredible pace.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.776
As an example:

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.216
if I took the room-sized computer
that sent three men to the moon and back

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.376
and somehow compressed it --

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.656
compressed the world's
greatest computer of its day,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.256
so it was the same size
as your smartphone --

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.536
your actual smartphone,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.936
that thing you spent 300 bucks on
and just toss out every two years,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.416
would blow this thing away.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.776
You would not be impressed.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.296
It couldn't do anything
that your smartphone does.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.816
It would be slow,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.016
you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.496
you could possibly
get through the first two minutes

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.696
of a "Walking Dead" episode
if you're lucky --

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.736
(Laughter)

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.935
The point is the progress --
it's not gradual.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.656
The progress is relentless.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.935
It's exponential.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.296
It compounds on itself year after year,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.496
to the point where
if you compare a technology

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.216
from one generation to the next,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.216
they're almost unrecognizable.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.856
And we owe it to ourselves
to keep this progress going.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.496
We want to say the same thing
10, 20, 30 years from now:

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.600
look what we've done
over the last 30 years.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.936
Yet we know this progress
may not last forever.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.016
In fact, the party's kind of winding down.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.376
It's like "last call for alcohol," right?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.056
If you look under the covers,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.656
by many metrics
like speed and performance,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.200
the progress has already slowed to a halt.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.896
So if we want to keep this party going,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.176
we have to do what we've
always been able to do,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.656
and that is to innovate.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.256
So our group's role
and our group's mission

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.696
is to innovate
by employing carbon nanotubes,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.776
because we think that they can
provide a path to continue this pace.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.256
They are just like they sound.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.736
They're tiny, hollow tubes
of carbon atoms,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.696
and their nanoscale size,
that small size,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.376
gives rise to these
just outstanding electronic properties.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.056
And the science tells us
if we could employ them in computing,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.816
we could see up to a ten times
improvement in performance.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.240
It's like skipping through several
technology generations in just one step.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.096
So there we have it.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.136
We have this really important problem

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.536
and we have what is basically
the ideal solution.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.216
The science is screaming at us,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.080
"This is what you should be doing
to solve your problem."

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.096
So, all right, let's get started,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.376
let's do this.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.096
But you just run right back
into that double-edged sword.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.696
This "ideal solution" contains a material
that's impossible to work with.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.016
I'd have to arrange billions of them
just to make one single computer chip.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.640
It's that same conundrum,
it's like this undying problem.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.336
At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.296
Let's not go down that same road.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.856
Let's just figure out what's missing.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.296
What are we not dealing with?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.456
What are we not doing
that needs to be done?"

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.256
It's like in "The Godfather," right?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.576
When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.256
we all know what needs to be done.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.616
Fredo's got to go.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.656
(Laughter)

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.616
But Michael -- he puts it off.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.856
Fine, I get it.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.336
Their mother's still alive,
it would make her upset.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.776
We just said,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.096
"What's the Fredo in our problem?"

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.536
What are we not dealing with?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.096
What are we not doing,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.640
but needs to be done
to make this a success?"

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.256
And the answer is
that the statue has to build itself.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.216
We have to find a way, somehow,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.336
to compel, to convince
billions of these particles

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.336
to assemble themselves
into the technology.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.536
We can't do it for them.
They have to do it for themselves.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.696
And it's the hard way,
and this is not trivial,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.576
but in this case, it's the only way.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.496
Now, as it turns out,
this is not that alien of a problem.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.376
We just don't build anything this way.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.416
People don't build anything this way.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.616
But if you look around --
and there's examples everywhere --

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.536
Mother Nature builds everything this way.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.216
Everything is built from the bottom up.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.496
You can go to the beach,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.696
you'll find these simple organisms
that use proteins --

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.976
basically molecules --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.056
to template what is essentially sand,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.496
just plucking it from the sea

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.896
and building these extraordinary
architectures with extreme diversity.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.536
And nature's not crude like us,
just hacking away.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.256
She's elegant and smart,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.016
building with what's available,
molecule by molecule,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.176
making structures with a complexity

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.480
and a diversity
that we can't even approach.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.016
And she's already at the nano.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.536
She's been there
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.600
We're the ones that are late to the party.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.296
So we decided that we're going
to use the same tool that nature uses,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.560
and that's chemistry.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.456
Chemistry is the missing tool.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.536
And chemistry works in this case

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.376
because these nanoscale objects
are about the same size as molecules,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.016
so we can use them
to steer these objects around,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.240
much like a tool.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.816
That's exactly what we've done in our lab.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.016
We've developed chemistry
that goes into the pile of dust,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.536
into the pile of nanoparticles,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.936
and pulls out exactly the ones we need.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.576
Then we can use chemistry to arrange
literally billions of these particles

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.456
into the pattern
we need to build circuits.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.816
And because we can do that,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.216
we can build circuits
that are many times faster

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.456
than what anyone's been able
to make using nanomaterials before.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.896
Chemistry's the missing tool,

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.536
and every day our tool gets sharper
and gets more precise.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.776
And eventually --

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.416
and we hope this is
within a handful of years --

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.816
we can deliver on one
of those original promises.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.895
Now, computing is just one example.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:54.456
It's the one that I'm interested in,
that my group is really invested in,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.296
but there are others
in renewable energy, in medicine,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.056
in structural materials,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.136
where the science is going to tell you
to move towards the nano.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.280
That's where the biggest benefit is.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.376
But if we're going to do that,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.576
the scientists of today and tomorrow
are going to need new tools --

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.736
tools just like the ones I described.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.616
And they will need chemistry.
That's the point.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.296
The beauty of science is that
once you develop these new tools,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.576
they're out there.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.856
They're out there forever,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.736
and anyone anywhere
can pick them up and use them,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.720
and help to deliver
on the promise of nanotechnology.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.016
Thank you so much for your time.
I appreciate it.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.480
(Applause)
