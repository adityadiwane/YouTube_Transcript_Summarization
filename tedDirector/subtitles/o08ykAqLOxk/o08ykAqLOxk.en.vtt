00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:17.579
Do you think the world is going
to be a better place next year?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.823
In the next decade?

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:23.420
Can we end hunger,

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.975
achieve gender equality,

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.121
halt climate change,

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.708
all in the next 15 years?

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:35.668
Well, according to the governments
of the world, yes we can.

00:00:36.343 --> 00:00:38.961
In the last few days,
the leaders of the world,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:41.461
meeting at the UN in New York,

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:44.240
agreed a new set of Global Goals

00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:47.064
for the development of the world to 2030.

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:48.916
And here they are:

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.172
these goals are the product
of a massive consultation exercise.

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:59.085
The Global Goals are who we,
humanity, want to be.

00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:03.575
Now that's the plan, but can we get there?

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:07.620
Can this vision for a better world
really be achieved?

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:12.007
Well, I'm here today because
we've run the numbers,

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:16.575
and the answer, shockingly,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.043
is that maybe we actually can.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.702
But not with business as usual.

00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:26.812
Now, the idea that the world
is going to get a better place

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.741
may seem a little fanciful.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.575
Watch the news every day and the world
seems to be going backwards, not forwards.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.297
And let's be frank:

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:38.575
it's pretty easy to be skeptical
about grand announcements

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.018
coming out of the UN.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:45.162
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:47.853
Because back in 2001,

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:52.397
the UN agreed another set of goals,
the Millennium Development Goals.

00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:57.338
And the flagship target there
was to halve the proportion of people

00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:00.313
living in poverty by 2015.

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:04.889
The target was to take
from a baseline of 1990,

00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:08.575
when 36 percent of the world's
population lived in poverty,

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.792
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.575
Did we hit this target?

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.050
Well, no, we didn't.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.280
We exceeded it.

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:22.860
This year, global poverty
is going to fall to 12 percent.

00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:25.575
Now, that's still not good enough,

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.218
and the world does still have
plenty of problems.

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:34.677
But the pessimists and doomsayers
who say that the world can't get better

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.010
are simply wrong.

00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:39.575
So how did we achieve this success?

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.740
Well, a lot of it was because
of economic growth.

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:48.575
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
were in countries such as China and India,

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.461
which have seen rapid
economic growth in recent years.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:55.575
So can we pull off the same trick again?

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:59.467
Can economic growth
get us to the Global Goals?

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:02.381
Well, to answer that question,

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:06.575
we need to benchmark where the world
is today against the Global Goals

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.173
and figure out how far we have to travel.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:11.949
But that ain't easy,

00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:14.790
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:17.069
they're also pretty complicated.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.743
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.452
and literally hundreds of indicators.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:29.048
Also, while some of the goals
are pretty specific --

00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:30.495
end hunger --

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.415
others are a lot vaguer --

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.041
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.849
So to help us with this benchmarking,

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:41.619
I'm going to use a tool
called the Social Progress Index.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:46.120
What this does is measures all the stuff
the Global Goals are trying to achieve,

00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:50.306
but sums it up into a single number
that we can use as our benchmark

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.479
and track progress over time.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.453
The Social Progress Index basically asks
three fundamental questions

00:03:56.477 --> 00:03:57.738
about a society.

00:03:58.214 --> 00:04:01.679
First of all, does everyone have
the basic needs of survival:

00:04:01.703 --> 00:04:04.511
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:08.289
Secondly, does everyone have
the building blocks of a better life:

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:12.574
education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:16.839
And does everyone have
the opportunity to improve their lives,

00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:20.863
through rights, freedom of choice,
freedom from discrimination,

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:23.590
and access to the world's
most advanced knowledge?

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:28.575
The Social Progress Index sums all this
together using 52 indicators

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.531
to create an aggregate score
on a scale of 0 to 100.

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:36.599
And what we find is that there's
a wide diversity of performance

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:37.784
in the world today.

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.718
The highest performing country,
Norway, scores 88.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.668
The lowest performing country,
Central African Republic, scores 31.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.695
And we can add up
all the countries together,

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.153
weighting for the different
population sizes,

00:04:52.177 --> 00:04:55.575
and that global score is 61.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.311
In concrete terms,

00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:01.093
that means that the average human being
is living on a level of social progress

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:04.539
about the same of Cuba
or Kazakhstan today.

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.785
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.428
What do we have to get to
to achieve the Global Goals?

00:05:12.254 --> 00:05:14.742
Now, the Global Goals
are certainly ambitious,

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:18.800
but they're not about turning the world
into Norway in just 15 years.

00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:23.494
So having looked at the numbers,
my estimate is that a score of 75

00:05:23.518 --> 00:05:27.575
would not only be a giant leap forward
in human well-being,

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.721
it would also count as hitting
the Global Goals target.

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:34.198
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.

00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:36.251
Can we get there?

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:39.259
Well, the Social Progress Index
can help us calculate this,

00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:40.949
because as you might have noticed,

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.198
there are no economic indicators in there;

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:47.699
there's no GDP or economic growth
in the Social Progress Index model.

00:05:48.032 --> 00:05:51.575
And what that lets us do
is understand the relationship

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.883
between economic growth
and social progress.

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.369
Let me show you on this chart.

00:05:57.393 --> 00:06:00.575
So here on the vertical axis,
I've put social progress,

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.167
the stuff the Global Goals
are trying to achieve.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:04.737
Higher is better.

00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.145
And then on the horizontal axis,
is GDP per capita.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.708
Further to the right means richer.

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:14.032
And in there, I'm now going to put
all the countries of the world,

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:16.164
each one represented by a dot,

00:06:16.188 --> 00:06:18.783
and on top of that I'm going to put
the regression line

00:06:18.807 --> 00:06:20.806
that shows the average relationship.

00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:24.691
And what this tells us
is that as we get richer,

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:27.223
social progress does tend to improve.

00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:32.663
However, as we get richer,
each extra dollar of GDP

00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:36.284
is buying us less and less
social progress.

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:40.848
And now we can use this information
to start building our forecast.

00:06:41.403 --> 00:06:44.209
So here is the world in 2015.

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:48.116
We have a social progress score of 61

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.324
and a GDP per capita of $14,000.

00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:56.123
And the place we're trying to get to,
remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.

00:06:56.147 --> 00:06:59.805
So here we are today,
$14,000 per capita GDP.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.655
How rich are we going to be in 2030?

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.517
That's what we need to know next.

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.792
Well, the best forecast we can find comes
from the US Department of Agriculture,

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:13.467
which forecasts 3.1 percent
average global economic growth

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.235
over the next 15 years,

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.378
which means that in 2030,
if they're right,

00:07:18.402 --> 00:07:22.428
per capita GDP will be about $23,000.

00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:25.834
So now the question is:
if we get that much richer,

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.159
how much social progress
are we going to get?

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:31.357
Well, we asked a team
of economists at Deloitte

00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:33.150
who checked and crunched the numbers,

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:38.126
and they came back and said, well, look:
if the world's average wealth goes

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.926
from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.238
social progress is going to increase

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:48.625
from 61 to 62.4.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.839
(Laughter)

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:55.362
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.862
Now this seems a bit strange.

00:07:57.886 --> 00:08:00.098
Economic growth seems
to have really helped

00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:01.811
in the fight against poverty,

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.035
but it doesn't seem
to be having much impact

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:06.142
on trying to get to the Global Goals.

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:07.761
So what's going on?

00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:09.873
Well, I think there are two things.

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:13.764
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.

00:08:13.788 --> 00:08:16.780
We've used up the easy wins
from economic growth,

00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:19.152
and now we're moving on
to harder problems.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.038
And also, we know that economic growth
comes with costs as well as benefits.

00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:28.586
There are costs to the environment, costs
from new health problems like obesity.

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:31.110
So that's the bad news.

00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:35.441
We're not going to get to the Global Goals
just by getting richer.

00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.033
So are the pessimists right?

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:39.941
Well, maybe not.

00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:43.868
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.

00:08:44.683 --> 00:08:47.042
Let me take you back
to that regression line.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:50.446
So this is the average relationship
between GDP and social progress,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.356
and this is what our
last forecast was based on.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.713
But as you saw already,

00:08:55.737 --> 00:08:59.662
there is actually lots of noise
around this trend line.

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:02.908
What that tells us, quite simply,

00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:06.035
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:09.067
We have countries that are underperforming

00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.740
on social progress,
relative to their wealth.

00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:14.671
Russia has lots
of natural resource wealth,

00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:16.847
but lots of social problems.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:19.102
China has boomed economically,

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:23.329
but hasn't made much headway
on human rights or environmental issues.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.574
India has a space program
and millions of people without toilets.

00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:32.561
Now, on the other hand, we have countries
that are overperforming

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.575
on social progress relative to their GDP.

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:41.633
Costa Rica has prioritized education,
health and environmental sustainability,

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:45.578
and as a result, it's achieving
a very high level of social progress,

00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:48.852
despite only having a rather modest GDP.

00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:51.575
And Costa Rica's not alone.

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:55.575
From poor countries like Rwanda
to richer countries like New Zealand,

00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:59.197
we see that it's possible to get
lots of social progress,

00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:01.824
even if your GDP is not so great.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:05.903
And that's really important,
because it tells us two things.

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:11.492
First of all, it tells us that we already
in the world have the solutions

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:15.344
to many of the problems
that the Global Goals are trying to solve.

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:19.601
It also tells us
that we're not slaves to GDP.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:24.304
Our choices matter: if we prioritize
the well-being of people,

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:28.204
then we can make a lot more progress
than our GDP might expect.

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:32.160
How much? Enough to get us
to the Global Goals?

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:33.795
Well, let's look at some numbers.

00:10:33.819 --> 00:10:37.680
What we know already: the world today
is scoring 61 on social progress,

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.502
and the place we want to get to is 75.

00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:42.746
If we rely on economic growth alone,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.351
we're going to get to 62.4.

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:49.477
So let's assume now that we can get
the countries that are currently

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.695
underperforming on social progress --
the Russia, China, Indias --

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.019
just up to the average.

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:56.599
How much social progress does that get us?

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.734
Well, that takes us to 65.

00:10:59.297 --> 00:11:02.203
It's a bit better, but still
quite a long way to go.

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:04.588
So let's get a little bit more
optimistic and say,

00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.402
what if every country
gets a little bit better

00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:09.813
at turning its wealth into well-being?

00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:12.591
Well then, we get to 67.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.095
And now let's be even bolder still.

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:20.575
What if every country in the world
chose to be like Costa Rica

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.969
in prioritizing human well-being,

00:11:22.993 --> 00:11:25.575
using its wealth for the well-being
of its citizens?

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:29.818
Well then, we get to nearly 73,
very close to the Global Goals.

00:11:30.599 --> 00:11:32.575
Can we achieve the Global Goals?

00:11:32.599 --> 00:11:34.801
Certainly not with business as usual.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:39.629
Even a flood tide of economic growth
is not going to get us there,

00:11:39.653 --> 00:11:42.716
if it just raises the mega-yachts
and the super-wealthy

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.534
and leaves the rest behind.

00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:49.171
If we're going to achieve the Global Goals
we have to do things differently.

00:11:49.195 --> 00:11:53.404
We have to prioritize social progress,
and really scale solutions

00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:54.918
around the world.

00:11:54.942 --> 00:11:58.657
I believe the Global Goals
are a historic opportunity,

00:11:58.681 --> 00:12:02.276
because the world's leaders
have promised to deliver them.

00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:07.074
Let's not dismiss the goals
or slide into pessimism;

00:12:07.098 --> 00:12:09.090
let's hold them to that promise.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:13.159
And we need to hold them to that promise
by holding them accountable,

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:16.474
tracking their progress all the way
through the next 15 years.

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:18.610
And I want to finish by showing you

00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:21.399
a way to do that, called
the People's Report Card.

00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:26.330
The People's Report Card brings together
all this data into a simple framework

00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:28.894
that we'll all be familiar
with from our school days,

00:12:28.918 --> 00:12:30.346
to hold them to account.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.625
It grades our performance
on the Global Goals

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:36.120
on a scale from F to A,

00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:41.237
where F is humanity at its worst,
and A is humanity at its best.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.461
Our world today is scoring a C-.

00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:50.834
The Global Goals are all about
getting to an A,

00:12:50.858 --> 00:12:54.575
and that's why we're going to be updating
the People's Report Card annually,

00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:57.812
for the world and for all
the countries of the world,

00:12:57.836 --> 00:13:00.427
so we can hold our leaders to account

00:13:00.451 --> 00:13:04.593
to achieve this target
and fulfill this promise.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.827
Because getting to the Global Goals will
only happen if we do things differently,

00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.018
if our leaders do things differently,

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.939
and for that to happen,
that needs us to demand it.

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:19.971
So let's reject business as usual.

00:13:20.455 --> 00:13:22.913
Let's demand a different path.

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:27.183
Let's choose the world that we want.

00:13:28.157 --> 00:13:29.309
Thank you.

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:34.575
(Applause)

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:36.476
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.

00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:41.498
Michael, just one question:
the Millennium Development Goals

00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:43.003
established 15 years ago,

00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:46.104
they were kind of applying
to every country

00:13:46.128 --> 00:13:49.695
but it turned out to be really
a scorecard for emerging countries.

00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:52.171
Now the new Global Goals
are explicitly universal.

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:56.347
They ask for every country to show action
and to show progress.

00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:59.359
How can I, as a private citizen,
use the report card

00:13:59.383 --> 00:14:02.217
to create pressure for action?

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:06.116
Michael Green: This is a really important
point; it's a big shift in priorities --

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.619
it's no longer about poor
countries and just poverty.

00:14:08.643 --> 00:14:09.858
It's about every country.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:13.512
And every country is going to have
challenges in getting to the Global Goals.

00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:16.846
Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,
Switzerland has got to work to do.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.240
And so that's why we're going to produce
these report cards in 2016

00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:21.750
for every country in the world.

00:14:21.774 --> 00:14:23.853
Then we can really see, how are we doing?

00:14:23.877 --> 00:14:26.758
And it's not going to be rich countries
scoring straight A's.

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:29.390
And that, then, I think,
is to provide a point of focus

00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:32.870
for people to start demanding action
and start demanding progress.

00:14:32.894 --> 00:14:34.342
BG: Thank you very much.

00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:37.599
(Applause)
