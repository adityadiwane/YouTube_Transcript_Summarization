00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.975
The school of architecture
that I studied at some 30 years ago

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.838
happened to be across the street
from the wonderful art gallery

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:24.050
designed by the great
architect Louis Kahn.

00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:28.690
I love the building,
and I used to visit it quite often.

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:30.245
One day,

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.364
I saw the security guard run his hand
across the concrete wall.

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:38.584
And it was the way he did it,

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:40.342
the expression on his face --

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:43.877
something touched me.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.426
I could see that the security guard
was moved by the building

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.649
and that architecture has that capacity

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:54.835
to move you.

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:57.776
I could see it, and I remember thinking,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.025
"Wow. How does architecture do that?"

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:07.351
At school, I was learning to design,

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:10.437
but here -- here was
a reaction of the heart.

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:15.063
And it touched me to the core.

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.796
You know, you aspire for beauty,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.242
for sensuousness, for atmosphere,
the emotional response.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.082
That's the realm of the ineffable

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:33.877
and the immeasurable.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.043
And that's what you live for:

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.427
a chance to try.

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:43.155
So in 2003, there was
an open call for designs

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.301
for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:48.323
This was the first temple
in all of South America.

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:50.231
It's a continental temple,

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.434
a hugely important milestone
for the Bahá'í community,

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:57.690
because this would be the last
of the continental temples

00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:01.270
and would open the door
for national and local temples to be built

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:02.619
around the world.

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:06.193
And the brief was deceptively simple

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.866
and unique in the annals of religion:

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:15.864
a circular room, nine sides,
nine entrances, nine paths,

00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:23.338
allowing you to come to the temple
from all directions,

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:26.296
nine symbolizing completeness,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.560
perfection.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:31.860
No pulpit, no sermons,

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.220
as there are no clergy
in the Bahá'í faith.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.935
And in a world which is putting up walls,

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.407
the design needed to express in form

00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:43.716
the very opposite.

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.847
It had to be open, welcoming

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:53.415
to people of all faiths,
walks of life, backgrounds,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.424
or no faith at all;

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:59.452
a new form of sacred space

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:01.490
with no pattern

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.998
or models to draw from.

00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:10.006
It was like designing one of the first
churches for Christianity

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.712
or one of the first mosques for Islam.

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.455
So we live in a secular world.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:25.442
How do you design sacred space today?

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:30.659
And how do you even define
what's sacred today?

00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:37.797
I stumbled across this beautiful quote
from the Bahá'í writings,

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.629
and it speaks to prayer.

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.361
It says that if you reach out in prayer,

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.495
and if your prayer is answered --
which is already very interesting --

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.949
that the pillars of your heart
will become ashine.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.816
And I loved this idea
of the inner and the outer,

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:03.118
like when you see someone
and you say, "That person is radiant."

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:09.031
And I was thinking, "My gosh,
how could we make something

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:11.118
architectural out of that,

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:15.347
where you create a building

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.159
and it becomes alive with light?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.360
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,
it becomes alive.

00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:25.526
And I drew this sketch,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.911
something with two layers, translucent

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.692
with structure in between capturing light.

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:38.427
Maybe a pure form,
a single form of emanation

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:40.872
that you could imagine

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:44.400
would be all dome

00:04:44.424 --> 00:04:47.895
and everything we kept making
was looking too much like an egg.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.529
(Laughter)

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:50.776
A blob.

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:52.744
So you search.

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.852
You all know this crazy search,
letting the process take you,

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.500
and you live for the surprises.

00:04:59.524 --> 00:05:01.750
And I remember quite by accident

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:07.146
I saw this little video
of a plant moving in light,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.833
and it made me think of movement,

00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:12.029
reach,

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:14.369
this idea that the temple
could have reach,

00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:16.165
like this reach for the divine.

00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.052
You can imagine also

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:23.971
that movement within a circle
could mean movement and stillness,

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:25.986
like the cosmos,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.654
something you see in many places.

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:32.107
(Laughter)

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.446
But rotation was not enough,

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:38.852
because we needed a form.

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:41.142
In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:46.028
the temples being as perfect
as is humanly possible,

00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:48.629
and we kept thinking,
well, what is perfection?

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:52.997
And I remember I stumbled into this image
of this Japanese basket

00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:57.022
and thinking our Western notions
of perfection need to be challenged,

00:05:57.046 --> 00:06:01.769
that this wonderful silhouette
of this basket, this wonkiness,

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:07.441
and that it has the kind of dimple
of what you might imagine a shoulder

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:08.972
or the cheekbone,

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:11.129
and that kind of organic form.

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:14.686
And so we drew and made models,

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.925
these lines that merge at the top,

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.287
soft lines,

00:06:20.307 --> 00:06:23.248
which became like drapery

00:06:23.272 --> 00:06:26.769
and translucent veils and folding,

00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:30.883
and the idea of not only
folding but torquing --

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:33.911
you remember the plant
and the way it was reaching.

00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:38.376
And this started to become
an interesting form,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.087
carving the base, making the entrances.

00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:43.919
And then we ended up with this.

00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:47.540
This is this temple with two layers,

00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:50.057
nine luminous veils,

00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:51.556
embodied light,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.527
soft-flowing lines

00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:55.714
like luminescent drapery.

00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:59.807
180 submissions
were received from 80 countries,

00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:01.838
and this was selected.

00:07:01.862 --> 00:07:07.049
So we went to the next stage
of how to build it.

00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.705
We had submitted alabaster.

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:14.465
But alabaster was too soft,

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.965
and we were experimenting,
many experiments with materials,

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:21.355
trying to think how we could have
this kind of shimmer,

00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:25.436
and we ended up with borosilicate.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.036
And borosilicate glass,
as you know, is very strong,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.286
and if you break borosilicate rods
just so and melt them

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.614
at just the right temperature,

00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:38.406
we ended up with this new material,

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.644
this new cast glass which took us
about two years to make.

00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:45.881
And it had this quality that we loved,

00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:47.944
this idea of the embodied light,

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:53.306
but on the inside, we wanted
something with a soft light,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.941
like the inner lining of a jacket.

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:59.863
On the outside you have protection,
but on the inside you touch it.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:06.440
So we found this tiny vein
in a huge quarry in Portugal

00:08:06.464 --> 00:08:09.747
with this beautiful stone,

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:14.781
which the owner had kept
for seven generations in his family,

00:08:14.805 --> 00:08:17.666
waiting for the right project,
if you can believe it.

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:21.789
Look at this material, it's beautiful.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:25.151
And the way it lights up;
it has that translucent quality.

00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:28.436
So here you see the structure.

00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:30.573
It lets the light through.

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:34.991
And looking down,

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.287
the nine wings are bound,

00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.851
structurally but symbolically strong,

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:43.250
a great symbol of unity:

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:47.446
pure geometry, a perfect circle,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.856
30 meters in section and in plan,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.660
perfectly symmetrical,

00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:56.661
like the idea of sacredness and geometry.

00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:00.968
And here you see the building going up,

00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:03.279
2,000 steel nodes,

00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:06.326
9,000 pieces of steel,

00:09:07.017 --> 00:09:09.805
7,800 stone pieces,

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:14.361
10,000 cast glass pieces,
all individual shapes,

00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:17.418
the entire superstructure all described,

00:09:17.442 --> 00:09:21.933
engineered, fabricated
with aerospace technology,

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:25.144
prefabricated machine to machine,

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.032
robotically,

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:29.333
a huge team effort, you can imagine,

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:31.301
of literally hundreds,

00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:36.053
and within three percent
of our $30 million budget

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.360
set in 2006.

00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:40.031
(Applause)

00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:46.993
Nine wings bound together

00:09:47.017 --> 00:09:49.188
forming a nine-pointed star,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.390
and the star shape moving in space,

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:56.665
tracking the sun.

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.022
So here it is.

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.819
Audience: Wow!

00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:16.943
(Applause)

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:24.222
Hopefully, a befitting response
to that beautiful quote,

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:27.342
"a prayer answered,"

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:29.696
open in all directions,

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:32.986
capturing the blue light of dawn,

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:37.736
tent-like white light of day,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.678
the gold light of the afternoon,

00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:43.484
and of course, at night, the reversal:

00:10:45.302 --> 00:10:46.620
sensuous,

00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:51.664
catching the light in all kinds
of mysterious ways.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:59.014
And the site: it's interesting;
14 years ago when we made the submission,

00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:01.148
we showed the temple
set against the Andes.

00:11:01.172 --> 00:11:03.882
We didn't have the Andes as our site,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:08.561
but after nine years, that's exactly
where we ended up,

00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:13.811
the lines of the temple set against
nothing but pure nature,

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:18.974
and you turn around and you get
nothing but the city below you,

00:11:18.998 --> 00:11:23.686
and inside, a view in all directions,

00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:27.556
radiating gardens

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.523
from each of the alcoves,

00:11:31.277 --> 00:11:32.851
radiating paths.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.564
Last October, the opening ceremonies --

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.671
a beautiful, sacred event,

00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:47.478
5,000 people from 80 countries,

00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:51.415
a continuous river of visitors,

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:54.909
indigenous people
from all over South America,

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:57.548
some who had never left their villages.

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:03.601
And of course, that this temple
belongs to people,

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:09.060
the collective, of many cultures
and walks of life,

00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:10.500
many beliefs,

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:15.137
and for me, what's most important
is what it feels like on the inside;

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:17.987
that it feel intimate,

00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:19.766
sacred,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.170
and that everyone is welcome.

00:12:22.194 --> 00:12:26.813
And if even a few who come

00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:30.550
have the same reaction
as that security guard,

00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:36.094
then it truly would be their temple.
