00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
It was the early '90s,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and I was at a public event.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I saw this leaflet and it said,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
"There are millions of slaves in the world today."

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And I thought, "No way, no way."

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And I'm going to admit to hubris.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Because I also, I'm going to admit to you,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I also thought, "How can I be like

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
a hot-shot young full professor

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
who teaches human rights and not know this?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
So it can't be true."

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Well, if you teach, if you worship

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
in the temple of learning,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
do not mock the gods,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
because they will take you,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
fill you with curiosity and desire,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and drive you. Drive you with a passion

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
to change things.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I went out and did a lit review,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
All the rest were historical.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
no solid information.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
So, I began to do a research project of my own.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I went to five countries around the world.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and I looked very deeply

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
into slave-based businesses

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
because this is an economic crime.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
People do not enslave people to be mean to them.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
They do it to make a profit.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in four different continents,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
was depressingly familiar.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Like this:

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Agricultural workers in Africa,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
whipped and beaten,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
showing us how they were beaten in the fields

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
before they escaped from slavery

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and met up with our film crew.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It was mind-blowing.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And I want to be very clear.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I'm talking about real slavery.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
This is not about lousy marriages,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
this is not about jobs that suck.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
This is about people who can not walk away,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
people who are forced to work without pay,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
people who are operating 24/7

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
under a threat of violence

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and have no pay.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
It's real slavery in exactly the same way

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that slavery would be recognized

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
throughout all of human history.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Now, where is it?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
are the places with the highest densities of slavery.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
But in fact that kind of bluey color

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
where we can't find any cases of enslavement

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
around the world.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
We're also particularly interested

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and looking very carefully

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
at places where

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
slaves are being used to perpetrate

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
extreme environmental destruction.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
forest areas in West Africa;

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
mining and spreading mercury around

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
in places like Ghana and the Congo;

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.260
destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
It's a pretty harrowing linkage

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
between what's happening to our environment

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and what's happening to our human rights.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
where we have 27 million people

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in slavery in the year 2010?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
That's double the number that came out of Africa

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in the entire transatlantic slave trade.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Well, it builds up with these factors.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
One we all know about, the population explosion:

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
the world goes from two billion people to almost

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
seven billion people in the last 50 years.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Being numerous does not make you a slave.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
in the developing world,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We understand how that works. In some countries

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
all of those things happen at once,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
like Sierra Leone a few years ago,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
as we know, live on the edge,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
live in situations where

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.260
they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
But that doesn't make you a slave either.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.260
into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
If the rule of law is sound, it protects

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
the poor and it protects the vulnerable.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But if corruption creeps in

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and people don't have the opportunity

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to have that protection of the rule of law,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
then if you can use violence,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
if you can use violence with impunity,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
into slavery.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Though, for a lot of people,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the people who step

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
into slavery today

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.260
don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
They come into slavery because

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
someone has asked them this question.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
All around the world I've been told an almost identical story.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
People say, "I was home,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
someone came into our village,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
who needs a job?'"

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And they did exactly what

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
you or I would do in the same situation.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
but my children were hungry.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
We needed medicine.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I knew I had to do anything I could

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
to earn some money to support the people I care about."

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
They take it for a little while,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and they discover they're enslaved.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Now, that kind of slavery

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and novel about slavery today,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and that is a complete collapse

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in the price of human beings --

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
expensive in the past, dirt cheap now.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Even the business programs have started

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
picking up on this.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
I just want to share a little clip for you.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
as we get macro and talk commodities.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And we're also joined by Brent Lawson

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
from Lawson Frisk Securities.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
D: Good to have you with us, Brent.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and casting our net just a little bit wider.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We really like the human being story a lot.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
If you look at a long-term chart,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
prices are at historical lows and yet global demand

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
for forced labor is still real strong.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.260
So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
as an asset is the endless supply.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
That is that private equity has been sniffing around,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and that tells me that this market is about to explode.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Africans and Indians, as usual,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
are on our buy list.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
MO: We're recommending to our clients

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
a buy and hold strategy.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
There's no need to play the market.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Though I enjoyed watching

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and they've been slipping it in between music videos

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Here's the reality.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Capital purchase items.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
The average price of a human being today,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
around the world, is about 90 dollars.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
They are more expensive in places like North America.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
but I could take you places in India or Nepal

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
They key here is that

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
people have ceased to be that capital purchase item

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and become like Styrofoam cups.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
You buy them cheaply, you use them,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
you crumple them up, and then when you're done

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
with them you just throw them away.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
These young boys are in Nepal.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
They are basically the transport system

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
on a quarry run by a slaveholder.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
on their backs, often of their own weight,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
up and down the Himalaya Mountains.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
One of their mothers said to us,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
"You know, we can't survive here,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
but we can't even seem to die either."

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
It's a horrible situation.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
it's that there are also --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.260
there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
I don't know if you've ever had a daydream

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
about, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
is that I get to,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and I want to introduce you to one of those.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
enslaved in the fishing industry,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and he now, after escape and building a new life,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
has formed an organization that we work closely with

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
to go back and get people out of slavery.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
in the head. And this reminds me

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
of my childhood when I used to work here.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.260
KB: James and our country director in Ghana,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
because the two of them managed to get

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
for the very first time in Ghana

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
for enslaving people, from the fishing industry,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
for enslaving children.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Now, everything I've been telling you,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
I admit, is pretty disheartening.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.260
But there is actually a very positive side to this,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and that is this: The 27 million people

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
who are in slavery today,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
that's a lot of people, but it's also

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
the smallest fraction

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
of the global population to ever be in slavery.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
into the global economy each year

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
is the tiniest proportion of the global economy

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.260
to ever be represented by slave labor.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Slavery, illegal in every country

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.260
has been pushed to the edges of our global society.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And in a way, without us even noticing,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
has ended up standing on the precipice

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
of its own extinction,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
waiting for us to give it a big boot

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and knock it over. And get rid of it.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
And it can be done.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and the focus to it,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
I've got to be absolutely clear.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
We do not buy people out of slavery.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Buying people out of slavery is like

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
paying a burglar to get your television back;

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
it's abetting a crime.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Liberation, however, costs some money.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Liberation, and more importantly

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
all the work that comes after liberation.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
It's not an event, it's a process.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
It's about helping people to build lives of dignity,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
stability, economic autonomy,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
citizenship.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Well, amazingly,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
in places like India where costs are very low,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.260
that family, that three-generation family that you see there

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
who were in hereditary slavery --

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.260
so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery --

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
but the total cost, amortized

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
across the rest of the work,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
was about 150 dollars to bring that family

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
out of slavery and then take them through a two year process

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.260
to build a stable life of citizenship and education.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
In the United States, North America,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
we understand that it's expensive here:

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
about 30,000 dollars.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But most of the people in the world in slavery

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
live in those places where

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
the costs are lowest.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And in fact, the global average is about what it is

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
for Ghana.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
And that means, when you multiply it up,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
the estimated cost of

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
not just freedom but sustainable freedom

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.260
for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
is something like 10.8 billion dollars --

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260
usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
or in the last holiday period

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.260
when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
we spent 10.8 billion dollars.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
It's not a lot of money at the global level.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
In fact, it's peanuts.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And the great thing about it is that

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it's not money down a hole,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
to work for themselves,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
are they motivated?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
They take their kids out of the workplace,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
they build a school, they say,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
medicine when we're sick,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
clothing when we're cold."

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
They become consumers and producers

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
That's important, all of that

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
about how we rebuild sustainable freedom,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.260
because we'd never want to repeat

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
what happened in this country in 1865.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Four million people were lifted up out of slavery

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and then dumped.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Dumped without political participation,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
decent education,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
any kind of real opportunity

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
in terms of economic lives,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
and then sentenced to generations of

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
violence and prejudice and discrimination.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And America is still paying the price

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.260
for the botched emancipation of 1865.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
We have made a commitment

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
that we will never let people

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
come out of slavery on our watch,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and end up as second class citizens.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
It's just not going to happen.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
This is what liberation really looks like.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
reunited with their parents,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and then taken with their parents back to their villages

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
to rebuild their economic well-being

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
so that they become slave-proof --

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
absolutely unenslaveable.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Now, this woman

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
lived in a village in Nepal.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
We'd been working there about a month.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.260
They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
They'd just begun to light up a little bit,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
open up a little bit.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:07.260
the slaveholders were still menacing us

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
I was frightened. We were frightened.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
We said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.260
She said, "No, because we've got hope now.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.260
How could we not succeed," she said,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.260
"when people like you from the other side of the world

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
are coming here to stand beside us?"

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Okay, we have to ask ourselves,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.260
are we willing to live in a world with slavery?

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to have someone else jerk the strings

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
that tie us to slavery in the products we buy,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and in our government policies.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.260
I think it's that slavery should end.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
And if there is a fundamental violation

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
of our human dignity

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
that we would all say is horrific,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
it's slavery.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
And we've got to say,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
what good is all of our intellectual

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
and political and economic power --

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room --

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
I think there is enough intellectual power in this room

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
to bring slavery to an end.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
And you know what? If we can't do that,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
there is one last question:

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Are we truly free?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
Okay, thank you so much.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:55.260
(Applause)
