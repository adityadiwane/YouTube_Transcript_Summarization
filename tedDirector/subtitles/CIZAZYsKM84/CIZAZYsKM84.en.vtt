00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'd like to speak about technology trends,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is something that many of you follow --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but we also follow, for related reasons.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are something that we write about and need to know about.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We have to plan issues many months in advance;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that's based on technology trends.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And so we have to understand

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
not only why tech's important, where it's going,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You've probably seen something like this before.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or whether they were about to crash

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
into the trough of disillusionment,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's based on the presumption, the observation even,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
a collision with something else --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And these are the inflection points that tell you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and maybe how you can do something about it.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The first is the critical price.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The first stage in a technology's advance

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is that it'll fall below a critical price.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and that's another important point.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it's an opportunity for the technology to change.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
there's still more opportunity in that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
by telling the story of the DVD,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
which is a technology which has done all of these.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And what's interesting here

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you've got high-quality digital video;

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
you have a reason to have a big-screen television;

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and bring the rest of your entertainment in.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that was an inflection point that he could do something with.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The next phase it hit was displacement.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
That gave an advantage; that was an implication

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You're aware of the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
over the 30-dollar DVD.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But they're getting very, very cheap,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
They're being commodified, and that's what happens

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
(Laughter)

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
these four stages of technology's life.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
these four, as a way to kind of tell you

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
where each one of those technologies is in its development.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
they're just examples of technologies

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that are in each one of these periods.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But I think that the implications of them approaching

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Start with gene sequencing.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
because it's built on computers -- is falling in price

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It is now possible -- will be possible,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
he may tell you something about this --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
is getting closer and closer.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that we're discovering is rising very quickly.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There will come a day

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
if you look at the correlation between these two,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
two million in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Linux is another good example.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Now we've switched to critical mass.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but not the crossovers that matter.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It's not just for the geeks any more.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
they'll be two percent of auto sales.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
you can have replaceable body shapes --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
it's a little hard to use right now.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they already have nearly four million registered users --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that's critical mass.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
telecom standards. This is a tipping point --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and the speed, and the players in the industry.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's going to look a little bit like that.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Free is something that comes with digital, because

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
because there's so much bandwidth.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Free is probably the most interesting thing.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And here you have just the number of songs

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that can be stored on a hard drive.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the physical element, of songs off the table.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And you've seen the numbers.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the one that's going to get them out of this.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
their abundance tends to make things free.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
when it was more than two dollars a minute.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
but then there was just so much fiber out there,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and one of the most powerful economic tools

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that we're seeing in our world today.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
The force of India, and then China, and any other country

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that can contact our markets

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
is just beginning to be felt.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And I think that's probably one

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Thank you.
