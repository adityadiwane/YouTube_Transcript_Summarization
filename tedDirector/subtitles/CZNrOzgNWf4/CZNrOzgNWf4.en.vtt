00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.538
I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.932
and following my training,

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:22.854
I moved to Somalia

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:24.898
from San Francisco.

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:26.513
And my goodbye greeting

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:28.366
from the chief of infectious diseases

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.462
at San Francisco General was,

00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:34.145
"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:38.193
But I landed in a refugee situation

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:42.266
that had a million refugees in 40 camps,

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.793
and there were six of us doctors.

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:47.109
There were many epidemics there.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.722
My responsibilities were largely related to

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:51.463
tuberculosis,

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:55.329
and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.392
So it was the spread of tuberculosis

00:00:57.392 --> 00:00:59.439
and the spread of cholera

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:04.640
that I was responsible for inhibiting.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.281
And in order to do this work, we, of course,

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.981
because of the limitation in health workers,

00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.747
had to recruit refugees to be a specialized

00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:16.506
new category of health worker.

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:19.734
Following three years of work in Somalia,

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:22.344
I got picked up by the World Health Organization,

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:25.391
and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:28.264
My primary responsibility was Uganda,

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:31.267
but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:34.354
and Zaire, now Congo,

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:37.922
Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:40.383
And my last assignment there was to run a unit

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:42.268
called intervention development,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.984
which was responsible for designing interventions.

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:48.959
After 10 years of working overseas,

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.682
I was exhausted.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:52.880
I really had very little left.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.292
I had been traveling to one country after another.

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:00.756
I was emotionally feeling very isolated.

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.894
I wanted to come home.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:04.930
I'd seen a lot of death,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.880
in particular epidemic death,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.828
and epidemic death has a different feel to it.

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:14.436
It's full of panic and fear,

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:18.232
and I'd heard the women wailing and crying

00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:20.540
in the desert.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.933
And I wanted to come home and take a break

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.972
and maybe start over.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.824
I was not aware of any epidemic problems

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:30.461
in America.

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.748
In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:35.828
In fact -- seriously.

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:38.670
And in fact I would visit friends of mine,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.759
and I noticed that they had water

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.772
that came right into their homes.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:45.647
How many of you have such a situation?

00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:46.815
(Laughter)

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:49.426
And some of them, many of them actually,

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.541
had water that came into more than one room.

00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:54.788
And I noticed that they would move

00:02:54.788 --> 00:02:56.795
this little thermoregulatory device

00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:59.070
to change the temperature in their home

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.921
by one degree or two degrees.

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.602
And now I do that.

00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:07.855
And I really didn't know what I would do,

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:10.400
but friends of mine began telling me

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.380
about children shooting other children with guns.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.195
And I asked the question,

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.153
what are you doing about it?

00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:20.261
What are you in America doing about it?

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.673
And there were two essential explanations

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.922
or ideas that were prevalent.

00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:26.976
And one was punishment.

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:29.149
And this I had heard about before.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.793
We who had worked in behavior

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:35.177
knew that punishment was something that was discussed

00:03:35.177 --> 00:03:38.014
but also that it was highly overvalued.

00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:40.358
It was not a main driver of behavior,

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:44.248
nor was it a main driver of behavior change.

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:46.298
And besides that, it reminded me

00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:48.800
of ancient epidemics

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.870
that were previously completely misunderstood

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.444
because the science hadn't been there before,

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:56.830
epidemics of plague

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.742
or typhus or leprosy,

00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:02.479
where the prevalent ideas were that there were

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.121
bad people or bad humors or bad air,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.730
and widows were dragged around the moat,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.177
and dungeons were part of the solution.

00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:14.330
The other explanation or, in a way,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.104
the solution suggested,

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:19.104
is please fix all of these things:

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:22.436
the schools, the community, the homes, the families,

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:23.962
everything.

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:25.775
And I'd heard this before as well.

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:28.510
I'd called this the "everything" theory,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.178
or EOE: Everything On Earth.

00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:32.789
But we'd also realized

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.426
in treating other processes and problems

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:39.341
that sometimes you don't need to treat everything.

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.525
And so the sense that I had

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:44.123
was there was a giant gap here.

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:46.869
The problem of violence was stuck,

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.135
and this has historically been the case

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:50.297
in many other issues.

00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:51.875
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.354
Malaria had been stuck.

00:04:53.354 --> 00:04:55.824
Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:59.114
It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:02.420
but there was a sense that we would have to do

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.673
something with new categories of workers

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:06.941
and something having to do with behavior change

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:11.050
and something having to do with public education.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.117
But I began to ask questions

00:05:13.117 --> 00:05:15.655
and search out the usual things

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:17.607
that I had been exploring before,

00:05:17.607 --> 00:05:19.140
like, what do the maps look like?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.590
What do the graphs look like?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.629
What does the data look like?

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.025
And the maps of violence

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.987
in most U.S. cities

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.979
looked like this.

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.643
There was clustering.

00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:33.981
This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:35.724
in infectious epidemics,

00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:37.716
for example cholera.

00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:40.083
And then we looked at the maps,

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:42.797
and the maps showed this typical wave

00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:44.590
upon wave upon wave,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.945
because all epidemics

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.519
are combinations of many epidemics.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:51.623
And it also looked like infectious epidemics.

00:05:51.623 --> 00:05:53.236
And then we asked the question,

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:56.778
well what really predicts a case of violence?

00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:59.023
And it turns out that the greatest predictor

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:02.331
of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.

00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.561
Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,

00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:08.461
someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,

00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:10.901
or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:13.953
is having been exposed to tuberculosis.

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:16.685
And so we see that violence is, in a way,

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:19.844
behaving like a contagious disease.

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:21.394
We're aware of this anyway

00:06:21.394 --> 00:06:23.330
even in our common experiences

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.140
or our newspaper stories

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.264
of the spread of violence from fights

00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:31.715
or in gang wars or in civil wars

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:33.973
or even in genocides.

00:06:33.973 --> 00:06:36.545
And so there's good news about this, though,

00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:39.350
because there's a way to reverse epidemics,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.356
and there's really only three things that are done

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:43.224
to reverse epidemics,

00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:45.864
and the first of it is interrupting transmission.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.790
In order to interrupt transmission,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.340
you need to detect and find first cases.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.354
In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody

00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:57.602
who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:59.019
Make sense?

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.283
And there's special workers for doing that.

00:07:01.283 --> 00:07:03.142
For this particular problem,

00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:05.457
we designed a new category of worker

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:06.802
who, like a SARS worker

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:08.663
or someone looking for bird flu,

00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:10.410
might find first cases.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.611
In this case, it's someone who's very angry

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.364
because someone looked at his girlfriend

00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:16.150
or owes him money,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.619
and you can find workers and train them

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.733
into these specialized categories.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.383
And the second thing to do, of course,

00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:24.884
is to prevent further spread,

00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:28.406
that means to find who else has been exposed,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.851
but may not be spreading so much right now

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:33.377
like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,

00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:36.231
or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,

00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:37.857
but in the same group,

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.154
and then they need to be, in a way,

00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:41.527
managed as well,

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.878
particular to the specific disease process.

00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:47.931
And then the third part, the shifting the norms,

00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:51.231
and that means a whole bunch of community activities,

00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.572
remodeling, public education,

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:55.709
and then you've got what you might call

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:56.931
group immunity.

00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:58.819
And that combination of factors

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.181
is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:03.618
was very successfully reversed.

00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:06.448
And so what we decided to do in the year 2000

00:08:06.448 --> 00:08:08.368
is kind of put this together in a way

00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:10.895
by hiring in new categories of workers,

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:13.470
the first being violence interruptors.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.132
And then we would put all of this into place

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:17.567
in one neighborhood

00:08:17.567 --> 00:08:19.977
in what was the worst police district

00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:21.884
in the United States at the time.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:24.627
So violence interruptors hired from the same group,

00:08:24.627 --> 00:08:27.612
credibility, trust, access,

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:30.230
just like the health workers in Somalia,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.497
but designed for a different category,

00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:34.469
and trained in persuasion,

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:38.247
cooling people down, buying time, reframing.

00:08:38.247 --> 00:08:40.213
And then another category of worker,

00:08:40.213 --> 00:08:42.753
the outreach workers, to keep people

00:08:42.753 --> 00:08:46.123
in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:49.782
Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:51.590
And then a bunch of community activities

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.285
for changing norms.

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:55.652
Now our first experiment of this

00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:58.329
resulted in a 67-percent drop

00:08:58.329 --> 00:08:59.800
in shootings and killings

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.197
in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.

00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:04.347
(Applause)

00:09:04.347 --> 00:09:05.707
And this was a beautiful thing

00:09:05.707 --> 00:09:07.323
for the neighborhood itself,

00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:10.215
first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:11.994
and then there was unfortunately another shooting

00:09:11.994 --> 00:09:13.513
in another 90 days,

00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:15.953
and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.

00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:18.351
They were using parks they weren't using before.

00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:20.488
The sun was out. Everybody was happy.

00:09:20.488 --> 00:09:23.678
But of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,

00:09:23.678 --> 00:09:25.005
do it again."

00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:28.322
And so we had to then, fortunately,

00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:31.081
get the funds to repeat this experience,

00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:33.092
and this is one of the next four neighborhoods

00:09:33.092 --> 00:09:36.112
that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.

00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:38.888
And since that time, this has been replicated

00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:40.504
20 times.

00:09:40.504 --> 00:09:42.585
There have been independent evaluations

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:44.531
supported by the Justice Department

00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:47.308
and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins

00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:51.102
that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:53.211
reductions in shootings and killings

00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:55.133
using this new method.

00:09:55.133 --> 00:09:56.580
In fact, there have been three independent

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.698
evaluations of this now.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.955
Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:03.151
including being featured on

00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:07.096
The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:09.894
The Economist in 2009

00:10:09.894 --> 00:10:12.108
said this is "the approach that will come to prominence."

00:10:12.108 --> 00:10:14.445
And even a movie was made around our work.

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:15.613
[The Interrupters]

00:10:15.613 --> 00:10:18.117
However, not so fast,

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.979
because a lot of people did not agree

00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:21.960
with this way of going about it.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.923
We got a lot of criticism,

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.662
a lot of opposition,

00:10:25.662 --> 00:10:27.397
and a lot of opponents.

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:30.248
In other words, what do you mean, health problem?

00:10:30.248 --> 00:10:32.834
What do you mean, epidemic?

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:35.642
What do you mean, no bad guys?

00:10:35.642 --> 00:10:37.795
And there's whole industries designed

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:40.753
for managing bad people.

00:10:40.753 --> 00:10:43.796
What do you mean, hiring people

00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:45.745
who have backgrounds?

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:50.244
My business friends said,

00:10:50.244 --> 00:10:53.591
"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:55.589
You must be doing something right."

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:57.598
(Laughter)

00:10:57.598 --> 00:11:00.853
My musician friends added the word "dude."

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:04.624
So anyway, additionally,

00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:06.449
there was still this problem,

00:11:06.449 --> 00:11:09.354
and we were getting highly criticized as well

00:11:09.354 --> 00:11:12.650
for not dealing with all of these other problems.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.780
Yet we were able to manage malaria

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.532
and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases

00:11:18.532 --> 00:11:20.470
in places with awful economies

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.290
without healing the economy.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.825
So what's actually happened is,

00:11:24.825 --> 00:11:27.270
although there is still some opposition,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.090
the movement is clearly growing.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.174
Many of the major cities in the U.S.,

00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:33.412
including New York City and Baltimore

00:11:33.412 --> 00:11:34.677
and Kansas City,

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:36.610
their health departments are running this now.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.231
Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.762
are having a very large role in this.

00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:44.617
This is being embraced more by law enforcement

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:46.596
than it had been years ago.

00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:48.650
Trauma centers and hospitals

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.944
are doing their part in stepping up.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.837
And the U.S. Conference of Mayors

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.430
has endorsed not only the approach

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.723
but the specific model.

00:11:57.723 --> 00:12:00.972
Where there's really been uptake even faster

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:02.969
is in the international environment,

00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:04.725
where there's a 55-percent drop

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.149
in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:09.955
where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,

00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:12.869
where the strategy has been applied in Kenya

00:12:12.869 --> 00:12:15.515
for the recent elections,

00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:18.688
and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.

00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:21.963
So violence is responding as a disease

00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:24.228
even as it behaves as a disease.

00:12:24.228 --> 00:12:26.431
So the theory, in a way,

00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.596
is kind of being validated by the treatment.

00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:33.530
And recently, the Institute of Medicine

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.667
came out with a workshop report

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.531
which went through some of the data,

00:12:37.531 --> 00:12:39.076
including the neuroscience,

00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:43.399
on how this problem is really transmitted.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:46.310
So I think this is good news,

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.174
because it allows us an opportunity

00:12:48.174 --> 00:12:49.729
to come out of the Middle Ages,

00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:52.771
which is where I feel this field has been.

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:55.877
It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility

00:12:55.877 --> 00:12:58.673
of replacing some of these prisons

00:12:58.673 --> 00:13:01.955
with playgrounds or parks,

00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:04.623
and to consider the possibility

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:08.310
of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.764
and to allow there to be a new strategy,

00:13:11.764 --> 00:13:15.625
a new set of methods, a new set of workers:

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:19.040
science, in a way, replacing morality.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.424
And moving away from emotions

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:24.611
is the most important part of the solution

00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:28.929
to science as a more important part of the solution.

00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:33.652
So I didn't mean to come up with this at all.

00:13:33.652 --> 00:13:36.154
It was a matter of,

00:13:36.154 --> 00:13:37.985
I wanted actually a break,

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:42.096
and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,

00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:43.733
we asked some questions

00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:46.929
and tried some tools

00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:49.486
that actually have been used many times before

00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:51.404
for other things.

00:13:51.404 --> 00:13:54.659
For myself, I tried to get away from

00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:56.402
infectious diseases,

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.357
and I didn't.

00:13:58.357 --> 00:13:59.984
Thank you.

00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:03.274
(Applause)
