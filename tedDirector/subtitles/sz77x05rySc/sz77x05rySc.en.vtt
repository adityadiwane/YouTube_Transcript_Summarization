00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Well we all know the World Wide Web

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
commerce and social connectivity,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
but where did it all come from?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And I'll quote three people:

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
So let's just run through these guys.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
This is Vannevar Bush.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And in 1945,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And the article was called "As We May Think."

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And what Vannevar Bush was saying

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
was the way we use information is broken.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
We don't work in terms of libraries

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and catalog systems and so forth.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
The brain works by association.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And the way information is structured

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And so he suggested a machine,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and he called it the memex.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And the memex would link information,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now this was in 1945.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
A computer in those days

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And nobody knew anything about it.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So this was before the computer was invented.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And he proposed this machine called the memex.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and then you could call it up at will.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So spinning forward,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And he was so inspired by this article,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
it kind of directed the rest of his life.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
He built a system.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And in a premonition of today's world

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
of cloud computing and softwares of service,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
his system was called NLS

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
for oN-Line System.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
in 1968.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
What he showed --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
He had his head mic like I've got.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And he works this system.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And you can see, he's working between documents

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and graphics and so forth.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And he's driving it all

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
with this platform here,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
with a five-finger keyboard

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and the world's first computer mouse,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
which he specially designed in order to do this system.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So this is where the mouse came from as well.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So for a personal computer,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
it wasn't really very practical.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
But spin on to the 80s

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
when personal computers did arrive,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And my company, OWL

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And this began to get a head of steam.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and they made a bit of a fuss about it.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
The magazines started to cover it.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
had special issues covering hypertext.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
We developed a PC version of this product

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
as well as the Macintosh version.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And our PC version became quite mature.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
We developed a system such

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
that it had a markup language based on html.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And the system was capable of doing

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
in late November 1990.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And he said, "I need to talk to you."

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
would take over the world one day.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
it was just plain text.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I thought, well, you know, interesting,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So we didn't do it.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
In the next couple of years,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
In 1993,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
there was a table at the conference in Seattle,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and a guy called Marc Andreessen

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
There was a guy called Dick Rowe

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
There was a guy called Gary Kildall

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
who went flying his plane

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
when IBM came looking for an operating system

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
for the IBM PC,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And the 12 publishers

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And according to Fortune magazine,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
he's worth 700 million dollars.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
But is he happy?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
(Laughter)

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.260
(Applause)
