00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:17.182
It was April 8, 2003.

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:22.381
I was in Baghdad,
covering the war in Iraq.

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:27.063
That day, Americans tanks
started arriving in Baghdad.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.333
We were just a few journalists
in the Palestine Hotel,

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.858
and, as happens in war,

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.886
the fighting began to approach
outside our windows.

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:46.525
Baghdad was covered
in black smoke and oil.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:48.113
It smelled awful.

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.828
We couldn't see a thing,
but we knew what was happening.

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:53.342
Of course, I was supposed
to be writing an article,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.902
but that's how it always goes --

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:57.564
you're supposed to be writing
and something big happens.

00:00:57.588 --> 00:01:00.315
So I was in my room on the 16th floor,

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.221
writing and looking out the window
every now and then

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.029
to see what was happening.

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:07.523
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.483
During the previous three weeks,

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:13.626
there had been shelling
with half-ton missiles,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.840
but this time, the shock --

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:19.225
I felt it inside of me,

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.250
and I thought, "It's very close.

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:23.272
It's very, very close."

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:25.676
So I went down to see what was happening.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.389
I went down to the 15th floor

00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.019
to take a look.

00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:34.195
And I saw people, journalists,
screaming in the hallways.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.901
I walked into a room

00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:41.125
and realized that it had
been hit by a missile.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.170
Someone had been wounded.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.372
There was a man near the window,

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:50.579
a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.247
lying face-down.

00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:02.972
Having worked in a hospital before,
I wanted to help out.

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:04.497
So I turned him over.

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.223
And when I turned him over,

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:11.485
I noticed that he was open
from sternum to pubis,

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.619
but I couldn't see anything,
nothing at all.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:21.221
All I saw was a white, pearly,
shiny spot that blinded me,

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.252
and I didn't understand what was going on.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.531
Once the spot disappeared
and I could see his wound,

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.132
which was very serious,

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.251
my buddies and I put a sheet
underneath him,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.060
and we carried him onto an elevator
that stopped at each of the 15 floors.

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.960
We put him in a car
that took him to the hospital.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:38.746
He died on the way to the hospital.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.760
The Spanish cameraman JosÃ© Couso,
who was on the 14th floor and also hit --

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:47.094
because the shell had exploded
between the two floors --

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:49.054
died on the operating table.

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:51.475
As soon as the car left, I went back.

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.832
There was that article
I was supposed to write --

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.522
which I had to write.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.846
And so --

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.768
I returned to the hotel lobby
with my arms covered in blood,

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.332
when one of the hotel gofers stopped me

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:11.203
and asked me to pay the tax
I hadn't paid for 10 days.

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:13.035
I told him to get lost.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.669
And I said to myself:
"Clear your head, put it all aside.

00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:21.546
If you want to write,
you need to put it all aside."

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.785
And that's what I did.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.713
I went upstairs, wrote
my article and sent it off.

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:30.998
Later, aside from the feeling
of having lost my colleagues,

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:34.418
something else was bothering me.

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:38.209
I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:43.123
and I couldn't understand what it meant.

00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:46.246
And then, the war was over.

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:54.668
Later, I thought: "That's not possible.
I can't just not know what happened."

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:58.153
Because it wasn't the first time,
and it didn't only happen to me.

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:02.082
I have seen things like that
happen to others

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:04.774
in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:08.084
I have seen things
that had an effect on me too.

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:11.153
For example, there was this man
I knew in Lebanon,

00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:14.083
a 25-year-old veteran
who had been fighting for five years --

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:16.450
a real veteran -- who we would
follow everywhere.

00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:19.960
He would crawl in the dark
with confidence --

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:23.143
he was a great soldier, a true soldier --

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.524
so we would follow him,
knowing that we would be safe with him.

00:04:26.548 --> 00:04:28.856
And one day, as I was told --

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.476
and I've seen him again since --

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.841
he was back in the camp, playing cards,

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:34.746
when someone came in next door,

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:38.294
and discharged their weapon.

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:39.826
As the gun went off,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.405
that blast, that one shot,
made him duck quickly under the table,

00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:47.418
like a child.

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.333
He was shaking, panicking.

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:54.165
And since then, he has never
been able to get up and fight.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.881
He ended up working as a croupier

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.027
in a Beirut casino
where I later found him,

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.920
because he couldn't sleep,
so it was quite a suitable job.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:04.195
So I thought to myself,

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:07.218
"What is this thing that can kill you

00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:12.592
without leaving
any visible scars?

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:14.957
How does that happen?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.040
What is this unknown thing?"

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:23.573
It was too common to be coincidental.

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:25.255
So I started to investigate --

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.273
that's all I know how to do.

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:29.140
I started to investigate

00:05:29.164 --> 00:05:31.711
by looking through books,

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:35.178
reaching out to psychiatrists,

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:37.764
going to museums, libraries, etc.

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:42.323
Finally, I discovered
that some people knew about this --

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.880
often military psychiatrists --

00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:49.793
and that what we were dealing with
was called trauma.

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:54.643
Americans call it PTSD
or traumatic neurosis.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:56.532
It was something

00:05:58.262 --> 00:05:59.658
that existed,

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:02.388
but that we never spoke about.

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:05.610
So, this trauma --

00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:07.609
what is it?

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.444
Well, it's an encounter with death.

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:13.928
I don't know if you've ever had
an experience with death --

00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:15.835
I'm not talking about dead bodies,

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:19.460
or someone's grandfather
lying in a hospital bed,

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:23.058
or someone who got hit by a car.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:28.594
I'm talking about facing
the void of death.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:35.861
And that is something
no one is supposed to see.

00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:37.727
People used to say,

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.726
"Neither the sun, nor death
can be looked at with a steady eye."

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.984
A human being should not
have to face the void of death.

00:06:46.008 --> 00:06:47.849
But when that happens,

00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:53.549
it can remain invisible for a while --

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:56.341
days, weeks, months, sometimes years.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.126
And then, at some point,

00:06:59.587 --> 00:07:00.873
it explodes,

00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:04.641
because it's something
that has entered your brain --

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:09.316
a sort of window between an image
and your mind --

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.665
that has penetrated your brain,

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.279
staying there and taking up
all the space inside.

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.190
And there are people --
men, women,

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:23.496
who suddenly no longer sleep.

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:26.721
And they experience
horrible anxiety attacks --

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:29.775
panic attacks, not just minor fears.

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.105
They suddenly don't want to sleep,

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:36.663
because when they do, they have
the same nightmare every night.

00:07:36.687 --> 00:07:38.607
They see the same image every night.

00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:40.258
What type of image?

00:07:40.282 --> 00:07:43.085
For example, a soldier
who enters a building

00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:45.943
and comes face to face
with another soldier aiming at him.

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.530
He looks at the gun,
straight down the barrel.

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:52.138
And this barrel suddenly
becomes enormous, deformed.

00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:54.916
It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.540
And he says --

00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:00.718
later he will say, "I saw death.

00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:03.243
I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:07.124
And from then on, he knows he is dead.

00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:12.033
It is not a perception --
he is convinced that he is dead.

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:15.589
In reality, someone came in,
the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,

00:08:15.613 --> 00:08:17.260
and he didn't actually get shot --

00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:18.992
but to him, he died in that moment.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:21.123
Or it can be the smell
of a mass grave --

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.952
I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.502
It can be the voice of a friend calling,

00:08:27.113 --> 00:08:30.873
and they're being slaughtered
and there's nothing you can do.

00:08:30.897 --> 00:08:32.103
You hear that voice,

00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:37.633
and you wake up every night --
for weeks, months --

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.414
in a trance-like state,
anxious and terrified,

00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:41.793
like a child.

00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:43.396
I have seen men cry --

00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:46.015
just like children --

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.138
from seeing the same image.

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:52.928
So having that image
of horror in your brain,

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.497
seeing the void of death --

00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.226
that analogue of horror
which is hiding something --

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.504
will completely take over.

00:09:01.528 --> 00:09:03.835
You cannot do anything, anything at all.

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:05.153
You cannot work anymore,

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.460
you cannot love anymore.

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:08.411
You go home and don't recognize anyone.

00:09:08.435 --> 00:09:10.442
You don't even recognize yourself.

00:09:13.181 --> 00:09:16.705
You hide and don't leave the house,
you lock yourself in, you become ill.

00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:21.143
I know people who placed small cans
outside their house with coins inside,

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:23.033
in case someone tried to get in.

00:09:23.057 --> 00:09:25.929
All of a sudden, you feel
like you want to die or kill

00:09:25.953 --> 00:09:27.501
or hide or run away.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.676
You want to be loved,
but you hate everyone.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.613
It's a feeling that seizes you entirely

00:09:34.644 --> 00:09:36.375
day in and day out,

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.303
and you suffer tremendously.

00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:42.828
And no one understands.

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:46.620
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you.
You seem fine, you have no injuries.

00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:49.138
You went to war, came back; you're fine."

00:09:50.231 --> 00:09:52.113
These people suffer tremendously.

00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:53.716
Some commit suicide.

00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:56.749
After all, suicide is like updating
your daily planner --

00:09:56.773 --> 00:09:59.084
I'm already dead,
I might as well commit suicide.

00:09:59.108 --> 00:10:01.043
Plus, there is no more pain.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:05.097
Some commit suicide,
others end up under the bridge, drinking.

00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:09.493
Everyone remembers
that grandfather or uncle or neighbor

00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:11.487
who used to drink, never said a word,

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:13.280
always in a bad mood, beat his wife

00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:17.433
and who would end up either sinking
into alcoholism or dying.

00:10:17.457 --> 00:10:20.237
And why do we not talk about this?

00:10:20.261 --> 00:10:23.380
We don't talk about it because it's taboo.

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:27.924
It's not like we don't have the words
to express the void of death.

00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:29.716
But others don't want hear it.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.854
The first time I returned
from an assignment,

00:10:31.878 --> 00:10:33.404
They said, "Oh! He's back."

00:10:33.428 --> 00:10:36.524
There was a fancy dinner --
white tablecloth, candles, guests.

00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:37.740
"Tell us everything!"

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:39.087
Which I did.

00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:42.559
After 20 minutes, people
were giving me dirty looks,

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:44.588
the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.

00:10:44.612 --> 00:10:47.583
It was horrible and I realized
I ruined the whole evening.

00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:49.516
So I don't talk about it anymore.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.081
We're just not ready to listen.

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:52.833
People say outright: "Please, stop."

00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:54.954
Is that a rare occurrence?

00:10:54.978 --> 00:10:57.380
No, it's extremely common.

00:10:57.404 --> 00:10:59.557
One third of the soldiers
who died in Iraq --

00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.103
well, not "died," let me re-phrase that --

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:05.267
one third of the US soldiers
who went to Iraq

00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:06.929
suffer from PTSD.

00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:12.874
In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers
from the First World War

00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:16.273
that were being treated
in British psychiatric hospitals.

00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:19.500
In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --

00:11:19.524 --> 00:11:20.867
Americans.

00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:25.064
In 1987, the US government
identified 102,000 --

00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:26.302
twice as many --

00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:28.950
102,000 veterans who died
from committing suicide.

00:11:28.974 --> 00:11:31.790
Twice as many deaths by suicide
than by combat in Vietnam.

00:11:31.814 --> 00:11:34.972
So you see, this relates to everything,

00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:37.335
not just modern warfare,
but also ancient wars --

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:40.358
you can read about it,
the evidence is there.

00:11:40.382 --> 00:11:42.627
So why do we not talk about it?

00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.096
Why have we not talked about it?

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.588
The problem is that
if you don't talk about it,

00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:52.237
you're heading for disaster.

00:11:53.528 --> 00:11:56.343
The only way to heal --

00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:59.565
and the good news here
is that this is treatable --

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:02.900
think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:04.209
it's indeed treatable.

00:12:04.233 --> 00:12:08.793
The only way to heal from this trauma,

00:12:08.817 --> 00:12:13.873
from this encounter with death
that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:17.897
is to find a way to express it.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.279
People used to say,

00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:23.870
"Language is the only thing
that holds all of us together."

00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:26.235
Without language, we're nothing.

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:28.876
It's the thing that makes us human.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.877
In the face of such a horrible image --

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:36.427
a wordless image of oblivion
that obsesses us --

00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:38.910
the only way to cope with it

00:12:40.109 --> 00:12:42.210
is to put human words to it.

00:12:42.234 --> 00:12:44.660
Because these people
feel excluded from humanity.

00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:47.890
No one wants to see them anymore
and they don't want to see anyone.

00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:50.335
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.

00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:53.603
Someone said, "Doctor,
I don't use the subway anymore

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:56.841
because I'm afraid people
will see the horror in my eyes."

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.731
Another guy thought he had
a terrible skin disease

00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:03.592
and spent six months with dermatologists,
going from doctor to doctor.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.155
And then one day, they sent him
to a psychiatrist.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:08.584
During his second session,
he told the psychiatrist

00:13:08.608 --> 00:13:10.938
he had a terrible skin disease
from head to toe.

00:13:10.962 --> 00:13:13.881
The psychiatrist asked,
"Why are you in this state?"

00:13:13.905 --> 00:13:17.231
And the man said, "Well, because
I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:21.668
So you see this is something
that has a profound effect on people.

00:13:21.692 --> 00:13:24.101
In order to heal,
we need to talk about it.

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:28.069
The horror needs to be put into words --

00:13:28.093 --> 00:13:32.276
human words, so we can organize it
and talk about it again.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.442
We have to look death in the face.

00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:42.156
And if we can do that,
if we can talk about these things,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.605
then step by step,
by working it out verbally,

00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:48.557
we can reclaim our place in humanity.

00:13:49.549 --> 00:13:50.813
And it is important.

00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:52.525
Silence kills us.

00:13:53.789 --> 00:13:55.211
So what does this mean?

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:57.251
It means that after a trauma,

00:13:57.275 --> 00:14:00.910
without question, we lose
our "unbearable lightness of being,"

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:03.688
that sense of immortality
that keeps us here --

00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:07.624
meaning, if we're here, we almost feel
like we're immortal, which we're not,

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:10.991
but if we didn't believe that,
we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"

00:14:11.015 --> 00:14:13.805
But trauma survivors have lost
that feeling of immortality.

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:15.224
They've lost their lightness.

00:14:15.248 --> 00:14:16.987
But they have found something else.

00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:20.271
So this means that if we manage
to look death in the face,

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:26.448
and actually confront it,
rather than keep quiet and hide,

00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:28.951
like some of the men or women I know did,

00:14:28.975 --> 00:14:35.629
such as Michael from Rwanda,
Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo

00:14:35.653 --> 00:14:36.879
and other people I know,

00:14:36.903 --> 00:14:39.001
like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,

00:14:39.025 --> 00:14:41.316
who gave up field assignments
after a trauma.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.558
Five friends of mine committed suicide,

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:46.158
they're the ones
who did not survive the trauma.

00:14:46.182 --> 00:14:51.728
So if we can look death in the face,

00:14:51.752 --> 00:14:54.530
if we, mortal humans, human mortals,

00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:57.395
understand that we are human
and mortal, mortal and human,

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:03.666
if we can confront death
and identify it once again

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.753
as the most mysterious place
of all mysterious places,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.126
since no one has ever seen it --

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.813
if we can give it back this meaning,

00:15:12.837 --> 00:15:15.678
yes, we may die,

00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:19.281
survive

00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:21.438
and come back to life,

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.555
but we'll come back stronger than before.

00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:25.889
Much stronger.

00:15:25.913 --> 00:15:27.067
Thank you.

00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:28.858
(Applause)
