00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:19.604
Imagine a place where your neighbors
greet your children by name;

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:22.931
a place with splendid vistas;

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.066
a place where you can drive
just 20 minutes

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.152
and put your sailboat on the water.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.259
It's a seductive place, isn't it?

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:33.857
I don't live there.

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.430
(Laughter)

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:42.473
But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:48.859
for two years, to the fastest-growing
and whitest counties in America.

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:52.201
What is a Whitopia?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.975
I define Whitopia in three ways:

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:02.658
First, a Whitopia has posted at least
six percent population growth since 2000.

00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.924
Secondly, the majority of that growth
comes from white migrants.

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:12.215
And third, the Whitopia
has an ineffable charm,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.794
a pleasant look and feel,

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:16.326
a je Ne sais quoi.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.559
(Laughter)

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:23.975
To learn how and why
Whitopias are ticking,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.422
I immersed myself for several months
apiece in three of them:

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:32.096
first, St. George, Utah;

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.557
second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.184
and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:44.409
First stop, St. George --
a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:49.786
In the 1850s, Brigham Young
dispatched families to St. George

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.094
to grow cotton because
of the hot, arid climate.

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:57.546
And so they called it Utah's Dixie,
and the name sticks to this day.

00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:05.330
I approached my time in each Whitopia
like an anthropologist.

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:09.975
I made detailed spreadsheets of all
the power brokers in the communities,

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.433
who I needed to meet,
where I needed to be,

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:16.675
and I threw myself with gusto
in these communities.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.975
I went to zoning board meetings,

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.762
I went to Democratic clubs
and Republican clubs.

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:24.698
I went to poker nights.

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:32.118
In St. George, I rented
a home at the Entrada,

00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:35.254
one of the town's
premier gated communities.

00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:39.596
There were no Motel 6's
or Howard Johnsons for me.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.954
I lived in Whitopia as a resident,
and not like a visitor.

00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:49.385
I rented myself this home by phone.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.948
(Laughter)

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.337
(Applause)

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:59.321
Golf is the perfect seductive
symbol of Whitopia.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.560
When I went on my journey,

00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:04.699
I had barely ever held a golf club.

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:09.398
By the time I left, I was golfing
at least three times a week.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:12.109
(Laughter)

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.069
Golf helps people bond.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:21.336
Some of the best interviews I ever scored
during my trip were on the golf courses.

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:27.175
One venture capitalist, for example,
invited me to golf in his private club

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.254
that had no minority members.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.408
I also went fishing.

00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:34.433
(Laughter)

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:37.473
Because I had never fished,
this fellow had to teach me

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:40.273
how to cast my line and what bait to use.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.821
I also played poker every weekend.

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.677
It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.

00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:54.317
My poker mates may have been bluffing
about the hands that they drew,

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:57.523
but they weren't bluffing
about their social beliefs.

00:03:57.547 --> 00:04:01.150
Some of the most raw,
salty conversations I ever had

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.879
during my journey were at the poker table.

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.957
I'm a gung ho entertainer.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.116
I love to cook, I hosted
many dinner parties, and in return,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.288
people invited me to their dinner parties,

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:17.970
and to their barbecues,
and to their pool parties,

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.789
and to their birthday parties.

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:22.852
But it wasn't all fun.

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:28.143
Immigration turned out to be
a big issue in this Whitopia.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.581
The St. George's Citizens Council
on Illegal Immigration

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:35.699
held regular and active protests
against immigration,

00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:41.624
and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia
is what a hot debate this would become.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:45.633
It was a real-time preview,
and so it has become.

00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:52.427
Next stop: Almost Heaven,
a cabin I rented for myself

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:56.118
in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful
North Idaho panhandle.

00:04:57.048 --> 00:05:00.071
I rented this place
for myself, also by phone.

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:01.475
(Laughter)

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.350
The book "A Thousand Places To See
Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene --

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:11.468
it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen,
boatmen and fishermen.

00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:16.064
My growing golf skills
came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:19.032
I golfed with retired LAPD cops.

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:25.224
In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops

00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:31.358
fled Los Angeles
after the L.A. racial unrest,

00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:35.404
for North Idaho, and they've built
an expatriated community.

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.822
Given the conservatism of these cops,

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:45.188
there's no surprise that North Idaho
has a strong gun culture.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:50.994
In fact, it is said, North Idaho
has more gun dealers than gas stations.

00:05:53.677 --> 00:05:56.813
So what's a resident to do to fit in?

00:05:56.837 --> 00:05:58.203
I hit the gun club.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:02.337
When I rented a gun,
the gentleman behind the counter

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.975
was perfectly pleasant and kind,

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.940
until I showed him
my New York City driver's license.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.497
That's when he got nervous.

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:15.036
I'm not as bad a shot
as I thought I might have been.

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:22.904
What I learned from North Idaho
is the peculiar brand of paranoia

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:28.043
that can permeate a community
when so many cops and guns are around.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.777
In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,

00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:36.158
I kept a notepad.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.938
And in that notepad I counted
more Confederate flags than black people.

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.852
In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:49.101
on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.422
and on cars.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.225
About a seven-minute drive
from my hidden lake cabin

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.066
was the compound of Aryan Nations,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.082
the white supremacist group.

00:07:02.384 --> 00:07:07.456
America's Promise Ministries,
the religious arm of Aryan Nations,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.968
happened to have a three-day
retreat during my visit.

00:07:12.913 --> 00:07:14.548
So I decided to crash it.

00:07:14.572 --> 00:07:17.184
(Laughter)

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:22.043
I'm the only non-Aryan journalist
I'm aware of ever to have done so.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.129
(Laughter)

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:27.766
Among the many memorable
episodes of that retreat...

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.059
(Laughter)

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:32.975
...is when Abe, an Aryan,
sidled up next to me.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:38.419
He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey
Rich, I just want you to know one thing.

00:07:38.443 --> 00:07:42.943
We are not white supremacists.
We are white separatists.

00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:44.841
We don't think we're better than you,

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.554
we just want to be away from you."

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:50.992
(Laughter)

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:58.011
Indeed, most white people in Whitopia
are neither white supremacists

00:07:58.035 --> 00:07:59.850
or white separatists;

00:07:59.874 --> 00:08:03.799
in fact, they're not there
for explicitly racial reasons at all.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.196
Rather, they emigrate there

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.928
for friendliness, comfort,
security, safety --

00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:15.945
reasons that they implicitly associate
to whiteness in itself.

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.938
Next stop was Georgia.

00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:24.336
In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb
north of Atlanta.

00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:26.822
In Utah, I found poker;

00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:28.537
in Idaho, I found guns;

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.115
in Georgia, I found God.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:31.378
(Laughter)

00:08:31.402 --> 00:08:34.975
The way that I immersed myself
in this Whitopia

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:38.390
was to become active
at First Redeemer Church,

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:41.918
a megachurch that's so huge
that it has golf carts

00:08:41.942 --> 00:08:47.107
to escort the congregants around
its many parking lots on campus.

00:08:47.758 --> 00:08:50.467
I was active in the youth ministry.

00:08:50.491 --> 00:08:55.423
And for me, personally,
I was more comfortable in this Whitopia

00:08:55.447 --> 00:09:00.080
than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,
or even a suburban Boston.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:04.089
That is because [there], in Georgia,

00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:08.632
white people and black people are more
historically familiar to one another.

00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:11.888
I was less exotic in this Whitopia.

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:13.912
(Laughter)

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:16.271
But what does it all mean?

00:09:17.042 --> 00:09:22.423
Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,
is a push-pull phenomenon,

00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:26.588
full of alarming pushes
and alluring pulls,

00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:33.225
and Whitopia operates at the level
of conscious and unconscious bias.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.263
It's possible for people to be in Whitopia
not for racist reasons,

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.577
though it has racist outcomes.

00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:47.548
Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:53.089
social welfare abuse, minorities,
density, crowded schools.

00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:58.292
Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,

00:09:58.316 --> 00:10:04.080
freedom, the allure of privatism --
privatized places, privatized people,

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.421
privatized things.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:13.112
And I learned in Whitopia
how a country can have racism

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:14.471
without racists.

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:18.028
Many of my smug urban liberal friends

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:20.789
couldn't believe I would go
on such a venture.

00:10:21.447 --> 00:10:26.969
The reality is that many white Americans
are affable and kind.

00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:32.412
Interpersonal race relations --
how we treat each other as human beings --

00:10:32.436 --> 00:10:36.043
are vastly better than in
my parents' generation.

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:40.785
Can you imagine me going
to Whitopia 40 years ago?

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:43.484
What a journey that would have been.

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:45.266
(Laughter)

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.159
And yet, some things haven't changed.

00:10:47.572 --> 00:10:54.283
America is as residentially
and educationally segregated today

00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:56.874
as it was in 1970.

00:10:59.523 --> 00:11:04.154
As Americans, we often find ways
to cook for each other,

00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:05.798
to dance with each other,

00:11:05.822 --> 00:11:07.695
to host with each other,

00:11:07.719 --> 00:11:12.767
but why can't that translate into how we
treat each other as communities?

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:15.355
It's a devastating irony,

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:18.691
how we have gone forward as individuals,

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:21.325
and backwards as communities.

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:28.059
One of the Whitopian outlooks
that really hit me

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.255
was a proverbial saying:

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.755
"One black man is
a delightful dinner guest;

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:35.821
50 black men is a ghetto."

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:47.755
One of the big contexts animating
my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.

00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:54.776
By 2042, white people will no longer be
the American majority.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.751
As such, will there be more Whitopias?

00:12:00.926 --> 00:12:02.613
In looking at this,

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:09.344
the danger of Whitopia is
that the more segregation we have,

00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:15.169
the less we can look at and confront
conscious and unconscious bias.

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:22.665
I ventured on my two-year,
27,000 mile journey

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:27.776
to learn where, why, and how
white people are fleeing,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.542
but I didn't expect to have
so much fun on my journey.

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:31.573
(Laughter)

00:12:31.597 --> 00:12:34.487
I didn't expect to learn
so much about myself.

00:12:35.408 --> 00:12:38.856
I don't expect I'll be living
in a Whitopia --

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.991
or a Blacktopia, for that matter.

00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:45.201
I do plan to continue golfing
every chance I get.

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:46.787
(Laughter)

00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:51.436
And I'll just have to leave the guns
and megachurches back in Whitopia.

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:53.866
Thank you.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:59.976
(Applause)
