00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:15.976
What do you see?

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:20.768
Most of you see a barbershop,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.680
but I see an opportunity:

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:26.429
an opportunity for health,

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.778
an opportunity for health equity.

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:33.802
For black men, the barbershop
is not just a place

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:36.548
where you get your hair cut
or your beard trimmed.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.342
No, it's much more than that.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:44.196
Historically, the barbershop
has been a safe haven for black men.

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.570
It's a place where we go for friendship,

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:50.935
solidarity and solace.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.687
It's a place where we go
to get away from the stress

00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:58.958
of the grind of work

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:00.672
and sometimes home life.

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.202
It's a place where we don't have to worry

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.709
about how we're being perceived
by the outside world.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.542
It's a place where we don't
feel threatened,

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.907
or threatening.

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.312
It's a place of loyalty and trust.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.478
For that reason,

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:24.401
it's one of the few places
where we can fearlessly be ourselves

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.058
and just ... talk.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.534
The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.199
that is the essence
of the black barbershop.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.056
I can remember going to the barbershop
with my dad as a kid.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:42.562
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop
every other Saturday.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.197
And like clockwork,
the same group of men would be there

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:48.942
every time we went,

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.323
either waiting on their favorite barber

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.990
or just soaking up the atmosphere.

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:59.169
I can remember the jovial greeting
that warmly welcomed us

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:00.614
every time we went.

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:04.860
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.670
He's a local pastor,
and they treated him like a celebrity.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.242
"Hey young fella, how you doing?"

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.718
they would say to me,

00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.837
making me feel just as special.

00:02:17.118 --> 00:02:21.380
I remember the range
of the conversations was immense.

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:26.396
The men would talk about politics
and sports and music

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:30.752
and world news, national news,

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.117
neighborhood news.

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:34.736
There was some talk about women

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:39.014
and what it was like to be
a black man in America.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:43.013
But many times they also
talked about health.

00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.949
The conversations about health
were lengthy and deep.

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:52.584
The men often recounted
their doctor's recommendations

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:54.699
to cut salt in their diet

00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:57.444
or to eat less fried foods

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.689
or to stop smoking

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:01.222
or to reduce stress.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.332
They talked about the different ways
you could reduce stress,

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:07.611
like simplifying one's love life --

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:12.842
(Laughter)

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:16.219
all ways to treat high blood pressure.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:20.821
There's a lot of talk about
high blood pressure in the barbershop.

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:26.608
That's because almost 40 percent
of black men have it.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.133
That means that almost
every single black man

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:34.099
either has high blood pressure

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:36.083
or knows a black man who has it.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.187
Sometimes, those conversations
in the barbershop

00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:43.850
would be about what happens
when high blood pressure

00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:45.500
is not adequately addressed.

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.088
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy?
He had a stroke."

00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:57.867
"Did you hear about Eddie?
He died last week.

00:03:57.891 --> 00:03:59.579
Massive heart attack.

00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:00.795
He was 50."

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:06.503
More black men die from high blood
pressure than from anything else,

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:11.422
even though decades of medical wisdom
and science have demonstrated

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:14.590
that death from high blood pressure
can be prevented

00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:17.969
with timely diagnosis
and appropriate treatment.

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:22.985
So why is high blood pressure
so differentially deadly for black men?

00:04:24.457 --> 00:04:28.367
Because too often, high blood pressure
is either untreated

00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:31.032
or under-treated in black men,

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:35.194
in part because of our lower engagement
with the primary healthcare system.

00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:40.339
Black men, in particular
those with high blood pressure,

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.467
are less likely to have
a primary care doctor

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.641
than other groups.

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:45.410
But why?

00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:49.481
Some of our earliest research
on black men's health

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:54.119
revealed that for many, the doctor's
office is associated with fear,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.015
mistrust,

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.060
disrespect,

00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:01.266
and unnecessary unpleasantness.

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:07.327
The doctor's office is only a place
that you go when you don't feel well.

00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:11.192
And when you do go,
you might wait for hours

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.565
only to get the run-around

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:18.160
and to be evaluated by
a stoic figure in a white coat

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:20.811
who only has 10 minutes to give you

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:23.700
and who doesn't value the talk.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:28.683
So it's no wonder that some men
don't want to be bothered

00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:32.003
and skip going to the doctor altogether,

00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:34.159
especially if they feel fine.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.341
But herein lies the problem.

00:05:38.328 --> 00:05:40.449
You can feel just fine

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:44.296
while high blood pressure ravages
your most vital organs.

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:49.501
This is Denny Moe,

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:53.183
owner of Denny Moe's
Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:57.437
I've been lucky enough to have Denny
as my barber for the last eight years.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.221
He said to me once,

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:02.294
"Hey Doc, you know,

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:06.714
lots of black men trust their barbers
more than they trust their doctors."

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.937
This was stunning to me,

00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:11.126
at first,

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:13.689
but not so much when you think about it.

00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.587
Black men have been with their
current barbers

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:19.612
on average as long
as I've been with Denny,

00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:20.864
about eight years.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:25.825
And black men see their barbers
about every two weeks.

00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.444
Not only do you trust your barber
with your look and with your style,

00:06:31.468 --> 00:06:35.374
but you also trust him with your secrets
and sometimes your life.

00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.819
Denny, like many barbers,
is more than just an artist,

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:43.049
a businessman and confidant.

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:48.874
He's a leader and a passionate advocate
for the well-being of his community.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.947
The very first time I walked
into Denny Moe's shop,

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:55.453
he wasn't just cutting hair.

00:06:56.445 --> 00:07:00.198
He was also orchestrating
a voter registration drive

00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:04.119
to give a voice to his customers
and his community.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.111
With this kind of activism,

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:13.443
and community investment
that typifies the black barbershop,

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:17.015
of course the barbershop
is a perfect place

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.952
to talk about high blood pressure and
other health concerns in the community.

00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:26.094
First, the barbershop is not
a medical setting,

00:07:26.118 --> 00:07:29.363
and so it doesn't have
all the negative psychological baggage

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:30.777
that comes along with that.

00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:33.483
When you're in a barbershop,

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:36.936
you're in your territory,
and you're among friends

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.222
who share your history,

00:07:39.246 --> 00:07:42.659
your struggle and your health risks.

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:47.369
Second, because the barbershop
is a place of connection,

00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:49.895
loyalty and trust,

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:53.428
it's a place where you're more open
to have a conversation about health

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.475
and especially about high blood pressure.

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:57.635
After all,

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:01.873
conversations about high blood pressure
have all the elements of great shop talk:

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.618
stress and high blood pressure,

00:08:05.642 --> 00:08:08.172
food and high blood pressure,

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.833
relationships and high blood pressure,

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.792
and yes, what it's like
to be a black man in America

00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:16.046
and high blood pressure.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:20.918
But you can do more than just talk
about high blood pressure

00:08:20.942 --> 00:08:22.181
in the barbershop.

00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:24.784
You can concretely take action.

00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:30.673
Here we have an opportunity to partner
with the Denny Moe's of the world

00:08:30.697 --> 00:08:34.975
and empower communities
to address the health inequities

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:36.304
that uniquely affect it.

00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:40.824
When high blood pressure screening
expanded from clinics and hospitals

00:08:40.848 --> 00:08:43.975
to communities in the 1960s and '70s,

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:47.356
black physicians like
Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.865
and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:53.964
were at the forefront of bringing
health promotion to community hubs

00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:55.476
in urban black neighborhoods.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:09:00.549
These pioneers paved the way
for my professional journey

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.556
with barbershops and health,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.865
which began in Chicago in medical school.

00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:10.854
The very first research project
that I worked on as a medical student

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:13.378
was to help design
healthcare interventions

00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:15.675
that would appeal to black men.

00:09:16.844 --> 00:09:19.727
We conducted about a dozen focus groups

00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:23.026
with a broad cross-section of black men,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.164
and we learned that for them,

00:09:25.188 --> 00:09:29.571
being healthy was as much about
being perceived as healthy

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:31.843
as it was about feeling healthy,

00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:36.120
and that feeling good
went hand in hand with looking good.

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:41.858
This work led to the development
of Project Brotherhood,

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:44.787
a community clinic founded
by Dr. Eric Whitaker

00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:47.604
that provided tailored
healthcare to black men.

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:50.723
Part of this tailored care

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:53.548
involved having a barber on the premises

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:57.175
to reward the men who came
for needed healthcare

00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:59.164
with a free haircut,

00:09:59.188 --> 00:10:03.134
to let the men know that we, too,
valued how they looked

00:10:03.158 --> 00:10:05.028
as well as how they felt,

00:10:05.052 --> 00:10:09.234
and that what was important to them
was also important to us.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.548
But while there's only one
Project Brotherhood,

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:16.893
there are thousands of black barbershops

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:21.393
where the intersection of health
and haircuts can be cultivated.

00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:26.154
The next stop on my journey
was Dallas, Texas,

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:29.195
where we learned that barbers
were not only willing

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:33.258
but fully able to roll up
their sleeves and participate

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:38.806
in delivering needed health services
to improve the health of their customers

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.084
and their community.

00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:44.389
We teamed up with an amazing
cadre of black barbers

00:10:44.413 --> 00:10:46.557
and taught them how
to measure blood pressure

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.362
and how to counsel their customers

00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:50.213
and refer them to doctors

00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:52.081
to help manage high blood pressure.

00:10:52.977 --> 00:10:55.239
The barbers were not only willing to do it

00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.731
but they were damn good at it.

00:10:57.794 --> 00:10:59.748
Over a three-year period,

00:10:59.772 --> 00:11:02.716
the barbers measured
thousands of blood pressures

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.541
resulting in hundreds of black men
being referred to doctors

00:11:07.565 --> 00:11:10.645
for medical care
of their high blood pressure.

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:14.144
These barber-doctor partnerships

00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:18.652
resulted in a 20 percent increase
in the number of men

00:11:18.676 --> 00:11:21.469
who were able to achieve
target blood pressure levels

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:23.953
and a three-point drop, on average,

00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:25.977
in the blood pressure of each participant.

00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:29.389
If we were to extrapolate
that three point drop

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:32.818
to every single black man
with high blood pressure in America,

00:11:32.842 --> 00:11:39.089
we would prevent 800 heart attacks,
500 strokes and 900 deaths

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:40.971
from high blood pressure

00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:42.897
in just one year.

00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:49.024
And our experience with barbershops
has been no different in New York City,

00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:50.897
where my journey has currently led me.

00:11:51.722 --> 00:11:55.666
With an incredible team
of diverse research assistants,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.816
community health workers and volunteers,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.241
we've been able to partner
with over 200 barbershops

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:04.749
and other trusted community venues

00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:08.034
to reach over 7,000 older black men.

00:12:08.564 --> 00:12:11.477
And we've offered high blood pressure
screening and counseling

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.937
to each and every one of them.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.495
Thanks to Denny Moe

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.122
and the myriad other barbers
and community leaders

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:24.090
who shared the vision of opportunity
and empowerment

00:12:24.114 --> 00:12:26.820
to make a difference in their communities,

00:12:26.844 --> 00:12:29.599
we've been able to not only
lower blood pressure

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.083
in our participants,

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:34.819
but we've also been able to impact
other health indicators.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.622
So what do you see?

00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:43.202
What is your barbershop?

00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:48.543
Where is that place for you

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:52.503
where people who are affected
by a unique problem

00:12:53.123 --> 00:12:54.908
can meet a unique solution?

00:12:57.567 --> 00:13:01.682
When you find that place,
see the opportunity.

00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:03.754
Thank you.

00:13:03.778 --> 00:13:07.222
(Applause)
