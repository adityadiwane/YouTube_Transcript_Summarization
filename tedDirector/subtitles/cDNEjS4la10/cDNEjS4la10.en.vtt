00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
which are the two primary factors --

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
bordering on the inevitable at this point,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
whether one is in favor of that or not --

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
better conceptualized as kinds of technology,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.160
and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
in the space of conceptual design.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Here's what I mean. Politics and --

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
let's focus on the political system in particular question here,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
which is the system of democracy.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
for the control and deployment of power.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one;

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
to do it in a radically diffused fashion;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
and democracy is a set of technologies,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
which have the effect of, in principle,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
diffusing the power source to a large number of people

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
by virtue of what the broader public has done.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Now, consider religion -- in this case Islam,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
which is the religion that, in some direct sense,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
At the beginning of the Bush administration,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
After 9/11, the tables were turned.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And the president decided, with his advisors,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
That began with Afghanistan,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
a decision was made through the technology of democracy --

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
again, notice, not a perfect technology --

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
but through the technology of democracy

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
this time, a war in Iraq.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war"

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
is that we have to acknowledge that Islam,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.160
as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
and as a consequence, at one degree of remove,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And I would add that bin Laden and his followers

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and the world of Islam as they see and define it.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160
in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
but it's also meant by the Islamists --

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Within the sphere of people who have that view,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
who disagree with bin Laden in his application,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
but agree that Islam is the answer.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Islam represents a way of engaging the world

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
peace, justice and equality,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
by identifying either of these propositions --

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
And I think a good way to prove this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
you can't show a picture of democracy.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160
You can show the Capitol --

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
I had the same problem when I was designing the cover

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
of my forthcoming book, in fact --

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
what do you put on the cover to show democracy?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
And the same problem with respect to Islam.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
That's because these are the kinds of concepts

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
that are not susceptible to easy representation.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Now, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
It follows from that that all of the people in the world

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
who say that they are Muslims can, in principle,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
In other words, unlike the word hope,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160
which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
these are essentially contested concepts.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.160
They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
And as a consequence of this disagreement,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
"I have the right version of Islam."

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Well, so says George W. Bush.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Other people would say it means something else.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Some people would say that Islam means submission.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Other people would say it means an acknowledgement

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
or recognition of God's sovereignty.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Other people say no, that's not enough,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean."

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Now, if Islam and democracy are at present

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
in a moment of great confrontation,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
what does that mean?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
which was fear.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
as a consequence of this confrontation --

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
a confrontation which many, many people

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
in the Muslim world do not want,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
many, many people in the American democracy do not want,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
many people elsewhere in the world do not want,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.160
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
is that there's also a hopeful response to this.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
that Islam and democracy are technologies.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
And they're manipulable in ways

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
What do I have in mind?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
or just a source of powerful personal identity,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.160
disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly --

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
and one can find this by reading any of the sources

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:11.160
that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
to have choice in the spheres of personal life,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
and, yes, in the sphere of religion,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And many of these Muslims further say

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
that their disagreement with the United States

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
is that it, in the past and still in the present,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.160
in order to promote America's short-term interests.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
Now, during the Cold War, that may have been

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
a defensible position for the United States to take.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
That's an academic question.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
But now that the Cold War is over,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and pretty close to the same here in the United States,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
if you talk to people and ask them --

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
And we see this among activist, practical Muslims,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
like the Muslims who are presently the elected,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
who are promoting their own religious values,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
who are elected by their own people

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
because they were perceived as honest and sincere

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
because of their religious values,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.160
but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
are fundamentally incompatible.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
with what we consider the core of democracy --

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
But I'm here to tell you that technologies

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
are more malleable than that.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and basic human equality before God,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.160
And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.160
So, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
try to form a party known as the Center Party,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
They weren't even allowed to form a party.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
They were actually blocked from even forming a party

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
under the political system there. Why?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Because they would have done extraordinarily well.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
In the most recent elections in the Muslim world --

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
and those in Turkey -- in each case,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.160
people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
were far and away the most successful vote-getters

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.160
every place they were allowed to run freely.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
So had they contested a larger number of the seats,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
they would have done even better.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160
is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
who care very, very deeply about their traditions,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
who do not want to compromise those values --

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160
believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160
and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
that these two ideas can work together.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Now what would that look like?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
to democracy as we know it in the United States.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160
for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
or Muslims out in the rest of the world --

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
conceptualize Islam.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
It will be transformative of Islam as well.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
And as a result of this convergence,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160
this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
we'll in fact have close compatibility.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
if you're talking about these issues.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
many Muslims will conclude that the United States

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
is not the kind of place that they want to emulate

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
with respect to its forms of political government.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.160
swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
that Islam is the enemy somehow --

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
And even though, for political tactical reasons,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
to think of the other side as an enemy.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.160
And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
in defining who that enemy is.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
So the risks are very great.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:30.160
On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
are also not to be underestimated,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
even by, and I would say especially by, people

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
it cannot be the right strategy,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:51.160
either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
because we opposed the war in the first place."

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
That's not the way human circumstances operate.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
You face the circumstances you have in front of you

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
and you go forward.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
Well, what I'm here to say then is,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
for people who are skeptical about the war,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
there is a possibility for the government of the United States

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
to create real forms of government that are truly democratic

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and also truly Islamic.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160
And it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
for people who care about these issues to make sure

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
that within the technology of democracy, in this system,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
to encourage that outcome.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
That's a hopeful message,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
as incurring serious obligation for all of us.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
but only if we put what we can into it.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.160
And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Thanks.
