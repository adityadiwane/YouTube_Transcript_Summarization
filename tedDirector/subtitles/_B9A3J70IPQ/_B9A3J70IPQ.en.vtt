00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.567
A long time ago,

00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.339
I was a professional animator.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.543
(Music)

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:21.473
[Eric Dyer]

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:22.507
[Animator]

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:23.681
[Compositor]

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:29.971
And at night,

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.278
I would make my own experimental films.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:33.355
(Music)

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.010
And I was spending a lot of time,
way too much time, in front of a screen

00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:40.729
for work that would be
presented on a screen,

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:44.476
and I had this great need
to get my hands back on the work again.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.281
Now, before "The Simpsons,"

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:49.461
before "Gumby,"

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:51.163
before "Betty Boop,"

00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:54.643
before there was such a thing
as cinema and television,

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.591
animation was hugely popular in this form.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:00:59.246
This is a zoetrope.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.051
And you spin this drum,

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.944
and you look through the slits
into the inside of the drum,

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:06.093
and you see the animation pop to life.

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:09.310
This is animation in physical form,

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:12.617
and it's animation I could
get my hands on again.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.110
I took these ideas to Denmark.

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:17.988
I went there with my family
on a Fulbright Fellowship.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.175
That's my daughter, Mia.

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.232
I rode around the city on my bicycle

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:28.595
and shot all the interesting
moving elements of Copenhagen:

00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:32.708
the boaters in the canals,

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.940
the colors that explode in spring,

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.164
the free-use city bikes,

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:39.880
love,

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:41.677
textures,

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:43.495
the healthy cuisine --

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:44.669
(Laughter)

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.701
And I brought all that video
back into the physical world

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:52.415
by printing it out on these long
strips of ink-jet paper

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.747
and cutting out the forms.

00:01:54.154 --> 00:01:57.488
Now, I invented my own
form of the zoetrope,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.689
which removes the drum

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:06.508
and replaces the slits
with a video camera.

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:10.587
And this was very exciting for me,

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:14.795
because it meant that I could
make these physical objects,

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.166
and I could make films from those objects.

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.167
That's me riding on my bicycle.

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:21.341
(Laughter)

00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:30.995
I made about 25 paper sculptures,

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.016
each the size of a bicycle wheel.

00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.517
I brought them into the studio,

00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.731
spun them

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:40.999
and shot them to make the film
"Copenhagen Cycles."

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.884
(Music)

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:53.534
This project not only allowed me
to get my hands back on the work again

00:02:53.558 --> 00:02:55.460
but it helped me get my life back.

00:02:56.016 --> 00:03:01.429
Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day
with my face plastered to a screen,

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:05.012
I was having these little adventures
with our new family

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:07.796
and shooting video along the way,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.941
and it was kind of a symbiosis
of art and life.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.548
And I think that it's no mistake

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:17.398
that zoetrope translates
into "wheel of life."

00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:21.422
(Music)

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.494
But film and video does flatten sculpture,

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:27.546
so I tried to imagine

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.498
a way that animated sculpture
could be experienced as such,

00:03:31.522 --> 00:03:35.569
and also a completely immersive
kind of animated sculpture.

00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:39.263
And that's where I came up with the idea
for the zoetrope tunnel.

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.743
You walk through with a handheld strobe,

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.859
and wherever you point the flashlight,

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.360
the animation pops to life.

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:49.523
I plan to finish this project
in the next 30 to 40 years.

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:50.697
(Laughter)

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.933
But I did build a half-scale prototype.

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.983
It's covered in Velcro,

00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.523
and I could lay inside on this bridge

00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:04.869
and stick animated sequences to the walls

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.133
and test stuff out.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.238
People would comment
that it reminded them of an MRI.

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:16.178
And that medical connection spoke to me,

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:17.723
because at the age of 14,

00:04:17.747 --> 00:04:20.320
I was diagnosed with
a degenerative retinal condition

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.826
that's slowly taking my vision away,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.315
and I'd never responded
to that in my work.

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:29.610
So I responded to it
in this piece called, "Implant."

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.733
It is an imaginary,
super-magnified medical device

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:36.760
that fits around the optic nerve.

00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:42.451
And the public is, in a sense,
miniaturized to experience it.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.771
With a handheld strobe,

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:52.853
they can explore the sculpture,

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:57.843
and discover thousands
of cell-sized robots

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:01.147
hard at work, leaping
in and out of the optic nerve,

00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:02.571
being deployed to the retina

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:03.745
to repair it.

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:08.572
It's my science fiction fantasy cure
of my own incurable disorder.

00:05:08.596 --> 00:05:10.538
(Machine buzzes)

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:15.505
Now, in the real-world gene therapy
and gene therapy research,

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.130
healthy genes are being administered
to unhealthy cells using viruses.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.822
There's a lot of colorful,
fluffy hope in this,

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:28.225
and there's also some creepy,
threatening idea

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.355
of viruses maybe becoming
an invasive species in your body.

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:39.875
Vision loss has helped
to take me away from the things

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.162
that disconnect me from the world.

00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:45.358
Instead of being sealed off
in an automobile,

00:05:45.382 --> 00:05:47.055
I ride my bike,

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.717
take buses and trains

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:50.139
and walk a lot.

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:55.559
And instead of a visually intensive
process in the studio, primarily,

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:58.169
I'm also getting outdoors a lot more

00:05:58.193 --> 00:05:59.941
and using more of my senses.

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:05.599
This landscape is a couple hours east
of San Diego, California.

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:07.268
My brother lives out that way.

00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:11.313
He and I went camping there for four days.

00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:14.485
And I grabbed my camera,

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.435
and I walked through the canyons.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.505
And I tried to imagine and figure out

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.627
what kind of motion would be present

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:27.205
in this place that was so still
and so devoid of motion.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.478
I think it's the stillest
place I've ever been.

00:06:30.153 --> 00:06:35.330
And I realized that it was the movement
of my own body through the landscape

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.015
that was creating the animation.

00:06:37.426 --> 00:06:39.651
It was the motion of changing perspective.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.613
So I created this piece called "Mud Caves"
from those photographs.

00:06:44.162 --> 00:06:46.637
It's a multilayered print piece,

00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.304
and you can think of it as
a zoetrope laid flat.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.361
It's kind of my western
landscape panorama.

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.989
And next to the print piece
there's a video monitor

00:06:57.013 --> 00:07:00.492
that shows the animation
hidden within the artwork.

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:03.819
I think one of the best parts
about this project for me

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:06.502
was that I got to hang out
with my brother a lot,

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:09.067
who lives 2,500 miles away from me.

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:14.257
And we would just sit
in this seemingly eternal landscape

00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:17.057
sculpted by water over millions of years

00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:18.231
and talk.

00:07:18.747 --> 00:07:20.922
We'd talk about our kids growing up

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:23.507
and the slowing pace of our parents,

00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:28.648
and our dad who's suffering from leukemia,
memory loss and infection.

00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:32.293
And it struck me that, as individuals,

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:33.890
we're finite,

00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:35.366
but as a family,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.508
we are an ongoing cycle --

00:07:37.532 --> 00:07:39.399
a kind of wheel of life.

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:44.639
Now, I want to leave you with a tribute
to one of my mentors.

00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:50.815
She reminds me that physical
presence is important

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.193
and that play is not a luxury,

00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:55.501
but a necessity.

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:03.773
She's Pixie,

00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:06.953
and she's our family dog.

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:12.566
And she loves to jump.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.970
(Dog barking)

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.457
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:23.101
And this is a new kind of zoetrope

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.404
that I developed
at the Imaging Research Center

00:08:25.428 --> 00:08:26.948
at UMBC in Baltimore.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.148
And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."

00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:33.755
(Dog barking)

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.145
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.701
Thank you.

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:39.878
(Applause)
