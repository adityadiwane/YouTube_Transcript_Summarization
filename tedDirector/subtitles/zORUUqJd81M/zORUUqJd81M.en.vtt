00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:15.001
Why does the universe exist?

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.996
Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter)

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:21.838
This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.414
Why is there a world, why are we in it,

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:27.293
and why is there something rather than nothing at all?

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.939
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.174
So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:35.730
the puzzle of existence,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.644
where we are now in addressing it,

00:00:38.644 --> 00:00:40.894
and why you should care,

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.810
and I hope you do care.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.636
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:49.416
those who don't wonder about
the contingency of their existence,

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.273
of the contingency of the world's existence,

00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:53.936
are mentally deficient.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:57.883
That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)

00:00:57.883 --> 00:00:59.560
So this has been called the most sublime

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.854
and awesome mystery,

00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:04.523
the deepest and most far-reaching question

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:05.583
man can pose.

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.297
It's obsessed great thinkers.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:08.901
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.231
philosopher of the 20th century,

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.714
was astonished that there should be a world at all.

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.718
He wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,

00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:20.408
"It is not how things are in the world

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:21.760
that is the mystical,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.095
it's that the world exists."

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.313
And if you don't like taking your epigrams

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:29.224
from a philosopher, try a scientist.

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:31.825
John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.051
of the 20th century,

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.976
the teacher of Richard Feynman,

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:37.636
the coiner of the term "black hole,"

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:40.059
he said, "I want to know

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:41.792
how come the quantum,

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.936
how come the universe, how come existence?"

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:46.935
And my friend Martin Amis —

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.612
sorry that I'll be doing a lot of
name-dropping in this talk,

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:50.987
so get used to it —

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:55.963
my dear friend Martin Amis once said

00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:59.183
that we're about five Einsteins away from answering

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:01.219
the mystery of where the universe came from.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.200
And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.387
in the audience tonight.

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:06.890
Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.052
No Einsteins? Okay.

00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:12.274
So this question, why is there
something rather than nothing,

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:14.242
this sublime question, was posed rather late

00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:16.552
in intellectual history.

00:02:16.552 --> 00:02:19.031
It was towards the end of the 17th century,

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:21.993
the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.736
a very smart guy, Leibniz,

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:25.886
who invented the calculus

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:28.740
independently of Isaac Newton,
at about the same time,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.342
but for Leibniz, who asked why is
there something rather than nothing,

00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:33.535
this was not a great mystery.

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:35.931
He either was or pretended to be

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:38.687
an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,

00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:41.702
and he said it's obvious why the world exists:

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:44.164
because God created it.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.449
And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.960
That's how powerful God is.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.602
He doesn't need any preexisting
materials to fashion a world out of.

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:54.762
He can make it out of sheer nothingness,

00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:56.236
creation ex nihilo.

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:57.181
And by the way, this is what

00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.020
most Americans today believe.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.734
There is no mystery of existence for them.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.302
God made it.

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:05.888
So let's put this in an equation.

00:03:05.888 --> 00:03:08.515
I don't have any slides so
I'm going to mime my visuals,

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:09.950
so use your imaginations.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.804
So it's God + nothing = the world.

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:19.118
Okay? Now that's the equation.

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:20.851
And so maybe you don't believe in God.

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:22.681
Maybe you're a scientific atheist

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.015
or an unscientific atheist,
and you don't believe in God,

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:27.433
and you're not happy with it.

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.137
By the way, even if we have this equation,

00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:32.039
God + nothing = the world,

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.725
there's already a problem:

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.759
Why does God exist?

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.962
God doesn't exist by logic alone

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:40.775
unless you believe the ontological argument,

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:43.102
and I hope you don't, because
it's not a good argument.

00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:46.263
So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,

00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:49.413
he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.843
but where did I come from?

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:54.013
(Laughter)

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:55.432
Whence then am I?

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:58.640
God speaks in a more formal English.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.629
(Laughter)

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.677
And so one theory is that God was so bored with

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.466
pondering the puzzle of His own existence

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:08.388
that He created the world just to distract himself.

00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:10.500
But anyway, let's forget about God.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.857
Take God out of the equation: We have

00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:14.980
________ + nothing = the world.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.761
Now, if you're a Buddhist,

00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:18.505
you might want to stop right there,

00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:20.474
because essentially what you've got is

00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:22.050
nothing = the world,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.563
and by symmetry of identity, that means

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.918
the world = nothing. Okay?

00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:28.337
And to a Buddhist, the world
is just a whole lot of nothing.

00:04:28.337 --> 00:04:31.443
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:33.995
And we think there's a lot of something out there

00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.560
but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.271
If we let our desires melt away,

00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:42.151
we'll see the world for what it truly is,

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:44.131
a vacuity, nothingness,

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.313
and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana

00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:48.136
which has been defined as having

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:51.454
just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)

00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:53.333
So that's the Buddhist thinking.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:56.832
But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned

00:04:56.832 --> 00:04:58.815
with the puzzle of existence, so I've got

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.423
________ + —

00:05:00.423 --> 00:05:02.581
this is going to get serious in a minute, so —

00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.607
________ + nothing = the world.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:06.830
What are we going to put in that blank?

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.678
Well, how about science?

00:05:08.678 --> 00:05:12.229
Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.244
and the most fundamental science is physics.

00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:18.214
That tells us what naked reality really is,

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:20.840
that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.830
the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.482
So maybe physics can fill this blank,

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:31.544
and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,

00:05:31.544 --> 00:05:35.207
physicists have purported to give

00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:38.327
a purely scientific explanation of how

00:05:38.327 --> 00:05:41.322
a universe like ours could have popped into existence

00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:43.201
out of sheer nothingness,

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.281
a quantum fluctuation out of the void.

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.339
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.645
more recently Alex Vilenkin,

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:52.378
and the whole thing has been popularized

00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:54.571
by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,

00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:57.103
Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called

00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:59.229
"A Universe from Nothing,"

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.445
and Lawrence thinks that he's given —

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.526
he's a militant atheist, by the way,

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.150
so he's gotten God out of the picture.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.531
The laws of quantum field theory,

00:06:07.531 --> 00:06:09.432
the state-of-the-art physics, can show how

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:10.750
out of sheer nothingness,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.975
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,

00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:16.420
a little nugget of false vacuum

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.393
can fluctuate into existence,

00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:20.375
and then, by the miracle of inflation,

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:23.460
blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.215
we see around us.

00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:28.769
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:31.537
It's very speculative. It's fascinating.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:33.865
But I've got a big problem with it,

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.750
and the problem is this:

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.221
It's a pseudo-religious point of view.

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.217
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,

00:06:39.217 --> 00:06:41.965
but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.

00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:46.734
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.

00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:48.784
The laws of quantum field theory for him

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.395
are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:55.834
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout

00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:57.941
that they can form the abyss,

00:06:57.941 --> 00:06:59.781
that it's pregnant with being.

00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.688
They can call a world into existence out of nothing.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.635
But that's a very primitive view of what

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:06.108
a physical law is, right?

00:07:06.108 --> 00:07:09.363
We know that physical laws are actually

00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:12.407
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities

00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:13.612
in the world.

00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:15.985
They don't exist outside the world.

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:17.965
They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.

00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.960
They can't call a world into existence

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.278
out of nothingness.

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:22.809
That's a very primitive view

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.993
of what a scientific law is.

00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:26.988
And if you don't believe me on this,

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.790
listen to Stephen Hawking,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.825
who himself put forward a model of the cosmos

00:07:32.825 --> 00:07:33.901
that was self-contained,

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:37.539
didn't require any outside cause, any creator,

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:39.267
and after proposing this,

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.681
Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.993
He said, this model is just equations.

00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:47.852
What breathes fire into the equations

00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:50.774
and creates a world for them to describe?

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:51.907
He was puzzled by this,

00:07:51.907 --> 00:07:55.712
so equations themselves can't do the magic,

00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:57.850
can't resolve the puzzle of existence.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.763
And besides, even if the laws could do that,

00:08:00.763 --> 00:08:02.586
why this set of laws?

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.150
Why quantum field theory that describes

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.850
a universe with a certain number of forces

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.899
and particles and so forth?

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:10.190
Why not a completely different set of laws?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.478
There are many, many mathematically
consistent sets of laws.

00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:16.917
Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.649
So this is a problem, believe it or not,

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:21.647
that reflective physicists really think a lot about,

00:08:21.647 --> 00:08:24.755
and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.970
say, well, maybe the set of laws

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.217
that describes our universe,

00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.952
it's just one set of laws

00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:31.988
and it describes one part of reality,

00:08:31.988 --> 00:08:34.784
but maybe every consistent set of laws

00:08:34.784 --> 00:08:36.570
describes another part of reality,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.503
and in fact all possible physical worlds

00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:42.954
really exist, they're all out there.

00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:45.237
We just see a little tiny part of reality

00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:47.780
that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.512
but there are many, many other worlds,

00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:51.278
parts of reality that are described

00:08:51.278 --> 00:08:53.235
by vastly different theories

00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:56.251
that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,

00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.996
that are inconceivably exotic.

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:01.733
Steven Weinberg, the father

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:04.174
of the standard model of particle physics,

00:09:04.174 --> 00:09:07.000
has actually flirted with this idea himself,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.243
that all possible realities actually exist.

00:09:11.243 --> 00:09:14.332
Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,

00:09:14.332 --> 00:09:18.708
who believes that all mathematical structures exist,

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.845
and mathematical existence is the same thing

00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:22.612
as physical existence,

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:24.930
so we have this vastly rich multiverse

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.371
that encompasses every logical possibility.

00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:31.881
Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,

00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:34.153
these physicists and also philosophers are actually

00:09:34.153 --> 00:09:36.675
reaching back to a very old idea

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:38.132
that goes back to Plato.

00:09:38.132 --> 00:09:41.330
It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.243
or the great chain of being,

00:09:43.243 --> 00:09:47.110
that reality is actually as full as possible.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.811
It's as far removed from nothingness

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.706
as it could possibly be.

00:09:51.706 --> 00:09:54.200
So we have these two extremes now.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.499
We have sheer nothingness on one side,

00:09:57.499 --> 00:09:59.997
and we have this vision of a reality

00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:03.180
that encompasses every conceivable world

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.909
at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,

00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:08.802
nothingness, the simplest possible reality.

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:11.681
Now what's in between these two extremes?

00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.708
There are all kinds of intermediate realities

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:16.655
that include some things and leave out others.

00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:18.251
So one of these intermediate realities

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:23.946
is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,

00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:25.621
that leaves out the inelegant bits,

00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.267
the ugly asymmetries and so forth.

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:30.593
Now, there are some physicists who will tell you

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:34.227
that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:37.174
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,

00:10:37.174 --> 00:10:40.787
and he has written a book
called "The Elegant Universe."

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.058
He claims that the universe we live in mathematically

00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:44.767
is very elegant.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:46.450
Don't believe him. (Laughter)

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.537
It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,

00:10:49.537 --> 00:10:51.450
but I think the other day he admitted to me

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.514
it's really an ugly universe.

00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:55.890
It's stupidly constructed,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.144
it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants

00:10:59.144 --> 00:11:00.810
and mass ratios

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.588
and superfluous families of elementary particles,

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:05.736
and what the hell is dark energy?

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:09.135
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.138
It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.881
And then there's the best of all possible worlds

00:11:15.881 --> 00:11:17.471
in an ethical sense.

00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:18.650
You should get solemn now,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.845
because a world in which sentient beings

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:23.465
don't suffer needlessly,

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.334
in which there aren't things like

00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:27.549
childhood cancer or the Holocaust.

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:28.800
This is an ethical conception.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.865
Anyway, so between nothingness

00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:32.498
and the fullest possible reality,

00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:34.043
various special realities.

00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:36.323
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.

00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:39.833
Then there's the most elegant possible reality.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.197
That's special.

00:11:41.197 --> 00:11:43.849
The fullest possible reality, that's special.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.365
But what are we leaving out here?

00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:48.101
There's also just the crummy,

00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:49.856
generic realities

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:52.477
that aren't special in any way,

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:54.029
that are sort of random.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:56.756
They're infinitely removed from nothingness,

00:11:56.756 --> 00:12:00.682
but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.

00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:03.202
They're a mixture of chaos and order,

00:12:03.202 --> 00:12:07.400
of mathematical elegance and ugliness.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.185
So I would describe these realities

00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:13.312
as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,

00:12:13.312 --> 00:12:16.692
a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.

00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:18.876
And these realities,

00:12:18.876 --> 00:12:21.142
is there a deity in any of these realities?

00:12:21.142 --> 00:12:23.553
Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:25.889
like the Judeo-Christian deity.

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:29.196
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.

00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:32.527
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent

00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:34.630
but only 80 percent effective,

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:40.767
which pretty much describes the world
we see around us, I think. (Laughter)

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:43.499
So I would like to propose that the resolution

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:45.335
to the mystery of existence

00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:49.425
is that the reality we exist in

00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:51.481
is one of these generic realities.

00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:54.136
Reality has to turn out some way.

00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:56.206
It can either turn out to be nothing

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:59.887
or everything or something in between.

00:12:59.887 --> 00:13:03.578
So if it has some special feature,

00:13:03.578 --> 00:13:05.768
like being really elegant or really full

00:13:05.768 --> 00:13:07.376
or really simple, like nothingness,

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:09.177
that would require an explanation.

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:12.336
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,

00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:14.486
there's no further explanation for it.

00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:15.870
And indeed, I would say

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.850
that's the reality we live in.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.107
That's what science is telling us.

00:13:20.107 --> 00:13:21.438
At the beginning of the week,

00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:24.554
we got the exciting information that

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.693
the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,

00:13:27.693 --> 00:13:31.663
infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,

00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:35.488
it's like a big frothing champagne

00:13:35.488 --> 00:13:38.172
coming out of a bottle endlessly,

00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:40.264
a vast universe, mostly a wasteland

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:44.530
with little pockets of charm and order and peace,

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.895
this has been confirmed,

00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.797
this inflationary scenario, by the observations

00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:51.890
made by radio telescopes in Antarctica

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.713
that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves

00:13:54.713 --> 00:13:56.637
from just before the Big Bang.

00:13:56.637 --> 00:13:58.482
I'm sure you all know about this.

00:13:58.482 --> 00:14:01.306
So anyway, I think there's some evidence

00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:04.793
that this really is the reality that we're stuck with.

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:07.900
Now, why should you care?

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.136
Well — (Laughter) —

00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:12.560
the question, "Why does the world exist?"

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.239
that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:15.693
with a more intimate question:

00:14:15.693 --> 00:14:18.776
Why do I exist? Why do you exist?

00:14:18.776 --> 00:14:22.376
you know, our existence would
seem to be amazingly improbable,

00:14:22.376 --> 00:14:26.695
because there's an enormous number
of genetically possible humans,

00:14:26.695 --> 00:14:28.099
if you can compute it by looking at

00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:30.441
the number of the genes and the
number of alleles and so forth,

00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:32.737
and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you

00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:34.892
there are about 10 to the 10,000th

00:14:34.892 --> 00:14:36.552
possible humans, genetically.

00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:40.020
That's between a googol and a googolplex.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.636
And the number of the actual
humans that have existed

00:14:41.636 --> 00:14:44.130
is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.195
an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,

00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:48.125
we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.

00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:50.244
We're here. Okay.

00:14:50.244 --> 00:14:53.165
So what kind of reality do we want to live in?

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:55.415
Do we want to live in a special reality?

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:59.644
What if we were living in the
most elegant possible reality?

00:14:59.644 --> 00:15:02.153
Imagine the existential pressure on us

00:15:02.153 --> 00:15:03.992
to live up to that, to be elegant,

00:15:03.992 --> 00:15:05.858
not to pull down the tone of it.

00:15:05.858 --> 00:15:08.939
Or, what if we were living
in the fullest possible reality?

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:10.950
Well then our existence would be guaranteed,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.728
because every possible thing

00:15:12.728 --> 00:15:14.094
exists in that reality,

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:16.255
but our choices would be meaningless.

00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:19.250
If I really struggle morally and agonize

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.330
and I decide to do the right thing,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.525
what difference does it make,

00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:24.550
because there are an infinite number

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.564
of versions of me

00:15:25.564 --> 00:15:26.961
also doing the right thing

00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.616
and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.

00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:30.456
So my choices are meaningless.

00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:32.740
So we don't want to live in that special reality.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.327
And as for the special reality of nothingness,

00:15:35.327 --> 00:15:37.554
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

00:15:37.554 --> 00:15:44.489
So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,

00:15:44.489 --> 00:15:46.385
there are nasty bits and nice bits

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:47.927
and we could make the nice bits bigger

00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:50.266
and the nasty bits smaller

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:53.157
and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.

00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:54.563
The universe is absurd,

00:15:54.563 --> 00:15:56.290
but we can still construct a purpose,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.230
and that's a pretty good one,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.895
and the overall mediocrity of reality

00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:02.500
kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.812
we all feel in the core of our being.

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:06.446
And I know you feel it.

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:07.550
I know you're all special,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.872
but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,

00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:11.261
don't you think?

00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:13.198
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:17.250
So anyway, you may say, this 
puzzle, the mystery of existence,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.668
it's just silly mystery-mongering.

00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:22.535
You're not astonished at the existence of the universe

00:16:22.535 --> 00:16:24.170
and you're in good company.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.386
Bertrand Russell said,

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:30.041
"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."

00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.442
Just a brute fact.

00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:34.276
And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:35.985
a great philosophical wag,

00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:37.602
when I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,

00:16:37.602 --> 00:16:40.098
why is there something rather than nothing?"

00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:42.248
And he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,

00:16:42.248 --> 00:16:44.244
you still wouldn't be satisfied."

00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:47.993
So — (Laughter) — okay.

00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:50.355
So you're not astonished. I don't care.

00:16:50.355 --> 00:16:53.328
But I will tell you something to conclude

00:16:53.328 --> 00:16:55.606
that I guarantee you will astonish you,

00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:58.273
because it's astonished all of the brilliant,

00:16:58.273 --> 00:17:00.586
wonderful people I've met at this TED conference,

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.800
when I've told them, and it's this:

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.302
Never in my life have I had a cell phone.
