00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.860
I want to give you a new perspective.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.660
That sounds grandiose, and it is.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.100
I left Ireland yesterday morning.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.156
I traveled from Dublin to New York

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.380
independently.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.796
But the design of an airport,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.356
plane and terminal

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.300
offers little independence when
you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.260
For Americans, that's 3' 5".

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.220
I was whisked through the airport
by airline assistants in a wheelchair.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.820
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.596
but the design of an airport

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.876
and its lack of accessibility

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.980
means that it's my only way
to get through.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.836
With my carry-on bag between my feet,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.236
I was wheeled through
security, preclearance

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.620
and I arrived at my boarding gate.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.556
I use the accessibility
services in the airport

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.820
because most of the terminal
is just not designed with me in mind.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.460
Take security, for example.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.236
I'm not strong enough
to lift my carry-on bag

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.300
from the ground to the carousel.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.900
I stand at eye level with it.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.316
And those who work in that space
for safety purposes cannot help me

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.020
and cannot do it for me.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.780
Design inhibits my autonomy
and my independence.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.300
But traveling at this size,
it isn't all bad.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.556
The leg room in economy
is like business class.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.460
(Laughter)

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.660
I often forget that I'm a little person.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.140
It's the physical environment
and society that remind me.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.900
Using a public bathroom
is an excruciating experience.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.876
I walk into the cubicle

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.758
but I can't reach the lock on the door.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.060
I'm creative and resilient.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.220
I look around and see if there's
a bin that I can turn upside down.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.420
Is it safe?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.060
Not really.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.780
Is it hygienic and sanitary?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.460
Definitely not.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.200
But the alternative is much worse.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.060
If that doesn't work, I use my phone.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.036
It gives me an additional
four- to six-inch reach,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.740
and I try to jam the lock closed
with my iPhone.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.956
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive
had in mind when he designed the iPhone,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.180
but it works.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.260
The alternative
is that I approach a stranger.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.556
I apologize profusely

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.660
and I ask them to stand guard
outside my cubicle door.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.356
They do

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.340
and I emerge grateful

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.980
but absolutely mortified,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.596
and hope that they didn't notice

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.954
that I left the bathroom
without washing my hands.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.260
I carry hand sanitizer with me
every single day

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.396
because the sink, soap dispenser,
hand dryer and mirror

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.780
are all out of my reach.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.676
Now, the accessible bathroom
is somewhat of an option.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.100
In this space, I can reach
the lock on the door,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.020
the sink, the soap dispenser,
the hand dryer and the mirror.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.140
Yet, I cannot use the toilet.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.796
It is deliberately designed higher

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.980
so that wheelchair users
can transfer across with ease.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380
This is a wonderful
and necessary innovation,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.500
but in the design world, when we describe
a new project or idea as accessible,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.700
what does that mean?

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.660
Who is it accessible to?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.420
And whose needs
are not being accommodated for?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.316
Now, the bathroom is an example

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.860
of where design impinges upon my dignity,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.260
but the physical environment impacts
upon me in much more casual ways too,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.300
something as simple
as ordering a cup of coffee.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.500
Now, I'll admit it.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860
I drink far too much coffee.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.876
My order is a skinny vanilla latte,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.460
but I'm trying
to wean myself off the syrup.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.356
But the coffee shop,
it's not designed well,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.580
at least not for me.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.116
Queuing, I'm standing
beside the pastry cabinet

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.180
and the barista calls for the next order.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.220
"Next, please!" they shout.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.460
They can't see me.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.276
The person next to me in the queue
points to my existence

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.540
and everyone is embarrassed.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.340
I order as quick as I can
and I move along to collect my coffee.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.740
Now, think just for a second.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.580
Where do they put it?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.620
Up high and without a lid.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.196
Reaching up to collect a coffee
that I have paid for

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.660
is an incredibly dangerous experience.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.716
But design also impinges
on the clothes that I want to wear.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.380
I want garments
that reflect my personality.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.820
It's difficult to find
in the childrenswear department.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.740
And often womenswear
requires far too many alterations.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.140
I want shoes that affect my maturity,
professionalism and sophistication.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.220
Instead, I'm offered sneakers
with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.796
Now, I'm not totally opposed
to light-up shoes.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.020
(Laughter)

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.316
But design also impacts
on such simple things,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.780
like sitting on a chair.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.260
I cannot go from a standing
to a seating position with grace.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.396
Due to the standards
of design heights of chairs,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.116
I have to crawl on my hands and knees

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.756
just to get on top of it,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.420
whilst also being conscious
that it might tip over at any stage.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.756
But whilst design impacts on me

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.556
whether it's a chair,
a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.756
I rely on and benefit

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.580
from the kindness of strangers.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.980
But not everybody is so nice.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.796
I'm reminded that I'm a little person

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.260
when a stranger points,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.540
stares,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.340
laughs,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.956
calls me a name,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.460
or takes a photograph of me.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.209
This happens almost every day.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.436
With the rise of social media,
it has given me an opportunity

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.420
and a platform to have a voice
as a blogger and as an activist,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.556
but it has also made me nervous

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.676
that I might become a meme

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.260
or a viral sensation,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.620
all without my consent.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.756
So let's take a moment right now

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.380
to make something very clear.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.940
The word "midget" is a slur.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.300
It evolved from PT Barnum's era
of circuses and freak shows.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.180
Society has evolved.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.860
So should our vocabulary.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.036
Language is a powerful tool.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.060
It does not just name our society.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.980
It shapes it.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.116
I am incredibly proud
to be a little person,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.396
to have inherited
the condition of achondroplasia.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.660
But I am most proud to be Sinead.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.540
Achondroplasia is
the most common form of dwarfism.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.780
Achondroplasia translates
as "without cartilage formation."

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.316
I have short limbs
and achondroplastic facial features,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.660
my forehead and my nose.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.996
My arms do not straighten fully,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.900
but I can lick my elbow.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.841
I'm not showing you that one.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.500
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately
one in every 20,000 births.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.020
80 percent of little people
are born to two average-height parents.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.740
That means that anybody in this room
could have a child with achondroplasia.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.300
Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.980
I'd like to show you a photo of my family.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.116
My mother is average height,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.356
my father is a little person

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.380
and I am the eldest of five children.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.540
I have three sisters and one brother.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.060
They are all average height.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.396
I am incredibly fortunate
to have been born into a family

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.620
that cultivated
my curiosity and my tenacity,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.516
that protected me from the unkindness
and ignorance of strangers

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.716
and that armed me with the resilience,
creativity and confidence

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.380
that I needed to survive and manipulate
the physical environment and society.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.436
If I was to pinpoint any reason
why I am successful,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.580
it is because I was
and I am a loved child,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.276
now, a loved child
with a lot of sass and sarcasm,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.979
but a loved child nonetheless.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.140
In giving you an insight
into who I am today

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.020
I wanted to offer you a new perspective.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.476
I wanted to challenge the idea

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.060
that design is but a tool
to create function and beauty.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.100
Design greatly impacts
upon people's lives,

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.500
all lives.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.876
Design is a way in which
we can feel included in the world,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.156
but it is also a way in which
we can uphold a person's dignity

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.540
and their human rights.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.116
Design can also inflict vulnerability

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.620
on a group whose needs aren't considered.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.980
So today, I want
your perceptions challenged.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.796
Who are we not designing for?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.636
How can we amplify their voices

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.260
and their experiences?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.220
What is the next step?

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.796
Design is an enormous privilege,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.780
but it is a bigger responsibility.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.820
I want you to open your eyes.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.796
Thank you so much.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.580
(Applause)
