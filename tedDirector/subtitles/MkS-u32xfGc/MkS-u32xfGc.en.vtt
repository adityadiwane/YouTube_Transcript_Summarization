00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
"Oh beloved dentist:

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
your voice so soft and muffled ...

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Lower the mask, dear dentist,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
lower the mask."

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
(Laughter)

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Okay, in this presentation,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
through a fairly serious workout.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
You're going to see a lot of imagery,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
so I need you to kind of split your brains in half

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and let the images flow over one side

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and listen to me on the other.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
So I am one of those people

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
with a transformative personal story.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Six years ago,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
after 20 years in graphic design and typography,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I changed the way I was working

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and the way most graphic designers work

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to pursue a more personal approach to my work,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
with only the humble attempt

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to simply make a living doing something that I loved.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
But something weird happened.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I became bizarrely

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
popular.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
My current work

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
seems to resonate with people

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
in a way that has so taken me by surprise

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
that I still frequently wonder

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
what in the hell is going on.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And I'm slowly coming to understand

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that the appeal of what I do

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
may be connected to why I do it.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
These days, I call myself a graphic artist.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
So where my work as a graphic designer

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
was to follow strategy,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
my work now

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
follows my heart

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and my interests

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
with the guidance of my ego

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Now, this is heresy

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
in the design world.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
The ego is not supposed

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
to be involved in graphic design.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
But I find that for myself,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
without exception,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the more I deal with the work

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
as something of my own,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
as something that is personal,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the more successful it is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
as something that's compelling,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
interesting and sustaining.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
of design thinking.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Where others might look at measurable results,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
like "Does it bring joy?"

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
"Is there a sense of wonder?"

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
This is a scientific diagram, by the way.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I don't have time to explain it,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but it has to do with DNA and RNA.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
The things that interest me when I'm working

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
are visual structure,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
surprise

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and anything that requires figuring things out.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
to systems and patterns.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
This is a piece that I did for

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
They have a magazine that they call G2.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And this is for their puzzle special

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
in 2007.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And puzzling it is.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I started by creating a series of tiling units.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And these tiling units, I designed

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
specifically so that they would contain

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
parts of letterforms within their shapes

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
so that I could then

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
join those pieces together

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
to create letters and then words

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
within the abstract patterning.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But then as well, I was able to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
just flip them, rotate them

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and combine them in different ways

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to create either regular patterns

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
or abstract patterns.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So here's the word puzzle again.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
But all I have to do is

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
fill certain areas of those letterforms

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and I can bring those words out of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
the background pattern.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
But maybe that's a little too obvious.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So then I can add some color in with the background

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and this way, working with the art director,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
I'm able to bring it to just the right point

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that it's puzzling for the audience --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
they can figure out that there's something they have to read --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
but it's not impossible for them to read.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
I'm also interested in working with

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
unusual materials

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and common materials in unusual ways.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So this requires figuring out how to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
get the most out of something's innate properties

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and also how to bend it to my will.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So ultimately,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
my goal is to create something unexpected.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
To this end, I have worked in sugar

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
for Stefan Sagmeister,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
three-time TED speaker.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And this project began essentially

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
on my kitchen table.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I've been eating cereal for breakfast

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
all of my life.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And for that same amount of time,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
I've been spilling sugar on the table

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And eventually I used this technique

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to create a piece of artwork.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And then I used it again to create

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
six pieces for Stefan's book,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And these were created

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
without sketches, just freehand,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
by putting the sugar down on a white surface

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and then manipulating it to get

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
the words and designs out of it.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Recently, I've also made some

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
rather highbrow baroque borders

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
out of lowbrow pasta.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
and the chapter is on honor.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
So it's a little bit unexpected,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
but, in a way, it refers

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
to the macaroni art

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
that children make for their parents

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
or they make in school and give to their parents,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
which is in itself a form of honor.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.260
(Laughter)

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
I'm very interested in wonder,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
in design as an impetus to inquiring.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
To say I wonder is to say

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
I question, I ask.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And to experience wonder is to experience awe.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
So I'm currently working on a book,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
which plays with both senses of the word,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
as I explore some of my own ideas

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and inquiries

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
in a visual display of rather

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
peacock-like grandeur.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
The world is full of wonder.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
But the world of graphic design,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
for the most part, is not.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
So I'm using my own writings

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
as a kind of testing ground for a book that has

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
an interdependency between word and image

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
as a kind of seductive force.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
I think that one of the things

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
that religions got right

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
was the use of visual wonder

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
to deliver a message.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
I think this true marriage of art and information

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is woefully underused in adult literature,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and I'm mystified as to

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
why visual wealth is not more commonly used

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to enhance intellectual wealth.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
When we look at works like this,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
we tend to associate them with children's literature.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
There's an implication that ornamental graphics

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
detract from the seriousness of the content.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
But I really hope to have the opportunity

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
to change that perception.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
This book is taking rather a long time,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
but I'm nearly done.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to put an intermission

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
in my talk.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
(Laughter)

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So I do these valentines.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
I've been sending out valentines

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
on a fairly large scale since 2005.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
These are my valentines

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
from 2005 and 2006.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And I started by

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
doing just a single image like this

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and sending them out to each person.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
But in 2007,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
I got the cockamamie idea

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
to hand-draw each valentine

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
for everyone on my mailing list.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And I drew each person

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
their own unique valentine

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and put their name on it

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Believe it or not, I devised this

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
as a timesaving method.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
I was very busy in the beginning of that year,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and I didn't know when I was going to find time

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
to design and print a single valentine.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
as I was traveling.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
It didn't exactly work out that way.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
There's a longer story to this,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
but I did get them all done in time,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
and they were extremely well received.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
(Laughter)

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And those who didn't respond

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
will never receive anything from me ever again.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
(Laughter)

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Last year,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
I had this idea that I wanted people

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to receive a kind of

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
mysterious love letter,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
like a found fragment in their mailbox.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
I wanted it to be something

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
that was not addressed to them

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
or signed by me,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
something that caused them to wonder

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
what on Earth this thing was.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And I specifically wrote

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
four pages that don't connect.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
There were four different versions of this.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And I wrote them

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
end in the middle of a sentence.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And they're on the one hand, universal,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
so I avoid specific names or places,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
but on the other hand, they're personal.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
So I wanted people to really get the sense that

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
they had received something that could have been

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
a love letter to them.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
"You've never really been sure of this,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but I can assure you that this quirk

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
you're so self-conscious of

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
is intensely endearing.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Just please accept that this piece of you

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
escapes with your smile,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and those of us who notice

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
are happy to catch it in passing.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
but without the scratches and bird shit."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
(Laughter)

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
"That is to say,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
your thoughts and words flit and dart,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
disconcertedly elusive at times,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
but when caught and examined --

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
ahh, such a wonder,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
such a delightful reward.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
There's no passing time with you,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
only collecting --

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and at the same time release.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
Impossible? I don't think so.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
I know this makes you embarrassed.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I'm certain I can see you blushing.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
But I just have to tell you because

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
sometimes I hear your self-doubt,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and it's so crushing to think

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
how inspiring and delightful

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and really, truly the most completely ..."

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
(Laughter)

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.260
(Applause)

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So Valentine's Day

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
is coming up in a couple of days,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and these are currently arriving

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in mailboxes all around the world.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
This year, I got, what I really have to say

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
is a rather brilliant idea,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
to laser cut

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
my valentines

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
out of used Christmas cards.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So I solicited friends

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
to send me their used Christmas cards,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and I made 500 of these.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Each one of them is completely different.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
I'm just really, really thrilled with them.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
I don't have that much else to say,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
but they turned out really well.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
I do spend a lot of time on my work.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
is what is worth while.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
What is it that's worth spending my time on

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and my life on in this way?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Working in the commercial world,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
What makes something worthwhile for me

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
is the people I work for or with,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
the conditions I work under

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
and the audience that I'm able to reach.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
So I might ask: "Who is it for?"

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
"What does it say?"

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and "What does it do?"

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
for someone like me to come up on stage

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
at this conference

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
with these unbelievably brilliant minds,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
who are thinking these

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
really big-picture,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
world-changing, life-changing

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
ideas and technologies.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And it's very, very common

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
for designers and people in the visual arts

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
to feel that we're

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
not contributing enough,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
or worse, that all we're doing is

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
contributing to landfill.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Here I am; I'm showing you

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
some pretty visuals

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and talking about aesthetics.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
But I've come to believe that

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
truly imaginative visual work

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
is extremely important in society.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Just in the way that I'm inspired

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
by books

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and magazines of all kinds,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
conversations I have, movies,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
so I also think,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
when I put visual work out there into the mass media,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
work that is interesting, unusual,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
intriguing,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
work that maybe opens up that sense

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
of inquiry in the mind,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And you just never know who

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
is going to take something from that

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and turn it into something else,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
because inspiration

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
is cross-pollinating.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
So a piece of mine

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
may inspire a playwright

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
or a novelist or a scientist,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
and that in turn may be the seed

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
that inspires a doctor

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
or a philanthropist

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
or a babysitter.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And this isn't something that you can quantify

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
or track or measure,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
and we tend to undervalue things in society

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
that we can't measure.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
But I really believe

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that a fully operating, rich society

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
needs these seeds coming from all directions

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and all disciplines

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
in order to keep the gears of inspiration

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
and imagination

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
flowing and cycling and growing.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
So that's why I do what I do,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and why I spend so much time and effort on it,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
as opposed to the isolated, private sphere

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
of fine art:

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
because I want as many people as possible

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and be able to take something from it.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
to spend my valuable

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and limited time on this Earth

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
in this way.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:21.260
(Applause)
