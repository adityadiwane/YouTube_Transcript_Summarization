00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:14.085
I think we're all aware

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.058
that the world today is full of problems.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.153
We've been hearing them

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:23.443
today and yesterday and every day for decades.

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:27.487
Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:30.843
Poor nutrition, access to water,

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:33.880
climate change, deforestation,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.124
lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:40.100
not enough healthcare, pollution.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.845
There's problem after problem,

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:44.376
and I think what really separates this time

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:48.500
from any time I can remember in my brief time

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.935
on Earth is the awareness of these problems.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.501
We're all very aware.

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.529
Why are we having so much trouble

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:57.360
dealing with these problems?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.400
That's the question I've been struggling with,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.569
coming from my very different perspective.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.652
I'm not a social problem guy.

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:10.414
I'm a guy that works with business,

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:13.704
helps business make money.

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.938
God forbid.

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:19.992
So why are we having so many problems

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:23.135
with these social problems,

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:25.192
and really is there any role for business,

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:28.725
and if so, what is that role?

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:31.584
I think that in order to address that question,

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:35.450
we have to step back and think about

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.105
how we've understood and pondered

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:41.103
both the problems and the solutions

00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:45.267
to these great social challenges that we face.

00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:48.101
Now, I think many have seen business

00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.976
as the problem, or at least one of the problems,

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.728
in many of the social challenges we face.

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:55.134
You know, think of the fast food industry,

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:57.109
the drug industry, the banking industry.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.288
You know, this is a low point

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:02.279
in the respect for business.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:03.989
Business is not seen as the solution.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.730
It's seen as the problem now, for most people.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.704
And rightly so, in many cases.

00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:11.983
There's a lot of bad actors out there

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.160
that have done the wrong thing,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.961
that actually have made the problem worse.

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.424
So this perspective is perhaps justified.

00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:22.014
How have we tended to see the solutions

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:24.350
to these social problems,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.512
these many issues that we face in society?

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.144
Well, we've tended to see the solutions

00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:31.296
in terms of NGOs,

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.302
in terms of government,

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.439
in terms of philanthropy.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.873
Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity

00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:42.630
of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.136
and social organizations.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:47.960
This is a unique, new organizational form

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.153
that we've seen grown up.

00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:52.560
Enormous innovation, enormous energy,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.295
enormous talent now has been mobilized

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.415
through this structure

00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:02.268
to try to deal with all of these challenges.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:06.525
And many of us here are deeply involved in that.

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:08.034
I'm a business school professor,

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:12.049
but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.938
Whenever I got interested and became aware

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:17.998
of a societal problem, that was what I did,

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.876
form a nonprofit.

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.939
That was the way we've thought about how to deal

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:23.948
with these issues.

00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:28.400
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.235
But I think at this moment,

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:33.004
we've been at this for quite a while.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.856
We've been aware of these problems for decades.

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:37.766
We have decades of experience

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:42.091
with our NGOs and with our government entities,

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.920
and there's an awkward reality.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.862
The awkward reality is we're not making

00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:48.446
fast enough progress.

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:51.170
We're not winning.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.254
These problems still seem very daunting

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:54.460
and very intractable,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.160
and any solutions we're achieving

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.100
are small solutions.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.982
We're making incremental progress.

00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:05.704
What's the fundamental problem we have

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.782
in dealing with these social problems?

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:12.814
If we cut all the complexity away,

00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:16.193
we have the problem of scale.

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.304
We can't scale.

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:22.231
We can make progress. We can show benefits.

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:25.559
We can show results. We can make things better.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.837
We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:32.191
We can't scale.

00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:37.157
We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.

00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:38.991
Why is that?

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:42.581
Because we don't have the resources.

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.292
And that's really clear now.

00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:47.174
And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:50.726
There's simply not enough money

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:54.117
to deal with any of these problems at scale

00:04:54.117 --> 00:04:56.442
using the current model.

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:59.512
There's not enough tax revenue,

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:03.558
there's not enough philanthropic donations,

00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:06.006
to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:11.171
We've got to confront that reality.

00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.230
And the scarcity of resources

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.257
for dealing with these problems is only growing,

00:05:18.257 --> 00:05:21.807
certainly in the advanced world today,

00:05:21.807 --> 00:05:26.186
with all the fiscal problems we face.

00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:30.431
So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:34.476
where are the resources in society?

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:36.861
How are those resources really created,

00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:38.568
the resources we're going to need to deal

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.208
with all these societal challenges?

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.324
Well there, I think the answer is very clear:

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:49.010
They're in business.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.621
All wealth is actually created by business.

00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:57.347
Business creates wealth

00:05:57.347 --> 00:06:02.393
when it meets needs at a profit.

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:04.857
That's how all wealth is created.

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:07.230
It's meeting needs at a profit

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.642
that leads to taxes

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.311
and that leads to incomes

00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:13.578
and that leads to charitable donations.

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:16.829
That's where all the resources come from.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:19.287
Only business can actually create resources.

00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:21.241
Other institutions can utilize them

00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:22.466
to do important work,

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:25.650
but only business can create them.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.171
And business creates them

00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:35.049
when it's able to meet a need at a profit.

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:38.433
The resources are overwhelmingly

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:40.322
generated by business.

00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:45.625
The question then is, how do we tap into this?

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:48.000
How do we tap into this?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.947
Business generates those resources

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:55.616
when it makes a profit.

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.990
That profit is that small difference

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.836
between the price and the cost it takes to produce

00:07:03.836 --> 00:07:06.153
whatever solution business has created

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:09.376
to whatever problem they're trying to solve.

00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:16.136
But that profit is the magic.

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.890
Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.109
we've created

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.299
to be infinitely scalable.

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:29.900
Because if we can make a profit,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.424
we can do it for 10, 100, a million,

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:36.716
100 million, a billion.

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:41.436
The solution becomes self-sustaining.

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:44.035
That's what business does

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:47.645
when it makes a profit.

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.029
Now what does this all have to do

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:53.097
with social problems?

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:56.379
Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:01.928
and redeploy it into social problems.

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:03.194
Business should give more.

00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:04.618
Business should be more responsible.

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.068
And that's been the path that we've been on

00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:09.754
in business.

00:08:09.754 --> 00:08:11.618
But again, this path that we've been on

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:15.958
is not getting us where we need to go.

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.106
Now, I started out as a strategy professor,

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:20.612
and I'm still a strategy professor.

00:08:20.612 --> 00:08:21.971
I'm proud of that.

00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:23.497
But I've also, over the years,

00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:26.153
worked more and more on social issues.

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:29.420
I've worked on healthcare, the environment,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.992
economic development, reducing poverty,

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:37.337
and as I worked more and more in the social field,

00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:38.899
I started seeing something

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:42.169
that had a profound impact on me

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.755
and my whole life, in a way.

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:49.544
The conventional wisdom in economics

00:08:49.544 --> 00:08:53.412
and the view in business has historically been

00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:57.369
that actually, there's a tradeoff

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:02.377
between social performance and economic performance.

00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:03.861
The conventional wisdom has been

00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:06.931
that business actually makes a profit

00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:08.724
by causing a social problem.

00:09:08.724 --> 00:09:10.906
The classic example is pollution.

00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:13.682
If business pollutes, it makes more money

00:09:13.682 --> 00:09:18.323
than if it tried to reduce that pollution.

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.214
Reducing pollution is expensive,

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:25.697
therefore businesses don't want to do it.

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:28.642
It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.

00:09:28.642 --> 00:09:31.380
It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.686
therefore business makes more money

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:34.526
if they don't have a safe working environment.

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:38.023
That's been the conventional wisdom.

00:09:38.023 --> 00:09:40.836
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.

00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:43.379
They resisted environmental improvement.

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:48.813
They resisted workplace improvement.

00:09:48.813 --> 00:09:52.359
That thinking has led to, I think,

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.879
much of the behavior

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.815
that we have come to criticize in business,

00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:58.335
that I come to criticize in business.

00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:01.868
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.880
one after another,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.326
and actually, the more I tried to address them

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:09.442
myself, personally, in a few cases,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.171
through nonprofits that I was involved with,

00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:15.109
the more I found actually that the reality

00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:17.643
is the opposite.

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:18.889
Business does not profit

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:20.591
from causing social problems,

00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:24.965
actually not in any fundamental sense.

00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:27.158
That's a very simplistic view.

00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:29.866
The deeper we get into these issues,

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:31.711
the more we start to understand

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:33.612
that actually business profits

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:35.608
from solving from social problems.

00:10:35.608 --> 00:10:38.152
That's where the real profit comes.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:40.993
Let's take pollution.

00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:43.209
We've learned today that actually

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.616
reducing pollution and emissions

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:49.122
is generating profit.

00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:51.190
It saves money.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.888
It makes the business more productive and efficient.

00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:54.285
It doesn't waste resources.

00:10:54.285 --> 00:10:56.928
Having a safer working environment actually,

00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:58.416
and avoiding accidents,

00:10:58.416 --> 00:10:59.788
it makes the business more profitable,

00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:02.996
because it's a sign of good processes.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:07.027
Accidents are expensive and costly.

00:11:07.027 --> 00:11:09.631
Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn

00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:12.597
that actually there's no trade-off

00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:16.193
between social progress

00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:19.194
and economic efficiency

00:11:19.194 --> 00:11:21.287
in any fundamental sense.

00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:22.646
Another issue is health.

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:25.215
I mean, what we've found is actually

00:11:25.215 --> 00:11:27.097
health of employees is something

00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:28.490
that business should treasure,

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.818
because that health allows those employees

00:11:30.818 --> 00:11:32.227
to be more productive and come to work

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:34.543
and not be absent.

00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:37.967
The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:42.151
on the interface between business and social problems

00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:45.069
is actually showing that there's a fundamental,

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:46.988
deep synergy,

00:11:46.988 --> 00:11:50.916
particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.754
In the very short run, you can sometimes

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.855
fool yourself into thinking

00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:57.150
that there's fundamentally opposing goals,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.963
but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning

00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:04.159
in field after field that this is simply not true.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:07.449
So how could we tap into

00:12:07.449 --> 00:12:10.171
the power of business

00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:12.374
to address the fundamental problems

00:12:12.374 --> 00:12:14.807
that we face?

00:12:14.807 --> 00:12:17.407
Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:19.447
we could scale.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.856
We could tap into this enormous resource pool

00:12:21.856 --> 00:12:24.754
and this organizational capacity.

00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:30.244
And guess what? That's happening now, finally,

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:34.257
partly because of people like you

00:12:34.257 --> 00:12:36.205
who have raised these issues now

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:39.320
for year after year and decade after decade.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.728
We see organizations like Dow Chemical

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:43.646
leading the revolution away from trans fat

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:46.778
and saturated fat with innovative new products.

00:12:46.778 --> 00:12:48.731
This is an example of Jain Irrigation.

00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:51.282
This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology

00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:53.951
to thousands and millions of farmers,

00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:57.002
reducing substantially the use of water.

00:12:57.002 --> 00:13:00.323
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria

00:13:00.323 --> 00:13:01.806
that's figured out how to avoid

00:13:01.806 --> 00:13:03.685
tearing down old growth forest

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:06.461
and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield

00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.451
per hectare of pulp

00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:10.419
and making much more paper than you could make

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:12.528
by cutting down those old trees.

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.408
You see companies like Cisco that are training

00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:19.564
so far four million people in I.T. skills

00:13:19.564 --> 00:13:21.507
to actually, yes, be responsible,

00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:23.938
but help expand the opportunity

00:13:23.938 --> 00:13:26.211
to disseminate I.T. technology

00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:27.513
and grow the whole business.

00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:32.134
There's a fundamental opportunity for business today

00:13:32.134 --> 00:13:36.190
to impact and address these social problems,

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.514
and this opportunity

00:13:37.514 --> 00:13:40.782
is the largest business opportunity

00:13:40.782 --> 00:13:44.448
we see in business.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.654
And the question is, how can we get business

00:13:46.654 --> 00:13:50.082
thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?

00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:51.891
This is what I call shared value:

00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:55.646
addressing a social issue with a business model.

00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:57.570
That's shared value.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.399
Shared value is capitalism,

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:01.961
but it's a higher kind of capitalism.

00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:05.321
It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,

00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.734
meeting important needs,

00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:11.557
not incrementally competing for

00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:14.820
trivial differences in product attributes

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.553
and market share.

00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:18.772
Shared value is when we can create social value

00:14:18.772 --> 00:14:21.375
and economic value simultaneously.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:23.885
It's finding those opportunities

00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:26.950
that will unleash the greatest possibility we have

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.941
to actually address these social problems

00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:30.974
because we can scale.

00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:34.530
We can address shared value at multiple levels.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.695
It's real. It's happening.

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:40.588
But in order to get this solution working,

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:44.716
we have to now change how business sees itself,

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:47.230
and this is thankfully underway.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.706
Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:52.554
that they shouldn't worry about social problems,

00:14:52.554 --> 00:14:54.596
that this was sort of something on the side,

00:14:54.596 --> 00:14:57.177
that somebody else was doing it.

00:14:57.177 --> 00:14:58.753
We're now seeing companies

00:14:58.753 --> 00:15:01.229
embrace this idea.

00:15:01.229 --> 00:15:03.418
But we also have to recognize business

00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:06.162
is not going to do this as effectively

00:15:06.162 --> 00:15:08.022
as if we have NGOs and government

00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:11.053
working in partnership with business.

00:15:11.053 --> 00:15:14.061
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle

00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:16.244
are the ones that have found these partnerships,

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:18.061
that have found these ways to collaborate.

00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:20.534
The governments that are making the most progress

00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:22.148
are the governments that have found ways

00:15:22.148 --> 00:15:25.799
to enable shared value in business

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:28.920
rather than see government as the only player

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.934
that has to call the shots.

00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:34.406
And government has many ways in which it could impact

00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:36.720
the willingness and the ability of companies

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.714
to compete in this way.

00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:41.663
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,

00:15:41.663 --> 00:15:44.206
and if we can get others seeing business differently,

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:47.011
we can change the world.

00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:50.216
I know it. I'm seeing it.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.166
I'm feeling it.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.861
Young people, I think,

00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:57.041
my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:16:01.363
If we can break down this sort of divide,

00:16:01.363 --> 00:16:04.373
this unease, this tension,

00:16:04.373 --> 00:16:06.303
this sense that we're not

00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:08.543
fundamentally collaborating here

00:16:08.543 --> 00:16:10.893
in driving these social problems,

00:16:10.893 --> 00:16:12.997
we can break this down,

00:16:12.997 --> 00:16:14.997
and we finally, I think,

00:16:14.997 --> 00:16:17.629
can have solutions.

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:20.429
Thank you.

00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:23.151
(Applause)
