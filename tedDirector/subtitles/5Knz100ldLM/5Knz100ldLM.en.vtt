00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:19.363
How often do we hear
that people just don't care?

00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.809
How many times have you been told

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:25.074
that real, substantial change
isn't possible

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:27.173
because most people are too selfish,

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:29.129
too stupid or too lazy

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:31.785
to try to make a difference
in their community?

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.903
I propose to you today
that apathy as we think we know it

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.638
doesn't actually exist;

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:38.836
but rather, that people do care,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.569
but that we live in a world
that actively discourages engagement

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:45.954
by constantly putting obstacles
and barriers in our way.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.010
I'll give you some
examples of what I mean.

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.747
Let's start with city hall.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:51.836
You ever see one of these before?

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.836
This is a newspaper ad.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.228
It's a notice of a zoning application
change for a new office building

00:00:57.252 --> 00:00:59.323
so the neighborhood
knows what's happening.

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.269
As you can see, it's impossible to read.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.669
You need to get halfway down

00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:05.227
to even find out which address
they're talking about,

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.395
and then further down,
in tiny 10-point font,

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.455
to find out how to actually get involved.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.606
Imagine if the private sector
advertised in the same way --

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.672
if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes --

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:15.836
(Laughter)

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.825
And put an ad in the paper like that.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.836
(Applause)

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.836
Now, that would never happen.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.274
You'll never see an ad like that,

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.729
because Nike actually wants
you to buy their shoes,

00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:31.634
whereas the city of Toronto
clearly doesn't want you involved

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.910
with the planning process,

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.350
otherwise their ads would look
something like this,

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:37.391
with all the information laid out clearly.

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.832
As long as the city's putting out
notices like this

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:41.282
to try to get people engaged,

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:43.640
then of course people
aren't going to be engaged.

00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:46.252
But that's not apathy;
that's intentional exclusion.

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:48.848
Public space.

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:51.660
(Applause)

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.116
The manner in which we mistreat
our public spaces

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.400
is a huge obstacle towards any type
of progressive political change,

00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:01.623
because we've essentially put a price tag
on freedom of expression.

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:04.232
Whoever has the most money
gets the loudest voice,

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.655
dominating the visual
and mental environment.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.659
The problem with this model
is there are some amazing messages

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.524
that need to be said,
that aren't profitable to say.

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:15.050
So you're never going
to see them on a billboard.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:17.628
The media plays an important role

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:20.836
in developing our relationship
with political change,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.011
mainly by ignoring politics and focusing
on celebrities and scandals,

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.888
but even when they do talk
about important political issues,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:30.765
they do it in a way that I feel
discourages engagement.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.007
I'll give you an example.

00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.624
The "Now" magazine from last week:
progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:36.836
This is the cover story.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.348
It's an article
about a theater performance,

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.130
and it starts with basic
information about where it is,

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:45.679
in case you actually want to go and see
it after you've read the article --

00:02:45.703 --> 00:02:47.486
where, the time, the website.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.915
Same with this -- it's a movie review.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.523
An art review.

00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:54.685
A book review -- where the reading
is in case you want to go.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.419
A restaurant -- you might not
want to just read about it,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.870
maybe you want to go there.

00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:02.667
So they tell you where it is, the prices,
the address, the phone number, etc.

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:04.668
Then you get to their political articles.

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:08.152
Here's a great article about an important
election race that's happening.

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:10.505
It talks about the candidates,
written very well,

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.756
but no information, no follow-up,
no websites for the campaigns,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.305
no information about when the debates
are, where the campaign offices are.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.758
Here's another good article,

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.836
about a new campaign
opposing privatization of transit,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.574
without any contact information
for the campaign.

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:26.122
The message seems to be

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:29.557
that the readers are most likely
to want to eat, maybe read a book,

00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:32.344
maybe see a movie, but not be engaged
in their community.

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:35.506
You might think this is a small thing,
but I think it's important,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.926
because it sets a tone

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.579
and it reinforces the dangerous idea
that politics is a spectator sport.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.668
Heroes: How do we view leadership?

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.355
Look at these 10 movies.
What do they have in common?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.544
Anyone?

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.372
They all have heroes who were chosen.

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:56.111
Someone came up to them and said,
"You're the chosen one.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.409
There's a prophecy.
You have to save the world."

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:01.735
And then they go off and save the world
because they've been told to,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.318
with a few people tagging along.

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:04.498
This helps me understand

00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:07.549
why a lot of people have trouble
seeing themselves as leaders --

00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:11.097
because it sends all the wrong messages
about what leadership is about.

00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:13.634
A heroic effort is a collective effort,

00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:14.836
number one.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:18.556
Number two, it's imperfect;
it's not very glamorous,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.762
and doesn't suddenly start
and suddenly end.

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:22.848
It's an ongoing process your whole life.

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:24.649
But most importantly, it's voluntary.

00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:26.091
It's voluntary.

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.478
As long as we're teaching our kids

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.924
that heroism starts when someone
scratches a mark on your forehead,

00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:34.174
or someone tells you
you're part of a prophecy,

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:37.227
they're missing the most important
characteristic of leadership,

00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:38.938
which is that it comes from within.

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:42.836
It's about following
your own dreams, uninvited,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.836
and then working with others
to make those dreams come true.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.836
Political parties: oh, boy.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.752
Political parties could and should be
one of the basic entry points

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:54.703
for people to get engaged in politics.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.992
Instead, they've become, sadly,

00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:59.902
uninspiring and uncreative organizations

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:03.836
that rely so heavily on market research
and polling and focus groups

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.908
that they end up all saying
the same thing,

00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:09.028
pretty much regurgitating back
to us what we already want to hear

00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:11.836
at the expense of putting forward
bold and creative ideas.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.616
And people can smell that,
and it feeds cynicism.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.616
(Applause)

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:22.428
Charitable status.

00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:26.206
Groups who have charitable status
in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.761
This is a huge problem
and a huge obstacle to change,

00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:32.257
because it means that some
of the most passionate and informed voices

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.164
are completely silenced,
especially during election time.

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:38.551
Which leads us to the last one,
which is: our elections.

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:40.124
As you may have noticed,

00:05:40.148 --> 00:05:42.255
our elections in Canada
are a complete joke.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.770
We use out-of-date systems

00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:46.095
that are unfair and create random results.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.836
Canada's currently led by a party

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.308
that most Canadians didn't actually want.

00:05:50.332 --> 00:05:53.947
How can we honestly and genuinely
encourage more people to vote

00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:56.248
when votes don't count in Canada?

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.640
You add all this up together,
and of course people are apathetic.

00:05:59.664 --> 00:06:01.724
It's like trying to run into a brick wall.

00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:05.065
Now, I'm not trying to be negative
by throwing all these obstacles out

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.689
and explaining what's in our way.

00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:07.866
Quite the opposite --

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.374
I actually think people are amazing
and smart and that they do care,

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:14.836
but that, as I said,
we live in this environment

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.998
where all these obstacles
are being put in our way.

00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:22.199
As long as we believe
that people, our own neighbors,

00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:24.919
are selfish, stupid or lazy,

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.969
then there's no hope.

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:30.375
But we can change
all those things I mentioned.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.836
We can open up city hall.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.592
We can reform our electoral systems.

00:06:33.616 --> 00:06:35.593
We can democratize our public spaces.

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:37.389
My main message is:

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:39.091
if we can redefine apathy,

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.137
not as some kind of internal syndrome,

00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:45.955
but as a complex web of cultural barriers
that reinforces disengagement,

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:52.152
and if we can clearly define,
clearly identify what those obstacles are,

00:06:52.176 --> 00:06:55.767
and then if we can work together
collectively to dismantle those obstacles,

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.045
then anything is possible.

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.229
Thank you.

00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:00.253
(Applause)
