00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.507
One of my favorite words in the whole
of the Oxford English Dictionary

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.374
is "snollygoster,"

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.044
just because it sounds so good.

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:26.457
And what snollygoster means
is "a dishonest politician."

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:29.906
Although there was a 19th-century
newspaper editor

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.963
who defined it rather better when he said,

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:34.503
"A snollygoster is a fellow
who seeks office

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.110
regardless of party,
platform or principle,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:39.642
and who, when he wins,

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:44.890
gets there by the sheer force
of monumental talknophical assumnancy."

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.443
(Laughter)

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.565
Now, I have no idea
what "talknophical" is.

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.391
Something to do with words, I assume.

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:53.690
But it's very important that words
are at the center of politics,

00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:56.919
and all politicians know
they have to try and control language.

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:59.971
It wasn't until, for example, 1771

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:04.418
that the British Parliament
allowed newspapers to report

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.214
the exact words that were said
in the debating chamber.

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:10.011
And this was actually
all down to the bravery

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.344
of a guy with the extraordinary
name of Brass Crosby,

00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:15.094
who took on Parliament.

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:17.196
And he was thrown into the Tower of London

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.314
and imprisoned,

00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:22.147
but he was brave enough,

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.650
he was brave enough
to take them on, and in the end,

00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:27.109
he had such popular support
in London that he won.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.896
And it was only a few years later

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.791
that we have the first recorded use
of the phrase "as bold as brass."

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.345
Most people think
that's down to the metal.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.199
It's not; it's down to a campaigner
for the freedom of the press.

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:44.997
But to really show you
how words and politics interact,

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.641
I want to take you back
to the United States of America,

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:50.029
just after they'd achieved independence.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.217
And they had to face the question

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.946
of what to call
George Washington, their leader.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.226
They didn't know.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.206
What do you call the leader
of a republican country?

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:02.462
And this was debated
in Congress for ages and ages.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:05.018
And there were all sorts
of suggestions on the table,

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.237
which might have made it.

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:08.498
I mean, some people
wanted him to be called

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:10.312
"Chief Magistrate Washington,"

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:12.825
and other people,
"His Highness, George Washington,"

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.083
and other people,

00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:16.865
"Protector of the Liberties

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.940
of the People of the United States
of America Washington."

00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:21.300
Not that catchy.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:24.041
Some people just wanted
to call him king --

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.571
it was tried and tested.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:27.325
They weren't even being monarchical,

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.563
they had the idea that you could
be elected king for a fixed term.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.851
And, you know, it could have worked.

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:34.733
And everybody got insanely bored,

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:36.831
because this debate
went on for three weeks.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:39.845
I read a diary of this poor senator
who just keeps coming back,

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.117
"Still on this subject."

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.670
And the reason for the delay
and the boredom

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:47.309
was that the House of Representatives
were against the Senate.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.550
The House of Representatives didn't want
Washington to get drunk on power.

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:54.661
They didn't want to call him "king,"
in case that gave him ideas,

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.025
or his successor ideas.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.196
So they wanted to give him
the humblest, meagerest,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.867
most pathetic title
that they could think of.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.846
And that title ...

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:06.099
was "President."

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:08.187
(Laughter)

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:10.238
"President." They didn't invent the title.

00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:11.584
I mean, it existed before,

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.273
but it just meant somebody
who presides over a meeting.

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:16.180
It was like the foreman of the jury.

00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:18.040
And it didn't have much more grandeur

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.918
than the term "foreman" or "overseer."

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:22.815
There were occasional presidents
of little colonial councils

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.011
and bits of government,

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.800
but it was really a nothing title.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.260
And that's why the Senate objected to it.

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:32.033
They said, "That's ridiculous!
You can't call him 'President.'

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:35.476
This guy has to go and sign treaties
and meet foreign dignitaries.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.055
Who's going to take him seriously
if he's got a silly little title

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.720
like 'President of the United
States of America'?"

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:42.755
(Laughter)

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.211
And after three weeks
of debate, in the end,

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:49.245
the Senate did not cave in.

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:55.486
Instead, they agreed to use
the title "President" for now.

00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:59.100
But they also wanted
it absolutely set down

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:00.941
that they didn't agree with it,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.678
from a decent respect for the opinions
and practice of civilized nations,

00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:11.506
whether under republican
or monarchical forms of government,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.644
whose custom it is to annex,

00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:15.684
through the office
of the Chief Magistrate,

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:17.839
titles of respectability --

00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:19.759
not bloody "President."

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:23.364
And that, in the intercourse
with foreign nations,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.517
the majesty of the people
of the United States

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:31.524
may not be hazarded
by an appearance of singularity --

00:04:31.548 --> 00:04:33.960
i.e., we don't want to look
like bloody weirdos.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.350
Now, you can learn
three interesting things from this.

00:04:38.374 --> 00:04:40.571
First of all -- and this is my favorite --

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:43.031
is that, so far as I've ever
been able to find out,

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:47.359
the Senate has never formally
endorsed the title of President.

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:51.270
Barack Obama, President Obama,
is there on borrowed time,

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:54.434
just waiting for the Senate
to spring into action.

00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:55.704
(Laughter)

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.180
The second thing you can learn

00:04:57.204 --> 00:05:00.424
is that, when a government says
that this is a temporary measure --

00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:02.816
(Laughter)

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.211
you can still be waiting 223 years later.

00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:11.630
But the third thing you can learn --
and this is the really important one,

00:05:11.654 --> 00:05:13.378
the point I want to leave you on --

00:05:13.402 --> 00:05:17.334
is that the title, "President
of the United States of America,"

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:20.663
doesn't sound that humble
at all these days, does it?

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:24.703
Something to do
with the slightly over 5,000

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:26.977
nuclear warheads he has at his disposal

00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.174
and the largest economy in the world

00:05:29.198 --> 00:05:31.717
and a fleet of drones
and all that sort of stuff.

00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:38.766
Reality and history
have endowed that title with grandeur.

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.369
And so the Senate won in the end.

00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:43.821
They got their title of respectability.

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:47.381
And also, the Senate's other worry,
the appearance of singularity --

00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:49.529
well, it was a singularity back then.

00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:52.402
But now, do you know
how many nations have a president?

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.209
A hundred and forty-seven.

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:56.783
All because they want
to sound like the guy

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.359
who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:04.294
And so, in the end, the Senate won

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:06.775
and the House of Representatives lost ...

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:10.339
because nobody's going to feel that humble

00:06:10.363 --> 00:06:12.050
when they're told that they are now

00:06:12.074 --> 00:06:15.106
the President of the United
States of America.

00:06:16.503 --> 00:06:19.269
And that's the important lesson
I think you can take away,

00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:21.068
and the one I want to leave you with.

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:24.886
Politicians try to pick and use words
to shape and control reality,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.568
but in fact,

00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:31.772
reality changes words far more
than words can ever change reality.

00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:33.767
Thank you very much.
