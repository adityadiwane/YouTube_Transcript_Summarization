00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.276
I want to introduce you to some
very wise kids that I've known,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.740
but first I want
to introduce you to a camel.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.796
This is Cassie, a therapy camel
visiting one of our young patients

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.020
in her room,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.100
which is pretty magical.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.380
A friend of mine raises camels
at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.516
He has about eight of them,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.236
and he started 30 years ago

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.380
because he thought
horses were too mundane.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.596
John is an out-of-the-box thinker,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.436
which explains why the two of us
have been such good friends

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.660
all of our lives.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.156
Over the years, I've convinced him
to shuttle those sweet furry beasts

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.140
up to hang out with our sick kids
from time to time.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.676
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.900
that camels have an average
life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.916
The life expectancy of many
of the children with whom I work

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.260
is less than a year.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.395
This is a picture
of the George Mark Children's House,

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:19.916
the first pediatric
palliative respite care center

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.196
to open in the United States.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.196
I founded it in 2004,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.156
after years of working as a psychologist

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.876
on pediatric intensive care units,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.916
frustrated with the undignified deaths
that so many children experienced

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.860
and their families had to endure.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.956
As I sat with families whose children
were at the end of their lives,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.636
I was acutely aware of our surroundings.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.676
While the elevated train
rumbled overhead on its track,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.460
quite literally the room reverberated
with each passing train car.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.676
The lights on the ward
were fluorescent and too bright.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.916
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.940
noisily announcing its arrival.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.676
These families were experiencing

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.316
some of the most excruciating
moments of their lives,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.916
and I so wanted them
to have a more peaceful place

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.500
in which to say a last goodbye
to their young daughters and sons.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.940
Surely, I thought,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.396
there must be a better spot
than a hospital intensive care unit

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.620
for children at the end of their lives.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.140
Our children's house

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340
is calm and nurturing.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.476
It's a place where families
can stay together

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.076
to enjoy quality time with their children,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.836
many of whom are there for respite stays,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.396
some with repeated visits
over a span of many years.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.980
We call those kids our frequent flyers.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.596
Rather than the bright,
noisy quarters of the hospital,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.436
their rooms are calm and comfortable,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.716
with actual living spaces
for the families,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.516
a sanctuary of gardens

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.036
and a wonderful outdoor playground

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.580
with special structures
for children with physical limitations.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.196
This sweet baby Lars

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.180
came to us directly
from a hospital intensive care unit.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.396
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.580
that none of us would ever want to hear.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.916
His parents had been told
that Lars had a brain anomaly

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.756
that would keep him from ever swallowing,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.676
walking, talking

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.380
or developing mentally.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.276
Recognizing what little chance
he had for survival,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.356
his parents chose
to focus on the quality of time

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.860
that they could spend together.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.996
They moved into
one of our family apartments

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.436
and treasured each day that they had,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.940
which were far too few.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.676
Lars's life was brief, to be sure,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.316
mere weeks,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.876
but it was calm and comfortable.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.100
He went on hikes with his parents.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.716
The time that he spent in the pool
with our aquatic therapist

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.916
lessened the seizures he was experiencing

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.620
and helped him to sleep at night.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.196
His family had a peaceful place

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.596
in which to both celebrate his life

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.060
and mourn his death.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.076
It has been five years
since Lars was with us,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.996
and in that time,

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.356
his family has welcomed

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.540
a daughter and another son.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.036
They are such a powerful testament

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.219
to the positive outcome that specialized
children's hospice care can create.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.116
Their baby's physical discomfort
was well managed,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.900
giving all of them the gift of time
to be together in a beautiful place.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.116
I'm going to talk to you now

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.356
about the elephant

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.140
rather than the camel in the room.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.396
Very few people want to talk about death,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.940
and even fewer about children's death.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.060
Loss of a child,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.476
especially for those of us
who have our own children,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.700
is frightening,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.820
more than frightening,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.860
paralyzing,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.940
debilitating,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.940
impossible.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.396
But what I've learned is this:

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.436
children don't stop dying

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.436
just because we the adults

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.140
can't comprehend
the injustice of losing them.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.100
And what's more,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.116
if we can be brave enough

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.996
to face the possibility of death,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.940
even among the most innocent,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.620
we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.660
Take Crystal, for example.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.756
She was one of the first children
to come for care

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.180
after we opened our doors.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.756
She was nine when she arrived,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.116
and her neurologist expected
that she might live another two weeks.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.636
She had an inoperable brain tumor,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.396
and her decline had really accelerated

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.340
in the week before she came to us.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.036
After settling into her room,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.796
dressed entirely in pink and lavender,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.916
surrounded by the Hello Kitty
accessories that she loved,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.676
she spent the next several days

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.260
winning over the hearts
of every staff member.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.756
Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.196
and then to our astonishment,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.860
she actually improved.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.636
There were a variety of factors

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.236
that contributed to Crystal's improvement

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.820
which we later came to call
the "George Mark bump,"

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.796
a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.716
where children outlive
the prognoses of their illnesses

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.420
if they're outside of the hospital.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.540
The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.156
tasty meals that were fixed
often to accommodate her requests,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.860
the resident pets,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.700
the therapy dog and rabbit
spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.916
After she had been with us
for about a week,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.836
she called her grandmother,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.276
and she said,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.916
"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.180
and there's room for you to come, too.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.556
And guess what?

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.596
You don't have to bring any quarters

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.876
because the washer and dryer are free."

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.076
(Laughter)

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.956
Crystal's grandmother
soon arrived from out of town,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.516
and they spent the remaining
four months of Crystal's life

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.996
enjoying very special days together.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.996
Some days were special because Crystal
was outside in her wheelchair

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.300
sitting by the fountain.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.236
For a little girl who had spent most
of the year earlier in a hospital bed,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.196
being outside counting hummingbirds

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.556
made for an amazing time with her grandma,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.780
and lots of laughter.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.996
Other days were special
because of the activities

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.860
that our child life specialist
created for her.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.836
Crystal strung beads and made jewelry
for everybody in the house.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.020
She painted a pumpkin
to help decorate for Halloween.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.516
She spent many excited days
planning her tenth birthday,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.260
which of course none of us
thought she would ever see.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.956
All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.516
and Crystal, as you can see,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.756
queen for a day,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.300
wore a sparkly tiara.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.196
One hot morning, I arrived at work

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.716
and Crystal and her partner
in crime, Charlie, greeted me.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.876
With some help, they had set up
a lemonade and cookie stand

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.220
outside the front door,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.060
a very strategic location.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.516
I asked Crystal the price
of the cookie that I had selected,

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.076
and she said, "Three dollars."

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.955
(Laughter)

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:50.076
I said that seemed a bit high
for one cookie.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.835
(Laughter)

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:53.060
It was small.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.836
"I know," she acknowledged with a grin,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.260
"but I'm worth it."

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.716
And therein lie the words of wisdom

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.220
of a young girl whose brief life
forever impacted mine.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.060
Crystal was worth it,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.196
and shouldn't every child whose life
is shortened by a horrific illness

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.420
be worth it?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.076
Together, all of us today

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.356
can offer that same specialized care
that Crystal received

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.036
by recognizing that children's
respite and hospice care

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.420
is a critical component missing
from our healthcare landscape.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:36.756
It's also interesting to note

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.596
that we are able to provide this care

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.300
at about one third of the cost
of a hospital intensive care unit,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.980
and our families don't see a bill.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.476
We are ever grateful to the supporters

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.940
who believe in this important work
that we're doing.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.276
The truth is that my colleagues and I

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.876
and the parents and other family members

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.876
who get to experience this special wisdom

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.660
are in a unique position.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.916
There are only two freestanding
pediatric hospices in the United States,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.636
although I'm happy to report
that based on our model,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.716
there are 18 others
under various stages of development.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.900
(Applause)

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.276
Still, most of the children
who die in the United States every year

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.316
die in hospital rooms,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.756
surrounded by beeping machines

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.876
and anxious, exhausted adults

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.876
who have no other option

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.716
but to say goodbye
under those harsh, institutional lights

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.780
and among virtual strangers.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.756
For comparison's sake,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.116
the United Kingdom,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.276
which is a country with about one fifth
the population of the United States,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.916
and about half the size
of the state of California,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.340
has 54 hospice and respite centers.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.516
Why is that?

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.316
I've asked myself that question
obviously many times.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.836
My best guess is that Americans,
with our positive can-do attitude

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.436
hold the expectation
that our medical care system will fix it,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.940
even though it may be a childhood illness
for which there is no cure.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.676
We go to extraordinary measures
to keep children alive

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.076
when in fact the greatest kindness
that we might give them

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.836
would be a peaceful, pain-free

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.060
end of life.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.036
The transition from cure to care

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.276
remains a challenging one
for many hospital physicians

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.796
whose training has really been
about saving lives,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.420
not about gently guiding the patient
to the end of life.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.996
The dad of a sweet baby
for whom we cared at the end of her life

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.556
certainly captured this dichotomy

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.156
when he reflected

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.156
that there are a lot of people
to help you bring an infant into the world

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.580
but very few to help you usher a baby out.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.020
So what is the magic ingredient
at George Mark?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.076
The complex medical diagnoses
that bring our young patients to us

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.076
mean that their lives
have often been restricted,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.836
some to a hospital bed
for long periods of time,

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.716
others to wheelchairs,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.980
still others to intensive courses
of chemotherapy or rehab.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.636
We make a practice
of ignoring those limitations.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.876
Our default answer is "yes"

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.660
and our default question is, "Why not?"

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.116
That's why we took a young boy

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.116
who wasn't going to live
for another baseball season

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.700
to Game 5 of the World Series.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.996
That's why we have a talent show
put on by the staff and kids

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.636
for family and friends.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.716
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy
playing a piano piece with his feet,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.260
because his arms are atrophied?

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.860
That's why we have a prom every year.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.020
It's pretty magical.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.476
We started the prom

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.116
after hearing a dad lament

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.620
that he would never pin
a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.436
The weeks before the dance,

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.716
the house is in a flurry,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.516
and I don't know who's more excited,
the staff or the kids.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.676
(Laughter)

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.316
The night of the event

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.796
involves rides in vintage cars,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.796
a walk on a red carpet

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.316
into the great room,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.140
a terrific DJ

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.756
and a photographer at the ready

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.316
to capture pictures of these attendees

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.700
and their families.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.756
At the end of the evening this year,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.460
one of our young,
delightful teenaged girls,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.820
Caitlin, said to her mom,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.276
"That was the best night
of my whole life."

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.676
And that's just the point,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.436
to capture the best days and nights,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.540
to abolish limitations,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.476
to have your default answer be "yes"

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.540
and your default question be, "Why not?"

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.116
Ultimately life is too short,

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.596
whether we live
to be 85 years or just eight.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.876
Trust me.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.740
Better yet, trust Sam.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.676
It's not by pretending
that death doesn't exist

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.516
that we keep the people,

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.956
especially the little people that we love,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.180
safe.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.436
In the end,

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.676
we can't control how long any of us lives.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.436
What we can control

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.076
is how we spend our days,

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.820
the spaces we create,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.180
the meaning and joy that we make.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.756
We cannot change the outcome,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.700
but we can change the journey.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.940
Isn't it time

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.076
to recognize that children deserve

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.476
nothing less than our
most uncompromising bravery

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.860
and our wildest imagination.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.076
Thank you.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.660
(Applause)
