00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.176
Have you ever noticed
when you ask someone to talk

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.536
about a change they're making
for the better in their personal lives,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.520
they're often really energetic?

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.496
Whether it's training for a marathon,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.776
picking up an old hobby,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.656
or learning a new skill,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.936
for most people,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.200
self-transformation projects
occupy a very positive emotional space.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.176
Self-transformation is empowering,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.536
energizing, even exhilarating.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.336
I mean just take a look
at some of the titles of self-help books:

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.056
"Awaken the Giant Within,"

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.576
"Practicing the Power of Now,"

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.056
or here's a great one
we can all relate to,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.296
"You are a Badass:

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.416
How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness
and Start Living an Awesome Life."

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.640
(Laughter)

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.560
When it comes to self-transformation,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.800
you can't help but get
a sense of the excitement.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.016
But there's another type of transformation

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.120
that occupies a very different
emotional space.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.680
The transformation of organizations.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.216
If you're like most people,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.616
when you hear the words "Our organization
is going to start a transformation,"

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.040
you're thinking, "Uh-oh."

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:28.576
(Laughter)

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
"Layoffs."

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.736
The blood drains from your face,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.616
your mind goes into overdrive,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880
frantically searching
for some place to run and hide.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.616
Well, you can run,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920
but you really can't hide.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.016
Most of us spend
the majority of our waking hours

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560
involved in organizations.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.136
And due to changes in globalization,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.696
changes due to advances in technology

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.536
and other factors,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.480
the reality is our organizations
are constantly having to adapt.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.576
In fact,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.480
I call this the era
of "always-on" transformation.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.656
When I shared this idea
with my wife Nicola,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.816
she said, "Always-on transformation?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.920
That sounds exhausting."

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.936
And that may be
exactly what you're thinking --

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.536
and you would be right.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.696
Particularly if we continue to approach
the transformation of organizations

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.080
the way we always have been.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.336
But because we can't hide,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.056
we need to sort out two things.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.296
First,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.056
why is transformation so exhausting?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
And second, how do we fix it?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.416
First of all,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.576
let's acknowledge that change is hard.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.616
People naturally resist change,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.280
especially when it's imposed on them.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.776
But there are things that organizations do
that make change even harder

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.640
and more exhausting
for people than it needs to be.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.936
First of all,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.400
leaders often wait too long to act.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.256
As a result,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.720
everything is happening in crisis mode.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.338
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.456
Or, given the urgency,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.400
what they'll do is they'll just focus
on the short-term results,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.480
but that doesn't give
any hope for the future.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.280
Or they'll just take
a superficial, one-off approach,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.136
hoping that they can return
back to business as usual

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.760
as soon as the crisis is over.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.816
This kind of approach

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.920
is kind of the way some students
approach preparing for standardized tests.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.736
In order to get test scores to go up,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.360
teachers will end up teaching to the test.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.536
Now, that approach can work;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.496
test results often do go up.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.296
But it fails the fundamental
goal of education:

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.440
to prepare students
to succeed over the long term.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.200
So given these obstacles,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.976
what can we do

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.456
to transform the way
we transform organizations

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.440
so rather than being exhausting,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.040
it's actually empowering and energizing?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.176
To do that, we need to focus
on five strategic imperatives,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.935
all of which have one thing in common:

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.240
putting people first.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.736
The first imperative
for putting people first

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.520
is to inspire through purpose.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.816
Most transformations have
financial and operational goals.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.096
These are important
and they can be energizing to leaders,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.680
but they tend not to be very motivating
to most people in the organization.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.256
To motivate more broadly,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.680
the transformation needs to connect
with a deeper sense of purpose.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.920
Take LEGO.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.880
The LEGO Group has become
an extraordinary global company.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.256
Under their very capable leadership,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.120
they've actually undergone
a series of transformations.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.016
While each of these
has had a very specific focus,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.336
the North Star,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.176
linking and guiding all of them,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.640
has been Lego's powerful purpose:

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.240
inspire and develop
the builders of tomorrow.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.560
Expanding globally?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.576
It's not about increasing sales,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.240
but about giving millions of additional
children access to LEGO building bricks.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.360
Investment and innovation?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.818
It's not about developing new products,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.656
but about enabling more children

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.200
to experience the joy
of learning through play.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.976
Not surprisingly,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.080
that deep sense of purpose tends
to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.056
The second imperative
for putting people first

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.800
is to go all in.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.776
Too many transformations

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.536
are nothing more than
head-count cutting exercises;

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.040
layoffs under the guise of transformation.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.016
In the face of relentless competition,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.976
it may well be that you will
have to take the painful decision

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.856
to downsize the organization,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.560
just as you may have to lose some weight
in order to run a marathon.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.216
But losing weight alone

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.080
will not get you across
the finish line with a winning time.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.760
To win

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.640
you need to go all in.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.920
You need to go all in.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.000
Rather than just cutting costs,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.176
you need to think about initiatives

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.896
that will enable you
to win in the medium term,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.896
initiatives to drive growth,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.976
actions that will fundamentally
change the way the company operates,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.536
and very importantly,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.200
investments to develop
the leadership and the talent.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.456
The third imperative
for putting people first

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.176
is to enable people with the capabilities

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.040
that they need to succeed
during the transformation and beyond.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.520
Over the years I've competed
in a number of triathlons.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.456
You know, frankly, I'm not that good,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.496
but I do have one distinct capability;

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.200
I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.536
(Laughter)

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.376
By the time I finish the swim,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.256
almost all the bikes are already gone.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.760
(Laughter)

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.216
Real triathletes know that each leg --

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.976
the swim, the bike, the run --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.496
really requires different capabilities,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.736
different tools,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.416
different skills, different techniques.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.896
Likewise when we transform organizations,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.776
we need to be sure
that we're giving our people

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.600
the skills and the tools
they need along the way.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.376
Chronos,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.376
a global software company,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.336
recognized the need
to transfer from building products --

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.016
software products --

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.800
to building software as a service.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.016
To enable its people
to take that transformation,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.736
first of all they invested in new tools

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.816
that would enable their employees
to monitor the usage of the features

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.600
as well as customer satisfaction
with the new service.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.976
They also invested in skill development,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.816
so that their employees would be able

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.320
to resolve customer service
problems on the spot.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.176
And very importantly,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.576
they also reinforced the collaborative
behaviors that would be required

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.640
to deliver an end-to-end
seamless customer experience.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:46.256
Because of these investments,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.616
rather than feeling overwhelmed
by the transformation,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.895
Chronos employees actually felt energized

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:55.000
and empowered in their new roles.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.416
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.936
change is a constant.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.896
My fourth imperative therefore

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.720
is to instill a culture
of continuous learning.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.816
When Satya Nadella
became the CEO of Microsoft

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.776
in February 2014,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.696
he embarked on an ambitious
transformation journey

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.920
to prepare the company to compete
in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.936
This included changes to strategy,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.176
the organization

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.880
and very importantly, the culture.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.600
Microsoft's culture at the time was one
of silos and internal competition --

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.520
not exactly conducive to learning.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.320
Nadella took this head-on.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.976
He rallied his leadership
around his vision

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.520
for a living, learning culture,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.576
shifting from a fixed mindset,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.976
where your role was to show up
as the smartest person in the room,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.816
to a growth mindset,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.320
where your role was to listen, to learn
and to bring out the best in people.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.976
Well, early days,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.120
Microsoft employees already
noticed this shift in the culture --

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.480
clear evidence of Microsoft
putting people first.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.120
My fifth and final imperative
is specifically for leaders.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.856
In a transformation,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.440
a leader needs to have a vision,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.800
a clear road map with milestones,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.056
and then you need to hold people
accountable for results.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.033
In other words, you need to be directive.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.376
But in order to capture
the hearts and minds of people,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.800
you also need to be inclusive.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.440
Inclusive leadership
is critical to putting people first.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.720
I live in the San Francisco Bay area.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.896
And right now,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.400
our basketball team
is the best in the league.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.616
We won the 2015 championship,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.880
and we're favored to win again this year.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.656
There are many explanations for this.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.400
They have some fabulous players,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.896
but one of the key reasons

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.360
is their head coach, Steve Kerr,
is an inclusive leader.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.976
When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.680
the Warriors were looking
for a major transformation.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.960
They hadn't won a national
championship since 1975.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.816
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.240
and he immediately got to work.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.816
From the outset,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.936
he reached out and engaged
the players and the staff.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.240
He created an environment of open debate
and solicited suggestions.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.056
During games he would often ask,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.960
"What are you seeing that I'm missing?"

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.760
One the best examples of this
came in game four of the 2015 finals.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.720
The Warriors were down two games to one

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.040
when Kerr made the decision
to change the starting lineup;

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.000
a bold move by any measure.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.280
The Warriors won the game
and went on to win the championship.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.216
And it is widely viewed

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.920
that that move was
the pivotal move in their victory.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.120
Interestingly, it wasn't
actually Kerr's idea.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.160
It was the idea of his 28-year-old
assistant, Nick U'Ren.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.336
Because of Kerr's leadership style,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.200
U'Ren felt comfortable
bringing the idea forward.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.216
And Kerr not only listened,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.800
but he implemented the idea

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.176
and then afterwards,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.160
gave U'Ren all the credit --

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.040
actions all consistent with Kerr's
highly inclusive approach to leadership.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.936
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.640
organizations are always
going to be transforming.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.440
But doing so does not
have to be exhausting.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.256
We owe it to ourselves,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.256
to our organizations

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.000
and to society more broadly

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.840
to boldly transform
our approach to transformation.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.576
To do that,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.080
we need to start putting people first.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.016
Thank you.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.992
(Applause)
