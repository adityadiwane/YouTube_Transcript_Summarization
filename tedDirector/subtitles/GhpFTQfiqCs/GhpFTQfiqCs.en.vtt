00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:15.351
Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.907
So he's Mario. He's our son.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.766
He was born two and a half years ago,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.979
and I had a pretty tough pregnancy

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:29.129
because I had to stay still
in a bed for, like, eight months.

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:32.188
But in the end everything
seemed to be under control.

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:35.042
So he got the right weight at birth.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.189
He got the right Apgar index.

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:40.274
So we were pretty reassured by this.

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:47.126
But at the end, 10 days
later after he was born,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.673
we discovered that he had a stroke.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:51.543
As you might know,

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.109
a stroke is a brain injury.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.819
A perinatal stroke could be something

00:00:56.843 --> 00:01:00.734
that can happen
during the nine months of pregnancy

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.326
or just suddenly after the birth,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.223
and in his case, as you can see,

00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:10.415
the right part of his brain has gone.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.906
So the effect that this stroke
could have on Mario's body

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.150
could be the fact that he couldn't
be able to control

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.926
the left side of his body.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.751
Just imagine, if you have
a computer and a printer

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.940
and you want to transmit,
to input to print out a document,

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:33.384
but the printer doesn't
have the right drives,

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:36.168
so the same is for Mario.

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:39.188
It's just like,
he would like to move his left side

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.131
of his body, but he's not able
to transmit the right input

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:48.011
to move his left arm and left leg.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:50.253
So life had to change.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.292
We needed to change our schedule.

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:58.203
We needed to change the impact
that this birth had

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.914
on our life.

00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:02.916
Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.212
unfortunately, we were not ready.

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:09.267
Nobody taught us how to deal
with such kinds of disabilities,

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.354
and as many questions as possible started

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:13.286
to come to our minds.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.315
And that has been really a tough time.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.612
Questions, some basics, like, you know,

00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:20.792
why did this happen to us?

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.787
And what went wrong?

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:25.290
Some more tough, like, really,

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:26.997
what will be the impact on Mario's life?

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.117
I mean, at the end,
will he be able to work?

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:30.571
Will he be able to be normal?

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.796
And, you know, as a parent,
especially for the first time,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.238
why is he not going to be better than us?

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:40.516
And this, indeed, really is tough to say,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.304
but a few months later, we realized that

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:46.564
we were really feeling like a failure.

00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:49.585
I mean, the only real product of our life,

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.425
at the end, was a failure.

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:57.351
And you know, it was not a failure
for ourselves in itself,

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:02.089
but it was a failure
that will impact his full life.

00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:03.863
Honestly, we went down.

00:03:03.887 --> 00:03:07.398
I mean we went really
down, but at the end,

00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:09.292
we started to look at him,

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:11.541
and we said, we have to react.

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:14.419
So immediately, as Francesca
said, we changed our life.

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:17.876
We started physiotherapy,
we started the rehabilitation,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.948
and one of the paths
that we were following

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:22.953
in terms of rehabilitation
is the mirror neurons pilot.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:26.744
Basically, we spent months
doing this with Mario.

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:29.589
You have an object, and we showed him

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:31.610
how to grab the object.

00:03:31.634 --> 00:03:34.194
Now, the theory of mirror
neurons simply says

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:38.366
that in your brains, exactly
now, as you watch me doing this,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.876
you are activating
exactly the same neurons

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.113
as if you do the actions.

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:48.109
It looks like this is the leading
edge in terms of rehabilitation.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:51.961
But one day we found that Mario

00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:55.336
was not looking at our hand.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.910
He was looking at us.

00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:00.105
We were his mirror.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.153
And the problem, as you might feel,

00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:04.598
is that we were down, we were depressed,

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.970
we were looking at him as a problem,

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:11.475
not as a son, not
from a positive perspective.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.715
And that day really
changed our perspective.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.035
We realized that we had to become

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:20.602
a better mirror for Mario.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.690
We restarted from our strengths,

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:26.393
and at the same time
we restarted from his strengths.

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:29.091
We stopped looking at him as a problem,

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:33.491
and we started to look at him
as an opportunity to improve.

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:36.049
And really, this was the change,

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:39.208
and from our side, we said,

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.355
"What are our strengths
that we really can bring to Mario?"

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.951
And we started from our passions.

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.785
I mean, at the end, my wife and myself

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.009
are quite different,

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.097
but we have many things in common.

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.319
We love to travel, we love music,

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:53.160
we love to be in places like this,

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:55.245
and we started to bring Mario with us

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:59.943
just to show to him the best
things that we can show to him.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:05.144
This short video is from last week.

00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:06.749
I am not saying --

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.594
(Applause) —

00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:11.238
I am not saying it's a miracle.
That's not the message,

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:13.787
because we are just
at the beginning of the path.

00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.409
But we want to share
what was the key learning,

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.691
the key learning that Mario drove to us,

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.035
and it is to consider
what you have as a gift

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:26.723
and not only what you miss,

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:30.916
and to consider what you
miss just as an opportunity.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.560
And this is the message
that we want to share with you.

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:37.296
This is why we are here.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.211
Mario!

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:40.974
And this is why --

00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:45.576
(Applause) —

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.798
And this is why

00:05:50.822 --> 00:05:56.284
we decided to share the best
mirror in the world with him.

00:05:56.308 --> 00:05:59.218
And we thank you so much, all of you.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:01.341
FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.

00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:05.178
(Applause)

00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:10.172
FF: Thank you. (Applause)
