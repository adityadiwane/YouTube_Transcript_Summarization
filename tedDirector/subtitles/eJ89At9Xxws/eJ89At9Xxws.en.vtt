00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Restaurants and the food industry in general

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
are pretty much the most wasteful industry

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in the world.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
10 calories are taken to produce it.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
That's a lot.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
I want to take something rather humble

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to discuss.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I found this in the farmers' market today,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The humble potato --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And it pretty much goes through

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
eight different forms in its lifetime.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It grows and is nurtured.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
It's then harvested.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It's then distributed,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and distribution is a massive issue.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
It's then sold and bought,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and it's then delivered to me.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I basically take it, prepare it,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
The last stage is basically waste,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
There are different types of waste.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and there's a waste of waste.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And every business I've been working on

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
over the past five years,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Basically a restaurant just like any other.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
This is the restaurant, Acorn House.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Front and back.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
So let me run you through a few ideas.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Floor: sustainable, recyclable.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Chairs: recycled and recyclable.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Tables: Forestry Commission.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
she didn't like sitting on it,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
reusing, a job that was pretty good.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I hate waste, especially walls.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and that shows all the customers my products.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
The whole business is run on sustainable energy.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Paint is all low-volume chemical,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
but there's a work surface there.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And that's a plastic polymer.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
experiment with polymers.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Will they outlive me? They probably might.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Now reusing is vital.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And we filter our own water.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Here's a great little example.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
which has been turned inside out and sewn up.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I basically created a menu that allowed people

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
to choose the amount and volume of food

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
that they wanted to consume.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Rather than me putting a dish down,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
It serves 220 people a day.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
We generate quite a lot of waste.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
This is the waste room.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
You can't get rid of waste.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
In here, I have produce and boxes

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that are unavoidable.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
turns food into an inner material,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
which I can store and then compost later.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I compost it in this garden.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
which is generated by the restaurant,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and wine casks and all kinds of things.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Three compost bins --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
really good, makes fantastic compost.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
A couple of wormeries in there too.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And actually one of the wormeries

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And I tried taking the dried food waste,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It was like vegetable jerky,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and killed all of them.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I don't know how many worms [were] in there,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
(Laughter)

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
This takes the water out of the restaurant,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and I sort of water the garden with it.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So, water is a very important aspect.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I started meditating on that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
I managed to do it.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
same chairs, same tables.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
But this is an electrical restaurant.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And it's run on hydroelectricity,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
so I've gone from air to water.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now it's important to understand

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
that this room

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
is cooled by water, heated by water,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
filters its own water,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and it's powered by water.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It literally is Waterhouse.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
The air handling system inside it --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I got rid of air-conditioning

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
This is basically air-handling.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And this is an English willow air diffuser,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and that's softly moving

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that air current through the room.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
This takes the temperature of the canal

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
(Laughter)

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
There's no accident in names of these restaurants.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
five restaurants based

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I've got metal and earth to come.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So you've got to watch your space for that.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Okay. So this is my next project.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Five weeks old,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
The People's Supermarket.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So basically, the restaurants only really hit

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
people who believed in what I was doing anyway.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
What I needed to do was get food out

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
to a broader spectrum of people.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This is a social enterprise,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
It really is about the social disconnect

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
between food, communities

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
in urban settings

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and their relationship to rural growers --

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
connecting communities in London to rural growers.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Really important.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
the most sustainable supermarket in the world.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
That's zero food waste.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And no one's doing that just yet.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
let's have a go. Try it on.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I'm going to get there before you.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
So nature doesn't create waste

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
doesn't create waste as such.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
with waste being the end of the beginning,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and it's an important statement to understand.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
If we don't stand up

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and make a difference

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and think about sustainable food,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
think about the sustainable nature of it,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
then we may fail.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
But, I wanted to get up and show you

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
that we can do it if we're more responsible.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
They're here. You can see I've done three so far;

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I've got a few more to go.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
The idea is embryonic.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I think it's important.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and recycle -- right at the end there --

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
recycling is the last point I want to make;

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
then I think we're going to be on our way.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I think that there are many problems to come,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And I hope you all take part.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Thank you very much. (Applause)
