00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.422
That's how we traveled in the year 1900.

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:17.791
That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.420
It doesn't have air conditioning.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.477
That horse is pulling it along

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:23.775
at one percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.527
and the rutted dirt road

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:29.909
turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.654
That's a Boeing 707.

00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:34.955
Only 60 years later, it travels

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.172
at 80 percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:39.805
and we don't travel any faster today

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.944
because commercial supersonic air travel

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:44.913
turned out to be a bust.

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.465
So I started wondering and pondering,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.487
could it be that the best years of American economic growth

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.146
are behind us?

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:56.625
And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.852
is almost over.

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:02.614
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:04.988
There are four headwinds that are just hitting

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:07.373
the American economy in the face.

00:01:07.373 --> 00:01:12.031
They're demographics, education, debt and inequality.

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.664
They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:20.322
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:23.090
And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.771
if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been

00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.638
in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:32.349
If innovation is less powerful,

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.803
invents less great, wonderful things,

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.813
then growth is going to be even lower than half of history.

00:01:38.813 --> 00:01:41.968
Now here's eight centuries of economic growth.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.632
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:48.755
zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.655
The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:54.186
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.677
when the line switches to red.

00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:57.663
You'll notice that, for the first four centuries,

00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:01.533
there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.152
Then growth gets better and better.

00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:06.130
It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.887
and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:12.383
That last downward notch in the red line

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:14.614
is not actual data.

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:17.754
That is a forecast that I made six years ago

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:20.383
that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:22.393
But you know what the actual facts are?

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.206
You know what the growth in per-person income has been

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.098
in the United States in the last six years?

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.438
Negative.

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:31.709
This led to a fantasy.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.955
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:40.923
I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:43.717
but I decided I would end it at 0.2,

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:48.542
just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:51.906
Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:55.967
at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:59.155
1891 to 2007,

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.779
and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.084
But if growth slows down,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:09.067
instead of doubling our standard of living every generation,

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.905
Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:16.875
or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:21.240
Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.604
The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.180
You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.910
we were at about 5,000 dollars.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.815
Today we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:34.482
per member of the population.

00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:36.900
Now what if we could achieve that historic

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.883
two-percent growth for the next 70 years?

00:03:39.883 --> 00:03:41.215
Well, it's a matter of arithmetic.

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:45.355
Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:49.056
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:51.507
Well, we're not going to do that,

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.333
and the reason is the headwinds.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.974
The first headwind is demographics.

00:03:54.974 --> 00:03:57.312
It's a truism that your standard of living

00:03:57.312 --> 00:04:00.824
rises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.434
if hours per person increased.

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:05.936
And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:08.454
when women entered the labor force.

00:04:08.454 --> 00:04:10.691
But now it's turned around.

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.891
Now hours per person are shrinking,

00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:15.765
first because of the retirement of the baby boomers,

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:19.919
and second because there's been a very significant

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.916
dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:27.854
who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.

00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:30.015
The next headwind is education.

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:32.660
We've got problems all over our educational system

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.181
despite Race to the Top.

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.263
In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education

00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:41.175
that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:45.431
We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,

00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:48.418
and our college completion rate

00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:55.369
is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:57.476
We have a lot of debt.

00:04:57.476 --> 00:05:02.458
Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:05.690
on the back of consumers massively overborrowing.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.626
Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:11.362
why our economic recovery is so sluggish today.

00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:12.948
And everybody of course knows

00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:15.077
that the federal government debt is growing

00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:18.406
as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:21.568
and the only way that's going to stop is some combination

00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:26.645
of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,

00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:28.730
also called transfer payments.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.899
And that gets us down from the 1.5,

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.300
where we've reached for education, down to 1.3.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.718
And then we have inequality.

00:05:36.718 --> 00:05:39.471
Over the 15 years before the financial crisis,

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:42.737
the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:45.860
of the income distribution was half a point slower

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.636
than the averages we've been talking about before.

00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:50.922
All the rest went to the top one percent.

00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:53.274
So that brings us down to 0.8.

00:05:53.274 --> 00:05:56.649
And that 0.8 is the big challenge.

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:58.863
Are we going to grow at 0.8?

00:05:58.863 --> 00:06:01.318
If so, that's going to require that our inventions

00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:03.665
are as important as the ones that happened

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:06.583
over the last 150 years.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:10.622
So let's see what some of those inventions were.

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:14.124
If you wanted to read in 1875 at night,

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.446
you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:19.603
They created pollution, they created odors,

00:06:19.603 --> 00:06:22.008
they were hard to control, the light was dim,

00:06:22.008 --> 00:06:24.156
and they were a fire hazard.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:29.251
By 1929, electric light was everywhere.

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:33.400
We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.385
Central Manhattan became possible.

00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:39.632
And then, in addition to that, at the same time,

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:43.128
hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools

00:06:43.128 --> 00:06:45.836
and hand-powered electric tools,

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:48.694
all achieved by electricity.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:52.907
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women.

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:55.595
Women, back in the late 19th century,

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:58.251
spent two days a week doing the laundry.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.966
They did it on a scrub board.

00:06:59.966 --> 00:07:02.034
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry.

00:07:02.034 --> 00:07:03.566
Then they had to bring them in.

00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:06.519
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:10.106
And then we had the electric washing machine.

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:13.180
And by 1950, they were everywhere.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.208
But the women still had to shop every day,

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:18.500
but no they didn't, because electricity

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.401
brought us the electric refrigerator.

00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:24.593
Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes

00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:29.122
was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.

00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:31.438
The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.

00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:34.118
But by 1929, certainly by 1950,

00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:38.010
we had central heating everywhere.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.602
What about the internal combustion engine,

00:07:40.602 --> 00:07:42.942
which was invented in 1879?

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:46.760
In America, before the motor vehicle,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.732
transportation depended entirely on the urban horse,

00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:53.618
which dropped, without restraint,

00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:57.423
25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day

00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:59.347
together with a gallon of urine.

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:02.560
That comes out at five to 10 tons daily

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.993
per square mile in cities.

00:08:04.993 --> 00:08:10.934
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.332
That's the percentage of American agricultural land

00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:15.525
it took to feed the horses.

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:19.487
Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented,

00:08:19.487 --> 00:08:22.691
and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.786
that agricultural land could be used for human consumption

00:08:25.786 --> 00:08:27.320
or for export.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.960
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.876
only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households

00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:42.460
in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.271
Back before the turn of the century,

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:46.672
women had another problem.

00:08:46.672 --> 00:08:51.267
All the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:55.937
had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.

00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:58.412
It's a historical fact that in 1885,

00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:00.726
the average North Carolina housewife

00:09:00.726 --> 00:09:06.096
walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.

00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:10.500
But by 1929, cities around the country

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.515
had put in underground water pipes.

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:16.941
They had put in underground sewer pipes,

00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:22.123
and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,

00:09:22.123 --> 00:09:26.369
waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.

00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:29.971
And an amazing fact for techno-optimists

00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.543
is that in the first half of the 20th century,

00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:35.255
the rate of improvement of life expectancy

00:09:35.255 --> 00:09:38.056
was three times faster than it was

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.927
in the second half of the 19th century.

00:09:40.927 --> 00:09:46.013
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.

00:09:46.013 --> 00:09:48.195
And I'll just give you a few examples.

00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:51.463
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.

00:09:51.463 --> 00:09:55.071
Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,

00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:57.434
they all went from zero to 100 percent.

00:09:57.434 --> 00:10:01.084
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm.

00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:03.926
We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent

00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:08.054
by the early postwar years.

00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:10.297
What about the electronic revolution?

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.418
Here's an early computer.

00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:15.728
It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.

00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:20.281
By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements

00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.052
were being produced by computers.

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:24.916
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.831
were invented in the 1970s.

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:31.086
The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:33.871
ATM machines to replace bank tellers,

00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.764
bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:39.631
Fast forward through the '90s,

00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.199
we had the dotcom revolution

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:44.323
and a temporary rise in productivity growth.

00:10:44.323 --> 00:10:46.775
But I'm now going to give you an experiment.

00:10:46.775 --> 00:10:49.863
You have to choose either option A or option B.

00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:52.378
(Laughter)

00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:55.719
Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.

00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:58.629
So you get Google, you get Amazon,

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:01.716
you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:03.545
Or you get everything invented to yesterday,

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:05.621
including Facebook and your iPhone,

00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:07.980
but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.844
and carry in the water.

00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:14.294
Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,

00:11:14.294 --> 00:11:15.817
maybe for a couple of days,

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:17.943
in some cases for more than a week,

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:21.483
electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,

00:11:21.483 --> 00:11:24.399
and a charge for their iPhones.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:27.910
The problem we face is that all these great inventions,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.914
we have to match them in the future,

00:11:30.914 --> 00:11:33.502
and my prediction that we're not going to match them

00:11:33.502 --> 00:11:36.697
brings us down from the original two-percent growth

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:41.767
down to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.774
So here we are back to the horse and buggy.

00:11:44.774 --> 00:11:47.095
I'd like to award an Oscar

00:11:47.095 --> 00:11:50.748
to the inventors of the 20th century,

00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:53.489
the people from Alexander Graham Bell

00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:55.192
to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,

00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.915
I'd like to call them all up here,

00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:58.785
and they're going to call back to you.

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:02.448
Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved?

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:03.982
Thank you.

00:12:03.982 --> 00:12:09.013
(Applause)
