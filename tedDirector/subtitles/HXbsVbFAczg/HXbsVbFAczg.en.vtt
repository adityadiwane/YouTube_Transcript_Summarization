00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.716
Whether you like it or not,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.116
radical transparency and algorithmic
decision-making is coming at you fast,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.116
and it's going to change your life.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.956
That's because it's now easy
to take algorithms

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.876
and embed them into computers

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.836
and gather all that data
that you're leaving on yourself

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.236
all over the place,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.956
and know what you're like,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.916
and then direct the computers
to interact with you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.060
in ways that are better
than most people can.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.596
Well, that might sound scary.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.260
I've been doing this for a long time
and I have found it to be wonderful.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.636
My objective has been
to have meaningful work

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.516
and meaningful relationships
with the people I work with,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.596
and I've learned that I couldn't have that

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.900
unless I had that radical transparency
and that algorithmic decision-making.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.516
I want to show you why that is,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.236
I want to show you how it works.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.356
And I warn you that some of the things
that I'm going to show you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.047
probably are a little bit shocking.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.060
Since I was a kid,
I've had a terrible rote memory.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.116
And I didn't like following instructions,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.556
I was no good at following instructions.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
But I loved to figure out
how things worked for myself.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.876
When I was 12,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.180
I hated school but I fell in love
with trading the markets.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.396
I caddied at the time,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.996
earned about five dollars a bag.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.220
And I took my caddying money,
and I put it in the stock market.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.436
And that was just because
the stock market was hot at the time.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.916
And the first company I bought

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.540
was a company by the name
of Northeast Airlines.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.916
Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.636
that was selling for less
than five dollars a share.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.636
(Laughter)

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.516
And I figured I could buy more shares,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.636
and if it went up, I'd make more money.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.500
So, it was a dumb strategy, right?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.636
But I tripled my money,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.780
and I tripled my money
because I got lucky.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.156
The company was about to go bankrupt,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.276
but some other company acquired it,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.756
and I tripled my money.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.980
And I was hooked.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.820
And I thought, "This game is easy."

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.236
With time,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.220
I learned this game is anything but easy.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.836
In order to be an effective investor,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.756
one has to bet against the consensus

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.036
and be right.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.916
And it's not easy to bet
against the consensus and be right.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.276
One has to bet against
the consensus and be right

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.940
because the consensus
is built into the price.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.396
And in order to be an entrepreneur,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.036
a successful entrepreneur,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.540
one has to bet against
the consensus and be right.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.156
I had to be an entrepreneur
and an investor --

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.380
and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.076
So I made a lot of painful mistakes,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.356
and with time,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.340
my attitude about those mistakes
began to change.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.076
I began to think of them as puzzles.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.036
That if I could solve the puzzles,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.500
they would give me gems.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.636
And the puzzles were:

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.540
What would I do differently in the future
so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.676
And the gems were principles

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.836
that I would then write down
so I would remember them

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.432
that would help me in the future.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.516
And because I wrote them down so clearly,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.876
I could then --

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.476
eventually discovered --

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.260
I could then embed them into algorithms.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.676
And those algorithms
would be embedded in computers,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.036
and the computers would
make decisions along with me;

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.196
and so in parallel,
we would make these decisions.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.196
And I could see how those decisions
then compared with my own decisions,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.316
and I could see that
those decisions were a lot better.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.076
And that was because the computer
could make decisions much faster,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.356
it could process a lot more information

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.780
and it can process decisions much more --

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.900
less emotionally.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.500
So it radically improved
my decision-making.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.156
Eight years after I started Bridgewater,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.716
I had my greatest failure,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.940
my greatest mistake.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.636
It was late 1970s,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.636
I was 34 years old,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.316
and I had calculated that American banks

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.196
had lent much more money
to emerging countries

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.036
than those countries
were going to be able to pay back

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.756
and that we would have
the greatest debt crisis

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.140
since the Great Depression.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.236
And with it, an economic crisis

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.300
and a big bear market in stocks.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
It was a controversial view at the time.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.420
People thought it was
kind of a crazy point of view.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.516
But in August 1982,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.500
Mexico defaulted on its debt,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.596
and a number of other countries followed.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.020
And we had the greatest debt crisis
since the Great Depression.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.676
And because I had anticipated that,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.036
I was asked to testify to Congress
and appear on "Wall Street Week,"

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.036
which was the show of the time.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.996
Just to give you a flavor of that,
I've got a clip here,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.940
and you'll see me in there.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.996
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.396
it's a great pleasure and a great honor
to be able to appear before you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.900
in examination with what
is going wrong with our economy.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.396
The economy is now flat --

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.556
teetering on the brink of failure.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.076
Martin Zweig: You were recently
quoted in an article.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.436
You said, "I can say this
with absolute certainty

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.076
because I know how markets work."

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.196
Ray Dalio: I can say
with absolute certainty

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.076
that if you look at the liquidity base

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.476
in the corporations
and the world as a whole,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.596
that there's such reduced
level of liquidity

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.836
that you can't return
to an era of stagflation."

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.956
I look at that now, I think,
"What an arrogant jerk!"

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.980
(Laughter)

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.036
I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.636
I mean, while the debt crisis happened,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.636
the stock market and the economy
went up rather than going down,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.676
and I lost so much money
for myself and for my clients

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.116
that I had to shut down
my operation pretty much,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.020
I had to let almost everybody go.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.196
And these were like extended family,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.836
I was heartbroken.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.676
And I had lost so much money

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.036
that I had to borrow
4,000 dollars from my dad

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.980
to help to pay my family bills.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.820
It was one of the most painful
experiences of my life ...

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.836
but it turned out to be
one of the greatest experiences of my life

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.540
because it changed my attitude
about decision-making.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.236
Rather than thinking, "I'm right,"

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.836
I started to ask myself,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.660
"How do I know I'm right?"

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.236
I gained a humility that I needed

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.820
in order to balance my audacity.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.916
I wanted to find the smartest
people who would disagree with me

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.836
to try to understand their perspective

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.460
or to have them
stress test my perspective.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.996
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.236
In other words,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.076
not an autocracy in which
I would lead and others would follow

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.716
and not a democracy in which everybody's
points of view were equally valued,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.836
but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy
in which the best ideas would win out.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.116
And in order to do that,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.716
I realized that we would need
radical truthfulness

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.356
and radical transparency.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.236
What I mean by radical truthfulness
and radical transparency

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.916
is people needed to say
what they really believed

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.940
and to see everything.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.236
And we literally
tape almost all conversations

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.876
and let everybody see everything,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.316
because if we didn't do that,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.420
we couldn't really have
an idea meritocracy.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.276
In order to have an idea meritocracy,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.676
we have let people speak
and say what they want.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.076
Just to give you an example,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.796
this is an email from Jim Haskel --

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.196
somebody who works for me --

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.596
and this was available
to everybody in the company.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.156
"Ray, you deserve a 'D-'

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.436
for your performance
today in the meeting ...

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.156
you did not prepare at all well

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.740
because there is no way
you could have been that disorganized."

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.556
Isn't that great?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.796
(Laughter)

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.036
That's great.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.996
It's great because, first of all,
I needed feedback like that.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.636
I need feedback like that.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.116
And it's great because if I don't let Jim,
and people like Jim,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.716
to express their points of view,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.796
our relationship wouldn't be the same.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.876
And if I didn't make that public
for everybody to see,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.860
we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.860
So for that last 25 years
that's how we've been operating.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.516
We've been operating
with this radical transparency

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.836
and then collecting these principles,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.916
largely from making mistakes,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.356
and then embedding
those principles into algorithms.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.076
And then those algorithms provide --

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.116
we're following the algorithms

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.580
in parallel with our thinking.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.276
That has been how we've run
the investment business,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.036
and it's how we also deal
with the people management.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.796
In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.156
I'd like to take you into a meeting

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.316
and introduce you to a tool of ours
called the "Dot Collector"

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.620
that helps us do this.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.636
A week after the US election,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.756
our research team held a meeting

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.100
to discuss what a Trump presidency
would mean for the US economy.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.676
Naturally, people had
different opinions on the matter

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.740
and how we were
approaching the discussion.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.436
The "Dot Collector" collects these views.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.756
It has a list of a few dozen attributes,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.796
so whenever somebody thinks something
about another person's thinking,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.756
it's easy for them
to convey their assessment;

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.300
they simply note the attribute
and provide a rating from one to 10.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.596
For example, as the meeting began,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.740
a researcher named Jen rated me a three --

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.476
in other words, badly --

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.876
(Laughter)

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.060
for not showing a good balance
of open-mindedness and assertiveness.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.356
As the meeting transpired,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.620
Jen's assessments of people
added up like this.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.916
Others in the room
have different opinions.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.156
That's normal.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.100
Different people are always
going to have different opinions.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.020
And who knows who's right?

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.500
Let's look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.636
Some people thought I did well,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.860
others, poorly.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.236
With each of these views,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.580
we can explore the thinking
behind the numbers.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.500
Here's what Jen and Larry said.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.196
Note that everyone
gets to express their thinking,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.876
including their critical thinking,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.020
regardless of their position
in the company.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.036
Jen, who's 24 years old
and right out of college,

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.900
can tell me, the CEO,
that I'm approaching things terribly.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.076
This tool helps people
both express their opinions

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.196
and then separate themselves
from their opinions

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.260
to see things from a higher level.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.356
When Jen and others shift their attentions
from inputting their own opinions

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.956
to looking down on the whole screen,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.700
their perspective changes.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.636
They see their own opinions
as just one of many

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.196
and naturally start asking themselves,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.220
"How do I know my opinion is right?"

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.356
That shift in perspective is like going
from seeing in one dimension

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.636
to seeing in multiple dimensions.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.756
And it shifts the conversation
from arguing over our opinions

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.180
to figuring out objective criteria
for determining which opinions are best.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.340
Behind the "Dot Collector"
is a computer that is watching.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.116
It watches what all
these people are thinking

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.716
and it correlates that
with how they think.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.260
And it communicates advice
back to each of them based on that.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.756
Then it draws the data
from all the meetings

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.996
to create a pointilist painting
of what people are like

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.260
and how they think.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.700
And it does that guided by algorithms.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.380
Knowing what people are like helps
to match them better with their jobs.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.156
For example,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.916
a creative thinker who is unreliable

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.020
might be matched up with someone
who's reliable but not creative.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.436
Knowing what people are like
also allows us to decide

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.716
what responsibilities to give them

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.220
and to weigh our decisions
based on people's merits.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.460
We call it their believability.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.356
Here's an example of a vote that we took

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.220
where the majority
of people felt one way ...

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.676
but when we weighed the views
based on people's merits,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.540
the answer was completely different.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.316
This process allows us to make decisions
not based on democracy,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.476
not based on autocracy,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.740
but based on algorithms that take
people's believability into consideration.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.036
Yup, we really do this.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.356
(Laughter)

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.236
We do it because it eliminates

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.716
what I believe to be
one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.900
and that is people arrogantly,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.036
naïvely holding opinions
in their minds that are wrong,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.316
and acting on them,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.100
and not putting them out there
to stress test them.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.156
And that's a tragedy.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.596
And we do it because it elevates ourselves
above our own opinions

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.516
so that we start to see things
through everybody's eyes,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.460
and we see things collectively.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.516
Collective decision-making is so much
better than individual decision-making

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.740
if it's done well.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.796
It's been the secret sauce
behind our success.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.996
It's why we've made
more money for our clients

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.956
than any other hedge fund in existence

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.700
and made money
23 out of the last 26 years.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.236
So what's the problem
with being radically truthful

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.500
and radically transparent with each other?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.300
People say it's emotionally difficult.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.300
Critics say it's a formula
for a brutal work environment.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.076
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do
with how are brains are prewired.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.316
There's a part of our brain
that would like to know our mistakes

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.300
and like to look at our weaknesses
so we could do better.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.380
I'm told that that's
the prefrontal cortex.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.716
And then there's a part of our brain
which views all of this as attacks.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.700
I'm told that that's the amygdala.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.316
In other words,
there are two you's inside you:

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.756
there's an emotional you

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.556
and there's an intellectual you,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.356
and often they're at odds,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.300
and often they work against you.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.716
It's been our experience
that we can win this battle.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.060
We win it as a group.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.156
It takes about 18 months typically

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.236
to find that most people
prefer operating this way,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.276
with this radical transparency

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.636
than to be operating
in a more opaque environment.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.956
There's not politics,
there's not the brutality of --

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.356
you know, all of that hidden,
behind-the-scenes --

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.316
there's an idea meritocracy
where people can speak up.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.596
And that's been great.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.276
It's given us more effective work,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.700
and it's given us
more effective relationships.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.540
But it's not for everybody.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.436
We found something like
25 or 30 percent of the population

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.196
it's just not for.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.436
And by the way,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.276
when I say radical transparency,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.636
I'm not saying transparency
about everything.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.476
I mean, you don't have to tell somebody
that their bald spot is growing

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.116
or their baby's ugly.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.236
So, I'm just talking about --

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.476
(Laughter)

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.676
talking about the important things.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.916
So --

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.140
(Laughter)

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.836
So when you leave this room,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.300
I'd like you to observe yourself
in conversations with others.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.860
Imagine if you knew
what they were really thinking,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.180
and imagine if you knew
what they were really like ...

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.636
and imagine if they knew
what you were really thinking

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.500
and what were really like.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.556
It would certainly clear things up a lot

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.436
and make your operations
together more effective.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.700
I think it will improve
your relationships.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.716
Now imagine that you can have algorithms

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.556
that will help you gather
all of that information

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.140
and even help you make decisions
in an idea-meritocratic way.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.796
This sort of radical transparency
is coming at you

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.780
and it is going to affect your life.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.476
And in my opinion,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.836
it's going to be wonderful.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.196
So I hope it is as wonderful for you

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.420
as it is for me.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.236
Thank you very much.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.620
(Applause)
