00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, it's great to be here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I've been quite interested in both.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If we could convert 0.03 percent

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
expensive and very inefficient.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are nano-engineered designs,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which at least have been analyzed theoretically,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that show the potential to be very lightweight,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
very inexpensive, very efficient,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Nano-engineered fuel cells

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
could provide the energy where it's needed.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's a key trend, which is decentralization,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
moving from centralized nuclear power plants and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
liquid natural gas tankers

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a lot more efficient

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and capable and safe from disruption.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Bono spoke very eloquently,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that we have the tools, for the first time,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
there were 500 million people living in poverty --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that number now is under 200 million.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which is a reduction of 95 percent.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I did enjoy Bono's comment

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
although we hung around Harvard Square.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That's been a strong interest of mine,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That invariably, the world was a different place

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
when I would introduce a technology.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And, I noticed that most inventions fail,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and track where technology would be at different points in time,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and began to build the mathematical models of that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's kind of taken on a life of its own.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And if you ask me,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that's very hard to say.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Will WiMax CDMA G3

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But if you ask me, what will it cost

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
for one MIPS of computing in 2010,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
it turns out that those are very predictable.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but there's really a theoretical reason

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
why technology develops in an exponential fashion.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
They think they're going to continue

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
to develop a problem

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or address a problem using today's tools,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
at today's pace of progress,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We had our best Ph.D. students,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
our most advanced equipment around the world,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we got 1/10,000th of the project done,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And 10 years into the project,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the skeptics were still going strong -- says, "You're two-thirds through this project,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and you've managed to only sequence

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
a very tiny percentage of the whole genome."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But it's the nature of exponential growth

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Most of the project was done in the last

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
few years of the project.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
we sequenced SARS in 31 days.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm going to show you just a few examples

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of how pervasive this phenomena is.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is doubling every decade, according to our models.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
These are all logarithmic graphs,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the first virtual-reality technology.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
If you put different communication technologies

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
on this logarithmic graph,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
television, radio, telephone

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
were adopted in decades.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
were under a decade.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Now this is an interesting chart,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and this really gets at the fundamental reason why

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
accelerate.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
They work through interaction -- they create a capability,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So the first step in biological evolution,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
took billions of years,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but then evolution used that information-processing backbone

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to bring on the next stage.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And then evolution used those body plans

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to evolve higher cognitive functions,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and biological evolution kept accelerating.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
the species that combined a cognitive function

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
with an opposable appendage --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and fine motor coordination,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and use our mental models to actually change the world

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and bring on technology.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and then working through interaction,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
evolution used, essentially,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
which were the first steps in technological evolution.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And the first step took tens of thousands of years --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We always used then the latest generation of technology

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to create the next generation.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Printing press took a century to be adopted;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that fall on that straight line."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
these were just lists in reference works,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and I think that's what they thought the key events were

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
in biological evolution and technological evolution.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
because people do have disagreements, what the key points are,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But you see a very clear trend.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
every year.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
A personal experience, when I was at MIT --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
computer taking up about the size of this room,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is just one example of many, because it's basically

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
a property of the evolutionary process of technology.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that's another exponential.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Moore's Law was just the last part of that,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but we had electro-mechanical calculators,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
discreet transistors used in the first space flights

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and then Moore's Law.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But by the teen years,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and we won't be able to shrink them any more.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
We will go into the third dimension

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Supercomputers -- same thing.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Processor performance on Intel chips,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the average price of a transistor --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
You could buy 10 million in 2002.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's pretty remarkable how smooth

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
an exponential process that is.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
countries accusing each other of dumping products,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
You would think it would be a very erratic process,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and you have a very smooth

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
outcome of this chaotic process.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Just as we can't predict

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
what one molecule in a gas will do --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
it's hopeless to predict a single molecule --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
using thermodynamics, very accurately.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
but the result of this whole worldwide,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And we can predict these trends far into the future.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
As we make them smaller and less expensive,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the electrons have less distance to travel.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
so the cost of a cycle of one transistor

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You add other forms of innovation and processor design,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And that's basically deflation --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
50 percent deflation.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
it's true of brain scanning;

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we have hundreds of different measurements

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of different, information-related measurements --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
capacity, adoption rates --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
depending on what you're looking at.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And economists have actually started worrying about that. 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We had deflation during the Depression,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but that was collapse of the money supply,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This is due to greater productivity,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
but the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But what we're actually seeing is that

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we actually more than keep up with it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in information technology over the last 50 years.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
As the price performance makes new applications feasible,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
new applications come to the market.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And this is a very widespread phenomena.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Magnetic data storage --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
in these information terms.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We're understanding the software programs

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that make our body run.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
These were evolved in very different times --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
we'd like to actually change those programs.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
basically says, "Hold onto every calorie,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
because the next hunting season may not work out so well."

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We'd like to actually turn that program off.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
without the restriction.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
felt that would be

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
interesting drug for the human market,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and that's just one of the 30,000 genes

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that affect our biochemistry.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
at the age of most people at this conference, like myself,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
which were better deployed towards the children

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and those caring for them.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So, life -- long lifespans --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
like, that is to say, much more than 30 --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
weren't selected for,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
but we are learning to actually manipulate

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and change these software programs

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
through the biotechnology revolution.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in the right place on the chromosome.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There's actually a -- for the first time now,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And this technology is also accelerating.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
then a penny in 2000.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It's now under a 10th of a cent.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The amount of genetic data --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
basically this shows that smooth exponential growth

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
doubled every year,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
enabling the genome project to be completed.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Another major revolution: the communications revolution.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
wired, wireless is growing exponentially.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
measured many different ways.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is based on the number of hosts.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
at an exponential rate,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
both wired and wireless.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
which we're now showing are feasible

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
with super-computing simulations,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
where actually there are scientists building

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
molecule-scale robots.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
that's built out of molecules.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There are little machines doing things in experimental bases.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The most exciting opportunity

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is actually to go inside the human body

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And this is less futuristic than it may sound.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
These things have already been done in animals.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
They put tens of thousands of these

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and actually cures type 1 diabetes.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
What you're watching is a design

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
of a robotic red blood cell,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and it does bring up the issue that our biology

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
is actually very sub-optimal,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Once we understand its principles of operation,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we can actually design these things to be

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
thousands of times more capable.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Presumably we'll ban them,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
These are 2020-circa scenarios,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
there are many experiments in animals.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
There's actually one going into human trial,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
so this is feasible technology.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
If we come back to our exponential growth of computing,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It will intersect human intelligence

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
in terms of capacity in the 2020s,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Where will we get the software?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and in fact not surprisingly,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And with the new generation of scanning tools,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
for the first time we can actually see

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
individual inter-neural fibers

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and see them processing and signaling in real time --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but can we understand it?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and we'd never catch up to it.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It turns out that we can understand it.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
This is a block diagram of

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
that actually works quite well --

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
There's another simulation of the cerebellum --

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
that's more than half the neurons in the brain --

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
again, works very similarly to human skill formation.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
This is at an early stage, but you can show

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
and the exponential improvement

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
in the resolution of brain scanning,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
by the 2020s.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
out of the several hundred.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
All of this is driving

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
exponentially growing economic progress.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
of labor in the last 50 years.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
they figured, well, that was wrong,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and then we had this bust.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
All right, this is a technology

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
It would be able to translate from one language to another.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
By 2010 computers will disappear.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Images will be written directly to our retina,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
providing full-immersion virtual reality,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Computers will combine

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the subtle pan-recognition powers

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
in terms of doing analytic thinking,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
remembering billions of facts accurately.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
We are going to merge with our technology.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
These nano-bots I mentioned

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
will first be used for medical and health applications:

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
But they'll also go inside our brain,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
interact with our biological neurons.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So, for example,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
if you were in the virtual environment,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
with anyone involving all of the senses.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
"Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
But most importantly,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
it'll be a tremendous expansion

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
which in some sense we're doing already.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
We routinely do intellectual feats

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
that would be impossible without our technology.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
this will move up very rapidly

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
in the years ahead.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
My main message is that progress in technology

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
is exponential, not linear.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
so they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
or artificial intelligence."

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
If you really look at the power of exponential growth,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And information technology is increasingly encompassing

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
to our biology to our energy to materials.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
from information, in very inexpensive raw materials,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
using nano-technology.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
These are very powerful technologies.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
They both empower our promise and our peril.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Thank you very much.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
(Applause)
