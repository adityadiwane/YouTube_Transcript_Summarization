00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:19.130
Across Europe and Central Asia,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.690
approximately one million children live in large

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.788
residential institutions, usually known as orphanages.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:28.846
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:30.517
that care for children.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:33.748
Others know more about the living conditions there,

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:36.200
but still think they're a necessary evil.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.597
After all, where else would we put all of those children

00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:41.748
who don't have any parents?

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:45.215
But 60 years of research has demonstrated

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.471
that separating children from their families

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:49.823
and placing them in large institutions

00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:52.663
seriously harms their health and development,

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:56.145
and this is particularly true for young babies.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:58.289
As we know, babies are born

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.049
without their full muscle development,

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.973
and that includes the brain.

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:05.633
During the first three years of life, the brain grows

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.403
to its full size, with most of that growth taking place

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:11.023
in the first six months. The brain develops

00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:14.249
in response to experience and to stimulation.

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:18.063
Every time a young baby learns something new --

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:19.590
to focus its eyes,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.583
to mimic a movement or a facial expression,

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.573
to pick something up, to form a word or to sit up --

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.150
new synaptic connections are being built in the brain.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.249
New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:39.157
They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:41.741
They communicate their delight to their children,

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:43.462
who respond with smiles,

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:47.864
and a desire to achieve more and to learn more.

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:51.606
This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:54.817
provides the building blocks for physical, social,

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:58.327
language, cognitive and psychomotor development.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:02.541
It is the model for all future relationships with friends,

00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:05.782
with partners and with their own children.

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:08.198
It happens so naturally in most families

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:11.302
that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware

00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:14.732
of its importance to human development and, by extension,

00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:17.631
to the development of a healthy society.

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.173
And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.182
the importance of families to children.

00:02:23.182 --> 00:02:27.118
In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:31.276
on a massive scale the impact on children

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:35.679
of institutionalization and the absence of parenting.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.116
Those of us who remember the newspaper reports

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.370
that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.791
will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.550
I was asked to help the director of a large institution to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.513
help prevent the separation of children from their families.

00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:56.698
Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage,

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:59.616
and so I'd been told the conditions were much better.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.066
Having worked with lots of young children, I expected

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.682
the institution to be a riot of noise,

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:06.545
but it was as silent as a convent.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.991
It was hard to believe there were any children there at all,

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.627
yet the director showed me into room after room,

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:15.642
each containing row upon row of cots,

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:21.658
in each of which lay a child staring into space.

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:25.308
In a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:27.347
Yet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see

00:03:27.347 --> 00:03:28.919
that some of the children were distressed,

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.764
but the only noise was a low, continuous moan.

00:03:32.764 --> 00:03:34.864
The head nurse told me proudly,

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:38.085
"You see, our children are very well-behaved."

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.828
Over the next few days, I began to realize

00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:42.891
that this quietness was not exceptional.

00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:46.664
The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours,

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:48.653
but their demands were not met, and so eventually

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:51.331
they learned not to bother. Within a few days,

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.827
they were listless, lethargic, and staring into space

00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:56.653
like all the others.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.570
Over the years, many people and news reports

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.741
have blamed the personnel in the institutions

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.595
for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:09.162
of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.

00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:13.224
Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.

00:04:13.224 --> 00:04:17.099
The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.611
At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member

00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:22.976
may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:26.672
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait

00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:29.631
several hours before it can be changed again.

00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:32.280
The child's daily contact with another human being

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.748
is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing,

00:04:36.748 --> 00:04:39.648
and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling,

00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:43.780
the walls or the bars of their cots.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.679
Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution,

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:49.812
I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries,

00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:52.604
from the Czech Republic to Sudan.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:55.588
Across all of these diverse lands and cultures,

00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:58.885
the institutions, and the child's journey through them,

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:01.478
is depressingly similar.

00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.588
Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors

00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:07.529
like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth,

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.340
or aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.171
are used to control the behavior of these children,

00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:16.372
whilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them

00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:19.260
from harming themselves or others.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.752
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities

00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:25.187
and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.

00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:29.530
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.193
For those without disabilities, at age three,

00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.741
they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven,

00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:38.694
to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender,

00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:41.239
they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings,

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.127
often without even a chance to say goodbye.

00:05:45.127 --> 00:05:47.905
There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.

00:05:47.905 --> 00:05:50.615
The older children bully the little ones. They learn to

00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:53.964
survive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:57.524
When they leave the institution, they find it really difficult

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.819
to cope and to integrate into society.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.068
In Moldova, young women raised in institutions

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.076
are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers,

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:12.232
and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions,

00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:16.591
young adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record,

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:19.447
14 percent were involved in prostitution,

00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:24.011
and 10 percent had taken their own lives.

00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:26.892
But why are there so many orphans in Europe

00:06:26.892 --> 00:06:30.763
when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?

00:06:30.763 --> 00:06:35.347
In fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents,

00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:37.336
and societies tend to blame these parents

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:40.099
for abandoning these children, but research shows that

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.220
most parents want their children, and that the primary drivers

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.539
behind institutionalization

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.736
are poverty, disability and ethnicity.

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:52.835
Many countries have not developed inclusive schools,

00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:55.539
and so even children with a very mild disability

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.115
are sent away to a residential special school,

00:06:58.115 --> 00:06:59.923
at age six or seven.

00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:04.057
The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.781
If the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit,

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:10.899
and gradually the relationship breaks down.

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.202
Behind each of the million children in institutions,

00:07:14.202 --> 00:07:17.956
there is usually a story of parents who are desperate

00:07:17.956 --> 00:07:23.066
and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova,

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.459
who only had enough money to feed her baby,

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.643
and so had to send her older son to the institution;

00:07:28.643 --> 00:07:31.683
or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:34.312
at home until her husband died,

00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:36.555
but then she had to go out to work full time,

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:38.702
and with no support, felt she had no option

00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.534
but to place a child with disabilities in an institution;

00:07:42.534 --> 00:07:45.688
or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents

00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:49.274
they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital;

00:07:49.274 --> 00:07:52.006
or the new parents, the young couple who have

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:56.512
just found out that their firstborn child has a disability,

00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:59.567
and instead of being provided with positive messages

00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:02.414
about their child's potential, are told by the doctors,

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:05.470
"Forget her, leave her in the institution,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.990
go home and make a healthy one."

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.522
This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.

00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:15.649
Every child has the right to a family, deserves

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:19.480
and needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.162
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving

00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:25.683
families early on, they recover their developmental delays,

00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:28.726
and go on to lead normal, happy lives.

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:32.287
It's also much cheaper to provide support to families

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:34.806
than it is to provide institutions.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.002
One study suggests that a family support service

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.910
costs 10 percent of an institutional placement,

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.174
whilst good quality foster care

00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:46.166
costs usually about 30 percent.

00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:49.214
If we spend less on these children but on the right services,

00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:53.166
we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:57.815
residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.

00:08:57.815 --> 00:09:02.352
Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus

00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:05.188
and transfer the resources from large institutions

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:09.148
that provide poor quality care to community-based services

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.873
that protect children from harm and allow them to develop

00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:15.700
to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.476
nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:23.037
in institutions, and more entering every day.

00:09:23.037 --> 00:09:25.348
Now, there are less than 10,000, and

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:28.796
family support services are provided across the country.

00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:32.582
In Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects

00:09:32.582 --> 00:09:35.574
of the global financial crisis, the numbers of children

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:38.358
in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent

00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:41.574
in the last five years, and the resources are being

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:46.227
redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.

00:09:46.227 --> 00:09:49.457
Many countries have developed national action plans for change.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.978
The European Commission and other major donors

00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:55.458
are finding ways to divert money from institutions

00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:58.454
towards family support, empowering communities

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:01.183
to look after their own children.

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:03.986
But there is still much to be done to end the systematic

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:06.354
institutionalization of children.

00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:09.423
Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:12.947
People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children,

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:15.907
and the better alternatives that exist.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.871
If we know people who are planning to support orphanages,

00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:22.913
we should convince them to support family services instead.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:26.175
Together, this is the one form of child abuse

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:29.039
that we could eradicate in our lifetime.

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.631
Thank you. (Applause)

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.631
(Applause)
