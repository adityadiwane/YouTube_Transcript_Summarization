00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
About a year ago,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I asked myself a question:

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
"Knowing what I know,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
why am I not a vegetarian?"

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
After all, I'm one of the green guys:

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I started a site called TreeHugger --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I care about this stuff.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
can increase my risk of dying by a third.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
animals we raise each year for meat

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
are raised in factory farm conditions

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
for our own cats, dogs and other pets.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Environmentally, meat, amazingly,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
causes more emissions

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
than all of transportation combined:

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And beef production uses 100 times the water

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
that most vegetables do.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
I also knew that I'm not alone.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
We as a society

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
are eating twice as much meat

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
as we did in the 50s.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
So what was once the special little side treat

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
now is the main, much more regular.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So really, any of these angles

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk --

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
tucking into a big old steak.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So why was I stalling?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I realized that what I was being pitched

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
was a binary solution.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
It was either

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Imagine your last hamburger.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Laughter)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So my common sense,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
my good intentions,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
were in conflict with my taste buds.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And I'd commit to doing it later,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and not surprisingly, later never came.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Sound familiar?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So I wondered,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
might there be a third solution?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
It's called weekday veg.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The name says it all:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
On the weekend, your choice.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Simple.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
If you want to take it to the next level,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
remember, the major culprits

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
in terms of environmental damage and health

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
are red and processed meats.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So you want to swap those out

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
with some good, sustainably harvested fish.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
It's structured,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
so it ends up being simple to remember,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and it's okay to break it here and there.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
After all, cutting five days a week

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
The program has been great, weekday veg.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
My footprint's smaller,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
I'm lessening pollution,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I feel better about the animals,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I'm even saving money.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Best of all, I'm healthier,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I know that I'm going to live longer,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and I've even lost a little weight.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
So, please ask yourselves,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
for your health,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
for your pocketbook,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
for the environment, for the animals:

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
After all, if all of us

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
ate half as much meat,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
it would be like half of us

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
were vegetarians.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Thank you.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
(Applause)
