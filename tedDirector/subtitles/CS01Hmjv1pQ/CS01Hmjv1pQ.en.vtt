00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is actually quite simple.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
The gray boxes that you see,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
these are real-time control systems.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Now if we manage to compromise these systems

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that control drive speeds and valves,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
we can actually cause a lot of problems

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
with the centrifuge.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
they are a completely different technology.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
But if we manage

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to place a good Windows virus

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
on a notebook

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that is used by a maintenance engineer

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
to configure this gray box,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
then we are in business.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So we start with a Windows dropper.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
The payload goes onto the gray box,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
damages the centrifuge,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
mission accomplished.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
That's easy, huh?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I want to tell you how we found that out.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The only thing that was known

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And it seemed to want to do something

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So that got our attention,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and we started a lab project

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
where we infected our environment with Stuxnet

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and checked this thing out.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And then some very funny things happened.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that didn't like our cheese --

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
sniffed, but didn't want to eat.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Didn't make sense to me.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I realized, well, this is a directed attack.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
It's completely directed.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
The dropper is prowling actively

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
on the gray box

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
if a specific configuration is found,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
is actually running on that target.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So that really got my attention,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and we started to work on this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
nearly around the clock,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It could be, let's say for example,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
a U.S. power plant,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
or a chemical plant in Germany.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So we better find out what the target is soon."

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
So we extracted and decompiled

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the attack code,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
a smaller one and a bigger one.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
by people who obviously had all insider information.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
They knew all the bits and bites

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that they had to attack.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So they know everything.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
is complex and high-tech,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
let me tell you this:

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
the payload is rocket science.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
It's way above everything

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that we have ever seen before.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
We are talking about --

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
around about 15,000 lines of code.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And I want to tell you how we were able

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
to make sense out of this code.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
because we know what they do.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And then we were looking for timers and data structures

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and trying to relate them to the real world --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to potential real world targets.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So we do need target theories

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that we can prove or disprove.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
In order to get target theories,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
we remember

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
it must be a high-value target

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and it is most likely located in Iran,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.260
because that's where most of the infections had been reported.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It basically boils down

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to the Bushehr nuclear power plant

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So I told my assistant,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And I phoned them up and picked their brain

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
in an effort to match their expertise

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
with what we found in code and data.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And that worked pretty well.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So we were able to associate

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the small digital warhead

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
with the rotor control.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
that black object that you see.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
you are actually able to crack the rotor

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
What we also saw

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
is that the goal of the attack

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
was really to do it slowly and creepy --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
obviously in an effort

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to drive maintenance engineers crazy,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
by looking very closely

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
at data and data structures.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So for example, the number 164

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
really stands out in that code;

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
you can't overlook it.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I started to research scientific literature

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
on how these centrifuges

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
are actually built in Natanz

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and found they are structured

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
in what is called a cascade,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So that made sense, that was a match.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And it even got better.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
These centrifuges in Iran

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.260
are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And guess what we found in the attack code?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
An almost identical structure.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
So again, that was a real good match.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
These results have been obtained

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
over several weeks of really hard labor.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And we often went into just a dead end

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and had to recover.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Anyway, so we figured out

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
that both digital warheads

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
were actually aiming at one and the same target,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
but from different angles.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
The small warhead is taking one cascade,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and the big warhead

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is talking to six cascades

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and manipulating valves.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So in all, we are very confident

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that we have actually determined what the target is.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So we don't have to worry

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that other targets

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
might be hit by Stuxnet.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
really knocked my socks off.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Down there is the gray box,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and on the top you see the centrifuges.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Now what this thing does

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
is it intercepts the input values from sensors --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
so for example, from pressure sensors

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and vibration sensors --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and it provides legitimate program code,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
which is still running during the attack,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
with fake input data.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
where during the heist,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
That's cool, huh?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
The idea here is obviously

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
not only to fool the operators in the control room.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
The idea

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
is to circumvent a digital safety system.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
We need digital safety systems

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
where a human operator could not act quick enough.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So for example, in a power plant,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
you must open relief valves within a millisecond.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So this is where we need digital safety systems.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And when they are compromised,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
then real bad things can happen.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Your plant can blow up.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
That's scary.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
But it gets worse.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Think about this:

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
this attack is generic.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
with centrifuges,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
with uranium enrichment.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So it would work as well, for example,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
in a power plant

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
or in an automobile factory.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
It is generic.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And you don't have -- as an attacker --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
you don't have to deliver this payload

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
by a USB stick,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Just spread it as wide as possible.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And if you do that,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
what you end up with

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
That's the consequence

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that we have to face.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
So unfortunately,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
the biggest number of targets for such attacks

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
are not in the Middle East.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So all of the green areas,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
these are your target-rich environments.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
We have to face the consequences,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and we better start to prepare right now.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Thanks.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:49.260
(Applause)

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
that people assume that Mossad

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
is the main entity behind this.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Is that your opinion?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Yeah. Okay.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
but that the leading force is not Israel.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
So the leading force behind that

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
is the cyber superpower.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
There is only one,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and that's the United States --

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
fortunately, fortunately.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Because otherwise,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
our problems would even be bigger.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260
CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
(Applause)
