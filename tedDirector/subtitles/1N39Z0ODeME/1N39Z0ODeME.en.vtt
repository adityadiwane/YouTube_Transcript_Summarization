00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:15.021
Cancer affects all of us --

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.412
especially the ones that come
back over and over again,

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.432
the highly invasive
and drug-resistant ones,

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:23.835
the ones that defy medical treatment,

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.375
even when we throw our best drugs at them.

00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:30.167
Engineering at the molecular level,

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.839
working at the smallest of scales,

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:35.386
can provide exciting new ways

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.338
to fight the most aggressive
forms of cancer.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.737
Cancer is a very clever disease.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:43.923
There are some forms of cancer,

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:48.682
which, fortunately, we've learned
how to address relatively well

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:52.098
with known and established
drugs and surgery.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:54.604
But there are some forms of cancer

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.860
that don't respond to these approaches,

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.512
and the tumor survives or comes back,

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:01.665
even after an onslaught of drugs.

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:06.047
We can think of these
very aggressive forms of cancer

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:08.937
as kind of supervillains in a comic book.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:12.160
They're clever, they're adaptable,

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:14.993
and they're very good at staying alive.

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:18.406
And, like most supervillains these days,

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:22.906
their superpowers come
from a genetic mutation.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.682
The genes that are modified
inside these tumor cells

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:32.973
can enable and encode for new
and unimagined modes of survival,

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:35.472
allowing the cancer cell to live through

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.861
even our best chemotherapy treatments.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.296
One example is a trick
in which a gene allows a cell,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.804
even as the drug approaches the cell,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.039
to push the drug out,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.023
before the drug can have any effect.

00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:55.733
Imagine -- the cell effectively
spits out the drug.

00:01:56.393 --> 00:01:59.323
This is just one example
of the many genetic tricks

00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:01.947
in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.131
All due to mutant genes.

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:09.438
So, we have a supervillain
with incredible superpowers.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.584
And we need a new and powerful
mode of attack.

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:16.788
Actually, we can turn off a gene.

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:20.669
The key is a set of molecules
known as siRNA.

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:24.746
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:28.334
that guide a cell to block a certain gene.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.557
Each siRNA molecule
can turn off a specific gene

00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:34.151
inside the cell.

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:37.313
For many years since its discovery,

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:39.287
scientists have been very excited

00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:42.668
about how we can apply
these gene blockers in medicine.

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:44.934
But, there is a problem.

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.418
siRNA works well inside the cell.

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.848
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:53.372
that reside in our bloodstream
or our tissues,

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:55.251
it degrades within seconds.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.085
It has to be packaged, protected
through its journey through the body

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.179
on its way to the final target
inside the cancer cell.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.057
So, here's our strategy.

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:10.271
First, we'll dose the cancer cell
with siRNA, the gene blocker,

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:11.891
and silence those survival genes,

00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.003
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.179
But how do we carry that out?

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:18.544
Using molecular engineering,

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:22.893
we can actually design a superweapon

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.899
that can travel through the bloodstream.

00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:28.919
It has to be tiny enough
to get through the bloodstream,

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:31.814
it's got to be small enough
to penetrate the tumor tissue,

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:36.513
and it's got to be tiny enough
to be taken up inside the cancer cell.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.651
To do this job well,

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:43.480
it has to be about one one-hundredth
the size of a human hair.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.605
Let's take a closer look
at how we can build this nanoparticle.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.543
First, let's start
with the nanoparticle core.

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:55.367
It's a tiny capsule that contains
the chemotherapy drug.

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.566
This is the poison that will
actually end the tumor cell's life.

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.937
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:06.794
nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:08.452
This is our gene blocker.

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:12.682
Because siRNA is strongly
negatively charged,

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:14.263
we can protect it

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:19.012
with a nice, protective layer
of positively charged polymer.

00:04:19.503 --> 00:04:22.760
The two oppositely charged
molecules stick together

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.220
through charge attraction,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.378
and that provides us
with a protective layer

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:29.453
that prevents the siRNA
from degrading in the bloodstream.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:31.406
We're almost done.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.890
(Laughter)

00:04:32.914 --> 00:04:36.992
But there is one more big obstacle
we have to think about.

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:39.408
In fact, it may be the biggest
obstacle of all.

00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:41.406
How do we deploy this superweapon?

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.984
I mean, every good weapon
needs to be targeted,

00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:48.073
we have to target this superweapon
to the supervillain cells

00:04:48.097 --> 00:04:50.047
that reside in the tumor.

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.344
But our bodies have a natural
immune-defense system:

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.867
cells that reside in the bloodstream

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:58.236
and pick out things that don't belong,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.559
so that it can destroy or eliminate them.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:05.019
And guess what? Our nanoparticle
is considered a foreign object.

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:09.817
We have to sneak our nanoparticle
past the tumor defense system.

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:16.095
We have to get it past this mechanism
of getting rid of the foreign object

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:17.539
by disguising it.

00:05:17.563 --> 00:05:21.908
So we add one more
negatively charged layer

00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:23.256
around this nanoparticle,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.718
which serves two purposes.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.108
First, this outer layer is one
of the naturally charged,

00:05:29.132 --> 00:05:32.845
highly hydrated polysaccharides
that resides in our body.

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:38.289
It creates a cloud of water molecules
around the nanoparticle

00:05:38.313 --> 00:05:41.384
that gives us an invisibility
cloaking effect.

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:44.974
This invisibility cloak allows
the nanoparticle

00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:46.604
to travel through the bloodstream

00:05:46.628 --> 00:05:49.393
long and far enough to reach the tumor,

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:51.556
without getting eliminated by the body.

00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:56.513
Second, this layer contains molecules

00:05:56.537 --> 00:05:59.736
which bind specifically to our tumor cell.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.710
Once bound, the cancer cell
takes up the nanoparticle,

00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:09.108
and now we have our nanoparticle
inside the cancer cell

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:10.805
and ready to deploy.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.541
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:19.747
(Applause)

00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:23.283
The siRNA is deployed first.

00:06:24.287 --> 00:06:25.913
It acts for hours,

00:06:25.937 --> 00:06:30.505
giving enough time to silence
and block those survival genes.

00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:35.336
We have now disabled
those genetic superpowers.

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:38.954
What remains is a cancer cell
with no special defenses.

00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:41.880
Then, the chemotherapy drug
comes out of the core

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:45.488
and destroys the tumor cell
cleanly and efficiently.

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:48.565
With sufficient gene blockers,

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.799
we can address many
different kinds of mutations,

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:54.184
allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.399
without leaving behind any bad guys.

00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.527
So, how does our strategy work?

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:05.504
We've tested these nanostructure
particles in animals

00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:09.111
using a highly aggressive form
of triple-negative breast cancer.

00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:11.690
This triple-negative breast cancer
exhibits the gene

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:15.189
that spits out cancer drug
as soon as it is delivered.

00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:20.913
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call
it "dox" -- is the cancer drug

00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:23.746
that is the first line of treatment
for breast cancer.

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:29.948
So, we first treated our animals
with a dox core, dox only.

00:07:30.661 --> 00:07:32.868
The tumor slowed their rate of growth,

00:07:32.892 --> 00:07:34.332
but they still grew rapidly,

00:07:34.356 --> 00:07:36.684
doubling in size
over a period of two weeks.

00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:40.395
Then, we tried
our combination superweapon.

00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:45.827
A nanolayer particle with siRNA
against the chemo pump,

00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:48.846
plus, we have the dox in the core.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.185
And look -- we found that not only
did the tumors stop growing,

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:55.725
they actually decreased in size

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:58.164
and were eliminated in some cases.

00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:01.444
The tumors were actually regressing.

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:08.841
(Applause)

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.628
What's great about this approach
is that it can be personalized.

00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:16.488
We can add many different layers of siRNA

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:20.070
to address different mutations
and tumor defense mechanisms.

00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:23.379
And we can put different drugs
into the nanoparticle core.

00:08:23.946 --> 00:08:27.153
As doctors learn how to test patients

00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:30.951
and understand certain
tumor genetic types,

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:34.717
they can help us determine which patients
can benefit from this strategy

00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:37.019
and which gene blockers we can use.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.313
Ovarian cancer strikes
a special chord with me.

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:43.310
It is a very aggressive cancer,

00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:46.219
in part because it's discovered
at very late stages,

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:47.690
when it's highly advanced

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:49.990
and there are a number
of genetic mutations.

00:08:50.566 --> 00:08:53.555
After the first round of chemotherapy,

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:57.969
this cancer comes back
for 75 percent of patients.

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:01.159
And it usually comes back
in a drug-resistant form.

00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:03.909
High-grade ovarian cancer

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:06.100
is one of the biggest
supervillains out there.

00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:08.036
And we're now directing our superweapon

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.376
toward its defeat.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.637
As a researcher,

00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.516
I usually don't get to work with patients.

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:18.581
But I recently met a mother

00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:23.502
who is an ovarian cancer survivor,
Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.

00:09:24.257 --> 00:09:28.361
I was deeply inspired
by the optimism and strength

00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.478
that both mother and daughter displayed

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:34.187
and by their story of courage and support.

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:38.522
At this event, we spoke
about the different technologies

00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:39.925
directed at cancer.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:41.664
And Mimi was in tears

00:09:41.688 --> 00:09:44.515
as she explained how learning
about these efforts

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:46.749
gives her hope for future generations,

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:48.658
including her own daughter.

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:50.863
This really touched me.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:54.703
It's not just about building
really elegant science.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.239
It's about changing people's lives.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.541
It's about understanding
the power of engineering

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:03.446
on the scale of molecules.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.553
I know that as students like Paige
move forward in their careers,

00:10:07.577 --> 00:10:09.017
they'll open new possibilities

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:12.431
in addressing some of the big
health problems in the world --

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:17.454
including ovarian cancer, neurological
disorders, infectious disease --

00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:22.045
just as chemical engineering has
found a way to open doors for me,

00:10:22.437 --> 00:10:25.071
and has provided a way of engineering

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:28.627
on the tiniest scale,
that of molecules,

00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:31.214
to heal on the human scale.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:32.955
Thank you.

00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:41.539
(Applause)
