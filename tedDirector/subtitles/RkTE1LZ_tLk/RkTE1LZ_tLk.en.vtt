00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.931
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.243
It has generated considerable insight in physics,

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.343
in biology and economics,

00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:26.160
but not that much in the humanities and in history.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.443
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible,

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:31.089
that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.608
that you cannot measure history.

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:35.135
But I don't think that's right.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.177
I want to show you a couple of examples why.

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:40.135
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.864
that two kings separated by centuries

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:44.631
will speak a very different language.

00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:46.935
That's a powerful historical force.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:48.708
So the king of England, Alfred the Great,

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.348
will use a vocabulary and grammar

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:54.048
that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:55.714
(Laughter)

00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:57.885
Now it's just the way it is.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.177
Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force.

00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:02.464
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.

00:01:02.464 --> 00:01:06.121
So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.385
So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.312
"Today I walk. Yesterday I walked."

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:12.656
But some verbs are irregular.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.052
"Yesterday I thought."

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:15.718
Now what's interesting about that

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:19.548
is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:22.283
Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular.

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:26.305
So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:28.224
through 12 centuries of English language,

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:31.135
and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:33.677
that captures this complex historical change,

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:37.337
namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another,

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:40.002
it regularizes 10 times slower.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.937
That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.591
Now in some cases math can even help explain,

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:50.470
or propose explanations for, historical forces.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.302
So here Steve Pinker and I

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:56.154
were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.

00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:58.649
There's actually a well-known regularity to them

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.071
where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.023
is 10 times smaller.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.367
So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War,

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:10.187
but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier --

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.164
like World War I.

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:15.087
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:17.087
What's the origin of this?

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.352
So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis,

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:23.593
propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this,

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:25.283
which lies in our brains.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.302
This is a very well-known feature

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.277
in which we perceive quantities in relative ways --

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:33.993
quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:39.302
For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.

00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:42.746
It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.573
But it doesn't sound so much,

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:47.593
it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference

00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:50.545
if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:54.158
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities,

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:55.925
as the war drags on,

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:59.010
the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.693
will increase not linearly --

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:02.581
like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 --

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:06.856
but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:09.941
And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:15.439
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.428
with a long-term historical pattern

00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:21.285
that unfolds over centuries and across continents.

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:25.302
So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them,

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:27.991
but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.383
The reason for that is that the historical record

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:32.843
is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.

00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:35.453
So there's about 130 million books

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:37.764
that have been written since the dawn of time.

00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:40.218
Companies like Google have digitized many of them --

00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:41.802
above 20 million actually.

00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:45.380
And when the stuff of history is available in digital form,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.760
it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.135
to very quickly and very conveniently

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.860
review trends in our history and our culture.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.581
So I think in the next decade,

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:58.331
the sciences and the humanities will come closer together

00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.660
to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.781
And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:08.927
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history,

00:04:08.927 --> 00:04:10.677
sometimes to explain them,

00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:13.983
and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:15.474
Thank you very much.

00:04:15.474 --> 00:04:19.152
