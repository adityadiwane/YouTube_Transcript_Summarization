00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
This is 26th, that's 27th."

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Streets have names; blocks are just the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
unnamed spaces in between streets."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
you turn to a person next to you and say,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Blocks have names.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
All of these blocks have names,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
There's Block 17, house number one."

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The second house ever built is house number two.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So, I love that sometimes we need to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
go to the opposite side of the world

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
So, for example, there are doctors in China

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
(Applause)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
In most music, we think of the "one"

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
But in West African music, the "one"

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is thought of as the end of the phrase,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
like the period at the end of a sentence.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
two, three, four, one.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And this map is also accurate.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Laughter)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
the opposite is also true.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
that the opposite may also be true.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
