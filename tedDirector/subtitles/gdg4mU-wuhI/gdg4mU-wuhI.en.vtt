00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Because I usually take the role

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
of trying to explain to people

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
how wonderful the new technologies

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
that are coming along are going to be,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and I thought that, since I was among friends here,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
I would tell you what I really think

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and try to look back and try to understand

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
what is really going on here

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.260
with these amazing jumps in technology

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
So I'm going to start out

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
by showing just one very boring technology slide.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
This is just a random slide

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that I picked out of my file.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
but the general form of it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
about the power of RISC microprocessors

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
versus the power of local area networks.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And the interesting thing about it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
is that this slide,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
like so many technology slides that we're used to,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
is a sort of a straight line

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
on a semi-log curve.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
In other words, every step here

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
represents an order of magnitude

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
in performance scale.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And this is a new thing

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
that we talk about technology

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
on semi-log curves.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Something really weird is going on here.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
So, if you could bring up the lights.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
If you could bring up the lights higher,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Now why do we draw technology curves

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
in semi-log curves?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
where, let's say, this is years,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
this is time of some sort,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and this is whatever measure of the technology

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
that I'm trying to graph,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
the graphs look sort of silly.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
They sort of go like this.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And they don't tell us much.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Now if I graph, for instance,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
some other technology, say transportation technology,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
on a semi-log curve,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But when something like this happens,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
things are qualitatively changing.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So if transportation technology

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
then the day after tomorrow,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I would be able to get in a taxi cab

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
It's not moving like that.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And there's nothing precedented

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in the history of technology development

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
of this kind of self-feeding growth

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Now the question that I'd like to ask is,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
if you look at these exponential curves,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
they don't go on forever.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Things just can't possibly keep changing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
as fast as they are.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
One of two things is going to happen.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
until something totally different comes along,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
or maybe it's going to do this.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
That's about all it can do.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Now I'm an optimist,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
is a transition.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
We're sort of on this line

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
in a transition from the way the world used to be

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to some new way that the world is.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is what's this new way that the world is?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Because the transition seems very, very confusing

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
when we're right in the middle of it.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Now when I was a kid growing up,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the future was kind of the year 2000,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Now here's a conference

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in which people talk about the future,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
It's about as far as we go out.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
one year per year

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
for my whole lifetime.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Now I think that the reason

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
is because we all feel

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that something's happening there.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to think out 30, 50 years

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
because everything's going to be so different

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
just doesn't make any sense at all.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
So what I would like to talk about

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
is what that could be,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
what that transition could be that we're going through.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Now in order to do that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
that really has nothing to do

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
with technology and computers.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Because I think the only way to understand this

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
is to really step back

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and take a long time scale look at things.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is the time scale of life on Earth.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So I think this picture makes sense

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
if you look at it a few billion years at a time.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
So if you go back

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
about two and a half billion years,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And if you look at the way

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that the chemicals got organized,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
about how it started with RNA,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
which is that, at that time,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
there were little drops of oil floating around

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And some of those drops of oil

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
had a particular combination of chemicals in them

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and grow the drops of oil.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And those that were like that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
started to split and divide.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
those little drops of oil.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
because every one of them

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
was a little random recipe of chemicals.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And every time it divided,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
they got sort of unequal division

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
of the chemicals within them.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And so every drop was a little bit different.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
In fact, the drops that were different in a way

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
that caused them to be better

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
at incorporating chemicals around them,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So those tended to live longer,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
get expressed more.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Now that's sort of just a very simple

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
chemical form of life,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
but when things got interesting

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
was when these drops

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
learned a trick about abstraction.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
these little drops learned to write down information.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
They learned to record the information

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that was the recipe of the cell

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
onto a particular kind of chemical

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
called DNA.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
So in other words, they worked out,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
a form of writing that let them write down what they were,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
so that that way of writing it down could get copied.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
The amazing thing is that that way of writing

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
seems to have stayed steady

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
In fact the recipe for us, our genes,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
In fact, every living creature is written

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
In fact, one of the things that I did

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
just for amusement purposes

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
is we can now write things in this code.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.260
which I try not to let the security people see at airports.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
(Laughter)

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But this has in it --

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
what I did is I took this code --

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I have plenty for everyone in the room,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and, in fact, everyone in the world,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and it's right here.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Laughter)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
If I had really been a egotist,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.260
(Laughter)

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
So what was the next step?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And that caused these cells --

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that kept them happy for another billion years.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
But then there was another really interesting step

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
where things became completely different,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
so that they began to get communities of cells.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I don't know if you know this,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Now that's why, for instance,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
antibiotic resistance has evolved.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
with other bacteria,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
because bacteria communicate.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Now what this communication allowed

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
was communities to form

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
they were synergistic.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
So they survived

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
or they failed together,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
which means that if a community was very successful,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
all the individuals in that community

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
were repeated more

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and they were favored by evolution.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Now the transition point happened

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
when these communities got so close

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
that, in fact, they got together

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
together on one string of DNA.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And so the next stage that's interesting in life

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
took about another billion years.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And at that stage,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
we have multi-cellular communities,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
communities of lots of different types of cells,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
working together as a single organism.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
We have lots of cells

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that are not out for themselves anymore.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Your skin cell is really useless

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
without a heart cell, muscle cell,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
a brain cell and so on.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So these communities began to evolve

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
was no longer a cell,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
but a community which we call an organism.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Now the next step that happened

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
is within these communities.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
These communities of cells,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
again, began to abstract information.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And they began building very special structures

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
that did nothing but process information within the community.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And those are the neural structures.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
So neurons are the information processing apparatus

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
that those communities of cells built up.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and special structures

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
that were responsible for recording,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
understanding, learning information.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And that was the brains and the nervous system

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
of those communities.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Because at that point,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
an individual --

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
learning could happen

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
within the time span of a single organism,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
instead of over this evolutionary time span.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
So an organism could, for instance,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.260
whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
that would have had to be learned evolutionarily

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
So that nervous system,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
the fact that they built these special information structures,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
It could happen in learning time scales.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
But then what happened

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
was the individuals worked out,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
of course, tricks of communicating.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And for example,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Here I have a very complicated, messy,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
confused idea in my head.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
that bears some analogy to it.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
But we're taking something very complicated,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and producing something very complicated in your brain.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So this allows us now

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
to begin to start functioning

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
as a single organism.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And so, in fact, what we've done

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
is we, humanity,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
have started abstracting out.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
We're going through the same levels

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
abstracting out our methods of recording,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
presenting, processing information.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
So for example, the invention of language

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
was a tiny step in that direction.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Telephony, computers,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
are all our specialized mechanisms

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
that we've now built within our society

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
for handling that information.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
And it all connects us together

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
into something

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
that is much bigger

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and much faster

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and able to evolve

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
than what we were before.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So now, evolution can take place

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
on a scale of microseconds.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
where he sort of did a little bit of evolution

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
on the Convolution program right before your eyes.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
So the first steps of the story that I told you about

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
took a billion years a piece.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
And the next steps,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
like nervous systems and brains,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
took a few hundred million years.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Then the next steps, like language and so on,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
took less than a million years.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And these next steps, like electronics,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
seem to be taking only a few decades.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
The process is feeding on itself

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
when something reinforces its rate of change.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
The more it changes, the faster it changes.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Now I design computers for a living,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and I know that the mechanisms

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
that I use to design computers

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
would be impossible

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
without recent advances in computers.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
So right now, what I do

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
is I design objects at such complexity

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
There are billions of them.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Instead, what I do

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and what the designers at Thinking Machines do

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
is we think at some level of abstraction

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and then we hand it to the machine

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
much farther and faster than we could ever do.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
that we don't quite even understand.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
One method that's particularly interesting

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
that I've been using a lot lately

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
is evolution itself.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So what we do

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
is we put inside the machine

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
a process of evolution

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
that takes place on the microsecond time scale.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
So for example,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
in the most extreme cases,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
we can actually evolve a program

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.260
by starting out with random sequences of instructions.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Say, "Computer, would you please make

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
a hundred million random sequences of instructions.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
run all of those programs,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
So in other words, I define what I wanted.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Let's say I want to sort numbers,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
as a simple example I've done it with.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
So of course, random sequences of instructions

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
are very unlikely to sort numbers,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
so none of them will really do it.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
But one of them, by luck,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
may put two numbers in the right order.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And I say, "Computer,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
would you please now take the 10 percent

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
of those random sequences that did the best job.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Save those. Kill off the rest.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
And now let's reproduce

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
the ones that sorted numbers the best.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
analogous to sex."

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
Take two programs and they produce children

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
by exchanging their subroutines,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
So I've got now a new generation of programs

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that are produced by combinations

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
of the programs that did a little bit better job.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Say, "Please repeat that process."

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
Score them again.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Introduce some mutations perhaps.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
And try that again and do that for another generation.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
So I can do the equivalent

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
of millions of years of evolution on that

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
within the computer in a few minutes,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
At the end of that, I end up with programs

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
than programs I could have ever written by hand.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Now if I look at those programs,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I can't tell you how they work.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
They're obscure, weird programs.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
But they do the job.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
because they come from a line

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.260
(Laughter)

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I was riding in a 747

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
with Marvin Minsky once,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.260
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.260
working together to make you a safe flight.'

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Doesn't that make you feel confident?"

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
(Laughter)

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
when it gets complicated.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
So we're beginning to depend on computers

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.260
to do a process that's very different than engineering.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
than normal engineering lets us produce.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
We're now using those programs

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
to make much faster computers

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
So it's feeding back on itself.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
The thing is becoming faster

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
and that's why I think it seems so confusing.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
We're taking off.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And what we are is we're at a point in time

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
which is analogous to when single-celled organisms

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
were turning into multi-celled organisms.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
So we're the amoebas

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
We're right at that point of transition.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
I think it's very haughty of us

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
to think that we're the end product of evolution.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
And I think all of us here

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
are a part of producing

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
whatever that next thing is.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
So lunch is coming along,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
and I think I will stop at that point,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
before I get selected out.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
(Applause)
