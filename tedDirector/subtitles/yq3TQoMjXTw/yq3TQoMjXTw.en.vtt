00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.841
Okay, this morning I'm speaking

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.030
on the question of corruption.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.190
And corruption is defined

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.926
as the abuse of a position of trust

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.566
for the benefit of yourself -- or, in the case of our context,

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.189
your friends, your family or your financiers.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:39.712
Okay? Friends, family and financiers.

00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:43.727
But we need to understand what we understand about corruption,

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:46.525
and we need to understand that

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.874
we have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:51.431
We have to have the courage to admit that

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.876
to start changing how we deal with it.

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.799
The first thing is that the big myth, number one,

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.170
is that in fact it's not really a crime.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.960
When we get together with friends and family

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.839
and we discuss crime in our country,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.432
crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.962
nobody's speaking about corruption.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.512
That's the honest truth.

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:12.549
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.559
he isn't speaking about corruption.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.875
And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.750
is speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.365
The point I'm making is that it is a crime.

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:28.215
It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.983
Public and private corruption is a reality.

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:32.714
As somebody who comes from the private sector,

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:35.110
I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.889
in the private sector that has nothing to do with government.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.731
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.199
it all takes place in the private sector.

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:46.800
Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.935
which the private sector also participates in.

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.231
The second important myth to understand --

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.965
because we have to destroy these myths,

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.425
dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:58.371
the second important myth to understand

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.863
is the one that says

00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:04.132
that in fact corruption is only a small problem --

00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:06.462
if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:10.156
that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:14.047
it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,

00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:17.831
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.

00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:20.191
And I want to demonstrate that that, too,

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:22.128
is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:24.549
It's a piece of public mischief.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.143
And I want to speak a little bit,

00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:29.391
take us back about 30 years.

00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.385
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.583
a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:39.629
and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.122
and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:46.157
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:49.845
And it's ironic, because

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:51.883
we're standing today in the Central Bank.

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:54.079
You see, history's rich in irony.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.901
We're standing today in the Central Bank,

00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:59.279
and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.604
Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.

00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:05.352
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.391
the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.079
and there's a lot of connection with us today,

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.929
so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.829
(Applause)

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.071
The first thing I want to talk about is that

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:22.767
when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:24.854
we embarked, the government of the day embarked

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:26.964
on a series of government-to-government arrangements

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:28.998
to have rapidly develop the country.

00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:31.264
And some of the largest projects in the country

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:34.462
were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:36.278
with some of the leading countries in the world,

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:38.986
the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:42.054
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:43.738
this building was part of that series of complexes,

00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:47.846
what they called the Twin Towers.

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.806
It became so outrageous, the whole situation,

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.686
that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.689
and it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported --

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.438
the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago,

00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:04.374
and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.

00:04:04.374 --> 00:04:06.282
The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.479
to give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.776
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.156
It went right into my heart.

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:17.913
And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.

00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:20.390
Are we getting a, yeah?—

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.389
That's what he told us.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.529
He told us that, in fact,

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.451
two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars

00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:31.835
that we spent, the taxpayers' money,

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:33.919
was wasted or stolen.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.962
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:40.071
As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.766
That's for little children. We are big people,

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.553
and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.

00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:46.698
Okay? This is the size of the problem.

00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:49.710
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.152
That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:55.211
So what has changed?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.898
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:59.457
to an international audience, but I have to.

00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:02.970
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.868
We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:10.514
a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,

00:05:10.514 --> 00:05:11.869
a suspicious piece of law

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:14.012
was passed at a suspicious time

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:15.910
to free some suspects. (Laughter)

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.643
And it was called, those people are called

00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:24.217
the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:24.217 --> 00:05:27.094
I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.921
They are the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:31.814
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order,

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.870
and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.969
Our highest institution in our country was perverted.

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.942
We are dealing with perverts here

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:42.664
of an economic and financial nature.

00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:44.513
Do you get how serious this problem is?

00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:46.623
There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room

00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:49.333
took part in the protest in different forms.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.152
Most importantly, the American embassy complained,

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.639
so Parliament was swiftly reconvened,

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.544
and the law was reversed, it was repealed.

00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:58.491
That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.608
But the point is

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:05.303
that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:07.789
because what really happened is that,

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.863
because of the suspicious passage of that law,

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:13.184
the law was actually passed into effect

00:06:13.184 --> 00:06:16.442
on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.002
our jubilee of independence.

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.024
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:23.435
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:25.122
because we all understood it,

00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.880
and for the first time that I could remember,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.430
there were mass protests against this corruption.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.621
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:34.484
Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like

00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:37.853
you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:41.301
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.277
fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:49.888
So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.

00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:51.784
But what were they accused of?

00:06:51.784 --> 00:06:52.887
What was it that they were accused of?

00:06:52.887 --> 00:06:56.166
I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.748
We were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:01.350
an airport that had grown outdated.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.140
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.707
Trinidad and Tobago dollars,

00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:10.870
and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.057
and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.

00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:18.147
And to get an idea of what it consisted of,

00:07:18.147 --> 00:07:21.027
and to put it in context in relationship to this whole

00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.460
second myth about it being no big thing,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.231
we can look at this second slide here.

00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:29.924
And what we have here -- I am not saying so,

00:07:29.924 --> 00:07:34.731
this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.

00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.205
And he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,

00:07:39.205 --> 00:07:41.397
one billion dollars has been traced

00:07:41.397 --> 00:07:43.160
to offshore bank accounts.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.323
One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money

00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:48.721
has been located in offshore bank accounts.

00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:50.834
Being the kind of suspicious person I am,

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:53.551
I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,

00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:56.047
I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:57.861
I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw

00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.605
in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.

00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:05.797
It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.

00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:07.730
And I was walking around with the protesters

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.023
looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.

00:08:12.023 --> 00:08:14.343
And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:16.767
a kind of battered-looking blonde lady,

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:19.590
and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.582
and it was made with a marker.

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:24.103
And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:28.510
It said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.492
If you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:35.623
So listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.

00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:37.780
My brain started thinking.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.671
Well, what if --

00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:43.877
because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:45.555
What if -- (Laughter)

00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:48.079
But to make it in these wrongs,

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:49.704
you have to read a lot of spy novels

00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:52.271
and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)

00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:56.838
But what if this wasn't the first time?

00:08:56.838 --> 00:08:59.425
What if this is just the first time

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:01.760
that the so-and-sos had been caught?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.886
What if it had happened before? How would I find out?

00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:09.376
Now, the previous two examples I gave

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:13.432
were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?

00:09:13.432 --> 00:09:15.463
And I have the privilege at this time

00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:18.841
to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.438
We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders

00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:25.664
in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:27.824
about how public money is transacted.

00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:30.029
So those of you interested in finding out more about it,

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:34.309
or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:36.568
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,

00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:39.344
because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:41.680
for over three and a half years

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.169
is for transparency and accountability

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.268
around the bailout of CL Financial.

00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:52.269
CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:55.192
And without getting into all of the details,

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:58.208
it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully —

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.035
it's said to have collapsed in January of '09,

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:04.713
which is just coming up to nearly four years.

00:10:04.713 --> 00:10:07.525
In an unprecedented fit of generosity --

00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:10.008
and you have to be very suspicious about these people --

00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:12.639
in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully —

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:16.523
unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day

00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:20.178
signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:22.500
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.682
that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:27.593
Let's understand, because we lack context.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.598
People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.

00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:35.087
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.

00:10:35.087 --> 00:10:39.831
It's not just like anywhere. (Applause)

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:44.985
It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.

00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:47.816
Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?

00:10:47.816 --> 00:10:49.146
I'm serious now.

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:52.129
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:54.080
They've had bailouts in London.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.217
They've had bailouts in Europe.

00:10:56.217 --> 00:10:58.887
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major

00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:01.452
commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.693
It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --

00:11:03.693 --> 00:11:06.083
how they've treated it, and they've treated it

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.954
very well compared to us.

00:11:07.954 --> 00:11:09.886
Nowhere on the planet

00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.592
have all the creditors been bailed out

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:14.884
in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.

00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:18.466
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?

00:11:18.466 --> 00:11:21.271
Is our government that generous? And maybe they are.

00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.287
Let's look at it. Let's look into it.

00:11:23.287 --> 00:11:26.055
So I started digging and writing and so and so on,

00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.867
and that work can be found, my personal work

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.247
can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.

00:11:31.247 --> 00:11:34.119
It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:36.643
Not as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.

00:11:36.643 --> 00:11:38.901
(Laughter)

00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:43.390
But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.847
that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience

00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:48.933
that took place in August,

00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:51.831
when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,

00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:56.495
going into September, forced me to check myself

00:11:56.495 --> 00:11:58.554
and recalculate my bearings,

00:11:58.554 --> 00:12:00.776
and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written

00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:03.045
and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:05.049
to see what was really what.

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:09.159
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:10.983
Okay? We want to try to recalculate.

00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:13.407
And I made a Freedom of Information application

00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:17.321
in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.

00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.379
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.054
This is the other context.

00:12:21.054 --> 00:12:23.130
The Ministry of Finance, we are told,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.959
is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:30.263
I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.

00:12:30.263 --> 00:12:33.151
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:37.348
is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:39.027
So in fact, you can't ask them anything,

00:12:39.027 --> 00:12:40.720
and they don't have to answer anything.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.542
That is the law since 1999.

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:47.118
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.

00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:50.807
And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,

00:12:50.807 --> 00:12:53.422
so you could understand, as I said, where we are.

00:12:53.422 --> 00:12:54.943
Here is not like anywhere else.

00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:57.921
Question number one:

00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:00.511
I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,

00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:02.983
and if you can't show me the accounts --

00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:04.948
the Minister of Finance is making statements,

00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:07.563
passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.

00:13:07.563 --> 00:13:09.854
What are the figures he's relying on?

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:12.474
It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.

00:13:12.474 --> 00:13:14.073
And they wrote back and said to me,

00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:15.784
well what do you really mean?

00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:18.175
So they hit my question with a question.

00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:21.296
Second point: I want to see

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:24.995
who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.999
Let me pause here to point out to you all

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:30.680
that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.079
That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:36.575
coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich --

00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:38.947
Caribbean country. Okay?

00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:40.495
And I asked the question,

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:44.641
who was getting that three and a half billion dollars?

00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:46.898
And I want to pause again to bring up context,

00:13:46.898 --> 00:13:50.301
because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.

00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:52.871
There's a particular individual who is in the government now.

00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:54.591
The name of the person doesn't matter.

00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:57.143
And that person made a career

00:13:57.143 --> 00:13:59.504
out of using the Freedom of Information Act

00:13:59.504 --> 00:14:01.623
to advance his political cause.

00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:04.866
Okay? His name isn't important.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:07.199
I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.619
The point is, that person made a career out of using

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:12.583
the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:14.897
And the most famous case

00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:17.790
was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.679
where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:23.551
that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,

00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:26.275
and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.

00:14:26.275 --> 00:14:29.266
And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:30.899
Freedom of Information Act,

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.876
to release the information,

00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:36.241
and I thought that was excellent.

00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.407
Fantastic.

00:14:39.407 --> 00:14:41.357
But you see, the question is this:

00:14:41.357 --> 00:14:45.570
If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.300
and to use the court

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.042
to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,

00:14:54.042 --> 00:14:55.733
it must be right and proper

00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:59.874
for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.

00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:02.462
You see? But the Ministry of Finance,

00:15:02.462 --> 00:15:04.064
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,

00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:07.121
wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.

00:15:07.121 --> 00:15:10.110
You see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.244
The third thing I will tell you

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:15.249
is that I also asked

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:18.245
for the directors of CL Financial,

00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:22.590
whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.208
We have an Integrity in Public Life Act

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:28.957
as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:31.245
And public officials are supposed to file

00:15:31.245 --> 00:15:37.710
to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.125
And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:43.004
and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.

00:15:43.004 --> 00:15:47.921
So here we have it. We have a situation where

00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:52.815
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.808
and transparency have all been discarded.

00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:57.052
I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.

00:15:57.052 --> 00:15:59.540
It's been ignored.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.715
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,

00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:05.317
we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.

00:16:05.317 --> 00:16:08.915
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.

00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:11.496
It's also the single largest example

00:16:11.496 --> 00:16:16.508
of public corruption according to this equation.

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:19.477
And this is my reality check.

00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:21.823
Where you have an expenditure of public money

00:16:21.823 --> 00:16:24.778
and it is without accountability

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:26.418
and it's without transparency,

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:28.674
it will always be equal to corruption,

00:16:28.674 --> 00:16:31.879
whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:36.079
it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.390
I'm going to continue the work

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.736
to press on, to get some resolution

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:44.446
of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.

00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:46.998
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.

00:16:46.998 --> 00:16:48.186
We will continue to press on.

00:16:48.186 --> 00:16:50.137
We will continue to work within JCC.

00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:52.838
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context

00:16:52.838 --> 00:16:54.757
and bring something new to the table

00:16:54.757 --> 00:16:56.583
in terms of an international example.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:59.484
We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking

00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:01.801
about her battle against government corruption,

00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:07.238
and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.

00:17:07.238 --> 00:17:11.908
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database

00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:14.687
for Freedom of Information applications,

00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:16.803
and speak with each other.

00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:19.040
I could see what you're applying for.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.572
You could see what I applied for and what replies I got.

00:17:22.572 --> 00:17:25.508
We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database

00:17:25.508 --> 00:17:28.812
and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.

00:17:28.812 --> 00:17:30.452
We need to increase the consciousness.

00:17:30.452 --> 00:17:34.506
The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,

00:17:34.506 --> 00:17:36.284
which is a lovely website from India

00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:38.726
called IPaidABribe.com.

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:40.512
They have international branches,

00:17:40.512 --> 00:17:42.956
and it's important for us to tune into this one.

00:17:42.956 --> 00:17:45.412
IPaidABribe.com is really important,

00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:47.828
a good one to log on to and see.

00:17:47.828 --> 00:17:50.455
I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.

00:17:50.455 --> 00:17:52.676
Discard the first myth; it is a crime.

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:54.994
Discard the second myth; it is a big thing.

00:17:54.994 --> 00:17:57.492
It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.

00:17:57.492 --> 00:17:59.540
And let us continue working together

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.007
to betterment in this situation,

00:18:01.007 --> 00:18:04.817
stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.
