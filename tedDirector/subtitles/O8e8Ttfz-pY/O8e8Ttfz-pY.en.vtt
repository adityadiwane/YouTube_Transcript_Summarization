00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:14.654
When I was a young boy,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.262
I used to gaze through the microscope of my father

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.620
at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.177
And they were remarkably well preserved,

00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:25.422
morphologically just phenomenal.

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:27.616
And we used to imagine that someday,

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.225
they would actually come to life

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.222
and they would crawl out of the resin,

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.966
and, if they could, they would fly away.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.342
If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.540
we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.015
I would have told you, it's unlikely.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:43.910
If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.062
to revive an extinct species,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.721
I would have said, pipe dream.

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.246
But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:52.253
to tell you that not only is the sequencing

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:56.443
of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,

00:00:56.443 --> 00:01:00.736
but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.575
maybe not from the insects in amber --

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:04.535
in fact, this mosquito was actually used

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.887
for the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" â€”

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:09.447
but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains

00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:11.654
of woolly mammoths in the permafrost.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.727
Woollies are a particularly interesting,

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:16.273
quintessential image of the Ice Age.

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:18.098
They were large. They were hairy.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.082
They had large tusks, and we seem to have

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.982
a very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.497
Maybe it's because elephants share

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:27.319
many things in common with us.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.047
They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:33.067
They have social knits that are very close.

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:35.937
Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:39.275
because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:41.398
some seven million years ago,

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.192
and as habitats changed and environments changed,

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.802
we actually, like the elephants, migrated out

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:50.022
into Europe and Asia.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.725
So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.131
is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall

00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.963
weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species

00:01:59.963 --> 00:02:02.925
and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:05.175
across the Bering land bridge

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:07.485
and into parts of North America.

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:10.173
And then, again, as climate changed as it always does,

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:11.683
and new habitats opened up,

00:02:11.683 --> 00:02:14.159
we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.407
called trogontherii in Central Asia

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.157
pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.

00:02:19.157 --> 00:02:21.552
And the open grassland savannas of North America

00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:23.712
opened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:26.252
a large, hairless species in North America.

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:29.163
And it was really only about 500,000 years later

00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:31.868
that we had the arrival of the woolly,

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.896
the one that we all know and love so much,

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:37.206
spreading from an East Beringian point of origin

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:40.092
across Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.743
out through Central Europe,

00:02:41.743 --> 00:02:43.809
and over hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.893
migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge

00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:48.920
during times of glacial peaks

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.716
and coming into direct contact

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:53.520
with the Columbian relatives living in the south,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.808
and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.985
during traumatic climatic shifts.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:03.201
So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions

00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:06.049
in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.040
And there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.193
and actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.667
and Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.356
So Egyptians are building pyramids

00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:20.122
and woollies are still living on islands.

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:21.671
And then they disappear.

00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.925
Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:27.188
they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:29.286
and fast-encroaching dense forests

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:30.787
that are migrating north,

00:03:30.787 --> 00:03:33.760
and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.511
probably Pleistocene overkill,

00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:38.084
so the large game hunters that took them down.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.346
Fortunately, we find millions of their remains

00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:43.023
strewn across the permafrost buried deep

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.148
in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:48.058
and actually take them out.

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.582
And the preservation is, again,

00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:52.152
like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.

00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:55.672
So you have teeth, bones with blood

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:57.712
which look like blood, you have hair,

00:03:57.712 --> 00:03:59.239
and you have intact carcasses or heads

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.182
which still have brains in them.

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:04.553
So the preservation and the survival of DNA

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:06.625
depends on many factors, and I have to admit,

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.953
most of which we still don't quite understand,

00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:11.025
but depending upon when an organism dies

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:15.514
and how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:18.816
the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:21.384
will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive

00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:24.245
over geologically meaningful time frames.

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:25.889
And it's probably surprising to many of you

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.029
sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.656
it's not the length of preservation,

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:34.638
it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.

00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:37.457
So if we were to go deep now within the bones

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:40.432
and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:43.824
the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:46.192
around histone proteins, is now under attack

00:04:46.192 --> 00:04:49.158
by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth

00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:50.968
for years during its lifetime.

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:54.169
So those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.872
free water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA

00:04:57.872 --> 00:05:00.417
into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.738
until all you have are fragments that range

00:05:02.738 --> 00:05:05.419
from 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.792
a few hundred base pairs in length.

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:10.103
So most fossils out there in the fossil record

00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:12.816
are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.

00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:15.249
But a few of them actually have DNA fragments

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.123
that survive for thousands,

00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:20.872
even a few millions of years in time.

00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:23.060
And using state-of-the-art clean room technology,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.724
we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.228
away from all the rest of the gunk in there,

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.427
and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:32.548
that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:35.547
and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,

00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:39.358
but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,

00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:41.605
and, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA

00:05:41.605 --> 00:05:43.789
that survived in that environment with it,

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.963
so the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:49.368
Not surprising then again that a mammoth

00:05:49.368 --> 00:05:51.040
preserved in the permafrost will have something

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.908
on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:55.931
whereas something like the Columbian mammoth,

00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:58.548
living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:02.365
over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:04.808
But we've come up with very clever ways

00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:07.914
that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,

00:06:07.914 --> 00:06:09.889
the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.439
and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.276
we can actually pull out and bioinformatically

00:06:15.276 --> 00:06:18.245
re-jig all these small mammoth fragments

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:20.542
and place them onto a backbone

00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:23.101
of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.

00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:25.677
And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.502
that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,

00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:31.541
and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.694
Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:38.235
and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.

00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:41.420
So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.997
but an elephant and mammoth genome

00:06:42.997 --> 00:06:45.653
is about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that

00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:48.277
is composed of small, repetitive DNAs

00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:52.910
that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.271
So having this information allows us to answer

00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:57.406
one of the interesting relationship questions

00:06:57.406 --> 00:06:59.578
between mammoths and their living relatives,

00:06:59.578 --> 00:07:01.622
the African and the Asian elephant,

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.789
all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.878
but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share

00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:09.658
a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants

00:07:09.658 --> 00:07:11.074
about six million years ago,

00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:13.547
so slightly closer to the Asian elephant.

00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:16.271
With advances in ancient DNA technology,

00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:18.224
we can actually now start to begin to sequence

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:21.535
the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:23.422
and I just wanted to talk about two of them,

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:25.476
the woolly and the Columbian mammoth,

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:27.894
both of which were living very close to each other

00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.519
during glacial peaks,

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.682
so when the glaciers were massive in North America,

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:35.277
the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,

00:07:35.277 --> 00:07:38.488
and came into contact with the relatives living to the south,

00:07:38.488 --> 00:07:40.500
and there they shared refugia,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.884
and a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.

00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:45.384
It looks like they were interbreeding.

00:07:45.384 --> 00:07:47.017
And that this is not an uncommon feature

00:07:47.017 --> 00:07:48.655
in Proboscideans, because it turns out

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:51.568
that large savanna male elephants will outcompete

00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:54.936
the smaller forest elephants for their females.

00:07:54.936 --> 00:07:57.248
So large, hairless Columbians

00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:59.051
outcompeting the smaller male woollies.

00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:01.669
It reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.008
(Laughter)

00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:06.702
So this is not trivial, given the idea that we want

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:08.907
to revive extinct species, because it turns out

00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:10.727
that an African and an Asian elephant

00:08:10.727 --> 00:08:12.822
can actually interbreed and have live young,

00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:14.963
and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo

00:08:14.963 --> 00:08:18.005
in Chester, U.K., in 1978.

00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:21.151
So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,

00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:23.309
modify them into all those positions we've actually now

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.693
been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,

00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:28.474
we can put that into an enucleated cell,

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.733
differentiate that into a stem cell,

00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:33.053
subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,

00:08:33.053 --> 00:08:35.677
artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,

00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:38.784
and over a long and arduous procedure,

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:42.293
actually bring back something that looks like this.

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:43.983
Now, this wouldn't be an exact replica,

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.465
because the short DNA fragments that I told you about

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.946
will prevent us from building the exact structure,

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.482
but it would make something that looked and felt

00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:53.589
very much like a woolly mammoth did.

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:56.333
Now, when I bring up this with my friends,

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:58.941
we often talk about, well, where would you put it?

00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:00.629
Where are you going to house a mammoth?

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:02.669
There's no climates or habitats suitable.

00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:04.009
Well, that's not actually the case.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.902
It turns out that there are swaths of habitat

00:09:06.902 --> 00:09:09.237
in the north of Siberia and Yukon

00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:10.443
that actually could house a mammoth.

00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:12.688
Remember, this was a highly plastic animal

00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:15.349
that lived over tremendous climate variation.

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:18.231
So this landscape would be easily able to house it,

00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:21.891
and I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,

00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:23.176
the boy in me, that would love to see

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:26.022
these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost

00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:28.477
of the north once again, but I do have to admit

00:09:28.477 --> 00:09:30.621
that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:33.026
whether or not we should.

00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:34.711
Thank you very much.

00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.909
(Applause)

00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:41.426
Ryan Phelan: Don't go away.

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:43.158
You've left us with a question.

00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:46.682
I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?"

00:09:46.682 --> 00:09:49.291
it feels like you're reticent there,

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.269
and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:53.595
What's your reticence?

00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:54.901
Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.

00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.699
I think it's just that we have to think very deeply

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:01.250
about the implications, ramifications of our actions,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.450
and so as long as we have good, deep discussion

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.466
like we're having now, I think

00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:08.172
we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:09.809
But I just want to make sure that we spend time

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.658
thinking about why we're doing it first.

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:14.439
RP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:16.903
HP: Thank you. (Applause)
