00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.056
I believe that the secret to producing
extremely drought-tolerant crops,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.296
which should go some way
to providing food security in the world,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.016
lies in resurrection plants,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.176
pictured here, in an extremely
droughted state.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.056
You might think
that these plants look dead,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.376
but they're not.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.856
Give them water,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.320
and they will resurrect, green up,
start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.616
Now, why would I suggest

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080
that producing drought-tolerant crops
will go towards providing food security?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.936
Well, the current world population
is around 7 billion.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.456
And it's estimated that by 2050,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.176
we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.080
with the bulk of this growth
happening in Africa.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.336
The food and agricultural
organizations of the world

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.496
have suggested that we need
a 70 percent increase

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.696
in current agricultural practice

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.960
to meet that demand.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.416
Given that plants
are at the base of the food chain,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.760
most of that's going
to have to come from plants.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.056
That percentage of 70 percent

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.296
does not take into consideration
the potential effects of climate change.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.560
This is taken from a study by Dai
published in 2011,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.176
where he took into consideration

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.576
all the potential effects
of climate change

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.736
and expressed them --
amongst other things --

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.376
increased aridity due to lack of rain
or infrequent rain.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.176
The areas in red shown here,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.256
are areas that until recently

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.456
have been very successfully
used for agriculture,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.880
but cannot anymore
because of lack of rainfall.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.560
This is the situation
that's predicted to happen in 2050.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.016
Much of Africa,
in fact, much of the world,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.936
is going to be in trouble.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.616
We're going to have to think of some
very smart ways of producing food.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.936
And preferably among them,
some drought-tolerant crops.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.016
The other thing
to remember about Africa is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.840
that most of their agriculture is rainfed.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.536
Now, making drought-tolerant crops
is not the easiest thing in the world.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.976
And the reason for this is water.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.136
Water is essential to life on this planet.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.295
All living, actively
metabolizing organisms,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.376
from microbes to you and I,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.736
are comprised predominately of water.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.296
All life reactions happen in water.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.336
And loss of a small amount
of water results in death.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.416
You and I are 65 percent water --

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.160
we lose one percent of that, we die.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560
But we can make behavioral
changes to avoid that.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.496
Plants can't.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.136
They're stuck in the ground.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.536
And so in the first instance they have
a little bit more water than us,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.816
about 95 percent water,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.936
and they can lose
a little bit more than us,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.920
like 10 to about 70 percent,
depending on the species,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.360
but for short periods only.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.856
Most of them will either try
to resist or avoid water loss.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.816
So extreme examples of resistors
can be found in succulents.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.656
They tend to be small, very attractive,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.416
but they hold onto their water
at such great cost

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.440
that they grow extremely slowly.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.016
Examples of avoidance of water loss
are found in trees and shrubs.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.616
They send down very deep roots,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.336
mine subterranean water supplies

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.816
and just keep flushing
it through them at all times,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.696
keeping themselves hydrated.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.696
The one on the right is called a baobab.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.776
It's also called the upside-down tree,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.576
simply because the proportion
of roots to shoots is so great

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.296
that it looks like the tree
has been planted upside down.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.560
And of course the roots are required
for hydration of that plant.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.280
And probably the most common strategy
of avoidance is found in annuals.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.016
Annuals make up the bulk
of our plant food supplies.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.736
Up the west coast of my country,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.296
for much of the year
you don't see much vegetation growth.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.976
But come the spring rains, you get this:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.240
flowering of the desert.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.856
The strategy in annuals,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.240
is to grow only in the rainy season.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.256
At the end of that season
they produce a seed,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.096
which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.776
but very much alive.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.696
And anything that is
that dry and still alive,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.200
we call desiccation-tolerant.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.256
In the desiccated state,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.936
what seeds can do
is lie in extremes of environment

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.616
for prolonged periods of time.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.856
The next time the rainy season comes,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.376
they germinate and grow,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.280
and the whole cycle just starts again.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.176
It's widely believed that the evolution
of desiccation-tolerant seeds

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.376
allowed the colonization and the radiation

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.920
of flowering plants,
or angiosperms, onto land.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.120
But back to annuals
as our major form of food supplies.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.520
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent
of our plant food supplies.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.016
And it's been a great strategy

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.216
because in a short space of time
you can produce a lot of seed.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.860
Seeds are energy-rich
so there's a lot of food calories,

00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:59.804
you can store it in times of plenty
for times of famine,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.720
but there's a downside.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.936
The vegetative tissues,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.136
the roots and leaves of annuals,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.416
do not have much

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.536
by way of inherent resistance,
avoidance or tolerance characteristics.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.856
They just don't need them.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.296
They grow in the rainy season

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.696
and they've got a seed
to help them survive the rest of the year.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.416
And so despite concerted
efforts in agriculture

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.976
to make crops with improved properties

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.176
of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.096
particularly resistance and avoidance

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.016
because we've had good models
to understand how those work --

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.376
we still get images like this.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.856
Maize crop in Africa,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.296
two weeks without rain

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.520
and it's dead.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.800
There is a solution:

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.760
resurrection plants.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.096
These plants can lose 95 percent
of their cellular water,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.976
remain in a dry, dead-like state
for months to years,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.736
and give them water,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.640
they green up and start growing again.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.856
Like seeds, these are
desiccation-tolerant.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.000
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes
of environmental conditions.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.776
And this is a really rare phenomenon.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.176
There are only 135 flowering
plant species that can do this.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.616
I'm going to show you a video

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.256
of the resurrection process
of these three species

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.496
in that order.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.776
And at the bottom,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.536
there's a time axis
so you can see how quickly it happens.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.200
(Applause)

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.776
Pretty amazing, huh?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.016
So I've spent the last 21 years
trying to understand how they do this.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.440
How do these plants dry without dying?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.856
And I work on a variety
of different resurrection plants,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.296
shown here in the hydrated and dry states,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.776
for a number of reasons.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.656
One of them is that each
of these plants serves as a model

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.056
for a crop that I'd like
to make drought-tolerant.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.016
So on the extreme top left,
for example, is a grass,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.296
it's called Eragrostis nindensis,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.696
it's got a close relative
called Eragrostis tef --

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.736
a lot of you might know it as "teff" --

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.496
it's a staple food in Ethiopia,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.776
it's gluten-free,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.816
and it's something we would like
to make drought-tolerant.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.256
The other reason for looking
at a number of plants,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.656
is that, at least initially,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.936
I wanted to find out:
do they do the same thing?

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.656
Do they all use the same mechanisms

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.256
to be able to lose
all that water and not die?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.976
So I undertook what we call
a systems biology approach

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.176
in order to get
a comprehensive understanding

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.216
of desiccation tolerance,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.696
in which we look at everything

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.632
from the molecular to the whole plant,
ecophysiological level.

00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:02.291
For example we look at things like

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:04.513
changes in the plant anatomy
as they dried out

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:05.776
and their ultrastructure.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.976
We look at the transcriptome,
which is just a term for a technology

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.416
in which we look at the genes

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.856
that are switched on or off,
in response to drying.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.096
Most genes will code for proteins,
so we look at the proteome.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.520
What are the proteins made
in response to drying?

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.376
Some proteins would code for enzymes
which make metabolites,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.976
so we look at the metabolome.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.296
Now, this is important
because plants are stuck in the ground.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.416
They use what I call
a highly tuned chemical arsenal

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.856
to protect themselves from all
the stresses of their environment.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.376
So it's important that we look

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.840
at the chemical changes
involved in drying.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.176
And at the last study
that we do at the molecular level,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.456
we look at the lipidome --

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.535
the lipid changes in response to drying.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.816
And that's also important

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.655
because all biological membranes
are made of lipids.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:53.256
They're held as membranes
because they're in water.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.520
Take away the water,
those membranes fall apart.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.280
Lipids also act as signals
to turn on genes.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.896
Then we use physiological
and biochemical studies

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.136
to try and understand
the function of the putative protectants

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.096
that we've actually discovered
in our other studies.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.296
And then use all of that
to try and understand

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.640
how the plant copes
with its natural environment.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.816
I've always had the philosophy that
I needed a comprehensive understanding

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.096
of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.960
in order to make a meaningful suggestion
for a biotic application.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.656
I'm sure some of you are thinking,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.936
"By biotic application,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.880
does she mean she's going to make
genetically modified crops?"

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.936
And the answer to that question is:

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.341
depends on your definition
of genetic modification.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.016
All of the crops that we eat today,
wheat, rice and maize,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.256
are highly genetically modified
from their ancestors,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.256
but we don't consider them GM

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.920
because they're being produced
by conventional breeding.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.656
If you mean, am I going to put
resurrection plant genes into crops,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.976
your answer is yes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.136
In the essence of time,
we have tried that approach.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.016
More appropriately,
some of my collaborators at UCT,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.976
Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.616
have spearheaded that approach

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.593
and I'm going to show you some data soon.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.216
But we're about to embark
upon an extremely ambitious approach,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.696
in which we aim to turn on
whole suites of genes

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.416
that are already present in every crop.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.345
They're just never turned on
under extreme drought conditions.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.256
I leave it up to you to decide

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.233
whether those should be called GM or not.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.016
I'm going to now just give you
some of the data from that first approach.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.296
And in order to do that

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.976
I have to explain a little bit
about how genes work.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.256
So you probably all know

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.336
that genes are made
of double-stranded DNA.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.296
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.480
that are present in every cell
of your body or in a plant's body.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.160
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.296
And each gene has a promoter,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.696
which is just an on-off switch,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.136
the gene coding region,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.416
and then a terminator,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.040
which indicates that this is the end
of this gene, the next gene will start.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.616
Now, promoters are not
simple on-off switches.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.336
They normally require
a lot of fine-tuning,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.400
lots of things to be present and correct
before that gene is switched on.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.296
So what's typically done
in biotech studies

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.136
is that we use an inducible promoter,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.736
we know how to switch it on.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.776
We couple that to genes of interest

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.480
and put that into a plant
and see how the plant responds.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.696
In the study that I'm going
to talk to you about,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.176
my collaborators used
a drought-induced promoter,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.616
which we discovered
in a resurrection plant.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.776
The nice thing about this promoter
is that we do nothing.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.880
The plant itself senses drought.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.696
And we've used it to drive antioxidant
genes from resurrection plants.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.576
Why antioxidant genes?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.656
Well, all stresses,
particularly drought stress,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.976
results in the formation of free radicals,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.336
or reactive oxygen species,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.080
which are highly damaging
and can cause crop death.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.280
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.256
So here's some data from a maize strain
that's very popularly used in Africa.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.576
To the left of the arrow
are plants without the genes,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.856
to the right --

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.936
plants with the antioxidant genes.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.776
After three weeks without watering,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.280
the ones with the genes
do a hell of a lot better.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.056
Now to the final approach.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.616
My research has shown
that there's considerable similarity

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.056
in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
in seeds and resurrection plants.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.496
So I ask the question,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.960
are they using the same genes?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.736
Or slightly differently phrased,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.256
are resurrection plants using genes
evolved in seed desiccation tolerance

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.536
in their roots and leaves?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.616
Have they retasked these seed genes

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.680
in roots and leaves
of resurrection plants?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.616
And I answer that question,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.056
as a consequence of a lot
of research from my group

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.616
and recent collaborations from a group
of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.216
Mel Oliver in the United States

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.840
and Julia Buitink in France.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.296
The answer is yes,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.176
that there is a core set of genes
that are involved in both.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.616
And I'm going to illustrate this
very crudely for maize,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.056
where the chromosomes below the off switch

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.655
represent all the genes that are required
for desiccation tolerance.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.936
So as maize seeds dried out
at the end of their period of development,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.320
they switch these genes on.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.576
Resurrection plants
switch on the same genes

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.256
when they dry out.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.056
All modern crops, therefore,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.136
have these genes
in their roots and leaves,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.896
they just never switch them on.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.880
They only switch them on in seed tissues.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.176
So what we're trying to do right now

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.816
is to understand the environmental
and cellular signals

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.280
that switch on these genes
in resurrection plants,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.040
to mimic the process in crops.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.416
And just a final thought.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.656
What we're trying to do very rapidly

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.496
is to repeat what nature did
in the evolution of resurrection plants

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.360
some 10 to 40 million years ago.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.656
My plants and I thank you
for your attention.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:54.915
(Applause)
