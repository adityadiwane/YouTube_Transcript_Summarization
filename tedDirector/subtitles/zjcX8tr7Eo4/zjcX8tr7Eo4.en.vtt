00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When I'm starting talks like this,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
because a lot of people out there don't know what that is.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is a crowd that does know what it is,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Fill in the blanks.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you know, sustainability, small planet.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You know, about a million years ago,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
got a little clever, harnessed fire,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
invented the printing press,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's got some major, major flaws.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
How much stuff goes through your life,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
how much waste is left behind you.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And we, at the moment, in our society,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We're using up about five planets.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If everybody on the planet lived the way we did,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we'd need between five, six, seven,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
some people even say 10 planets to make it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Clearly we don't have 10 planets.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
10 planets, one planet. Right?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We don't have that. So that's one problem.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The second problem is that the planet that we have

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
North Americans, such as myself, you know,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and we're eating all sorts of stuff.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And, you know, then you get all the way down

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And people simply do not have enough to survive.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is producing all sorts of tensions,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And there's more and more people on the way. Right?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A third of the people on this planet are kids.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
than their parents did, no matter where they live.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And they may not want to live exactly like us.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or Germans, or South Africans,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but they want their own version

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and more, you know, enjoyable.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And all of these things combine to create

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
an enormous amount of torque on the planet.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
facing situations which are simply unthinkable.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I don't need to go into that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But I will ask the question, what's the alternative?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
on the other hand we have the unimaginable.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We don't know yet how to build a society

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which is environmentally sustainable,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which is shareable with everybody on the planet,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which promotes stability and democracy and human rights,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to make it through the challenges we face.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We don't know how to do this yet.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So what's Worldchanging?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Well, Worldchanging you might think of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You know, what we're out there doing is looking

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
for examples of tools, models and ideas,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
which, if widely adopted, would change the game.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but most people haven't.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I thought today I'd do something a little different,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
rather than giving you tried-and-true examples.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
for changing the impact that we have on the planet

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is changing the way that we live in cities.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We're already an urban planet;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that's especially true in the developed world.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And people who live in cities in the developed world

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
If we can change the dynamic,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And they are doing density, new density,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
which is a pretty great thing.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So you have density. You also have growth management.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You leave aside what is natural to be natural.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
This is in Portland. That is an actual development.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They've bounded the city with a line.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Nature, city. Nothing changes.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You can start doing things like, you know,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
transit systems that actually work to transport people,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
You can also start to change what you build.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that recycle much of their water,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that are much more comfortable than standard buildings,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But once you also have people living

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in close proximity to each other,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
one of the things you can do is --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
as information technologies develop --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you can start to have smart places.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
You can start to know where things are.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
When you share them, you end up using less.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So one great example is car-share clubs,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
which are really starting to take off in the U.S.,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
do you really need your own car?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Another thing that information technology lets us do

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is start figuring out how to use less stuff

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
which I think is a pretty cool concept,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
although I think it ought to work the other way around,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that it gets brighter the more you don't use.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We could just re-label things.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and on the other hand, off.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
How we build things can change as well.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This is a bio-morphic building.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
It takes its inspiration in form from life.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and also much more effective.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is an example of bio-mimicry,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
In this case, you have a shell design

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We're starting to cover this more and more.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There's also neo-biological design,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where more and more we're actually using life itself

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and the processes of life to become part of our industry.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
of how to take the cities most of us live in,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and turn them into Bright Green cities.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And there's a statistic I often like to use,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I was giving a talk about two months ago,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and was really flustered, and he said, look,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It's every seven days.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
They don't have existing infrastructure;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
how to do things in new ways.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So what do we need in order to make developing nation

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
megacities into Bright Green megacities?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The idea behind leapfrogging is that

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That you're much better off, almost universally,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
skipping the whole landline stage.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If there are landlines in many developing world cities,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and cost enormous amounts of money.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So I rather like this picture here.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We've heard all about this here this week,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The second thing is tools for collaboration,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
which encourage collaboration. Right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
you get different kinds of solutions.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And those solutions are accessible in a different way

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
to people who don't have capital. Right?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So, you know, we have open source software,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And those things lead to things like this.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This is a pretty remarkable program

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and basically sort of abandoned buildings --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
has put together a bunch of community centers

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
where people can come in, get high-speed internet access,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
learn computer programming skills for free.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and re-categorizing itself in ways

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that have less and less to do with most of us in this room.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It's doing something new. There's new things happening.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You have other radical examples

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
These are people who have just been visited by

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the Internet bookmobile in Uganda.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And who are waving their first books in the air,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
in ways that haven't happened before.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is we've got to craft new political realities.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
what have you, but here at home as well.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Another world is possible.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
We tweak that a lot.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
there being a different, vague possibility out there,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
How many people knew of Lula before today?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
but one of the things that he's doing is,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
into a whole new way of global collaboration.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I would keep your eye on this fellow.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
This is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in people's interest in and passion for democracy.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
We get so little news about the developing world

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that we often forget that there are literally

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
millions of people out there struggling to change things

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But it's happening all over the place,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and these tools are part of what's making it possible.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now when you add all those things together,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It's the greenest building in the world.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
You get grassroots solutions, things that work

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
for people who have no capital or limited access.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You get access to distance medicine.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to access databases that have information

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
You get new tools for people in the developing world.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
for whom nightfall means darkness,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
to have a new means of operating.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
These are refrigerators that require no electricity;

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
they're pot within a pot design.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and available to people in the developing world.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Here's a way of transporting water.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I mean, that's a great design.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Basically you can suck any water through this

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
which pumps water as kids play. You know?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
because of climate change and political instability.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
How do we help people like that?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Some of those designs include models for acting,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
New models for pedagogy for the displaced.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And we have new tools.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Does anyone know what this is?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Audience: It detects landmines.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
If you are living in one of the places

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
you can fling these seeds out into the field.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
their roots will detect the chemicals in them,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and where the flowers turn red you don't step.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
(Applause)

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I also love it because it seems to me

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
that the example, the tools we use to change the world,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
ought to be beautiful in themselves.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
You know, that it's not just enough to survive.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
We've got to make something better than what we've got.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And I think that we will.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I think that better things are on the way.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
All that the human mind has accomplished

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
is but the dream before the awakening."

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I hope that that turns out to be true.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Applause)
