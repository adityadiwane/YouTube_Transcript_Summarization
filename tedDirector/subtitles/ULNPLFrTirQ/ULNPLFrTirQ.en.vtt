00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.105
So, I love making tools
and sharing them with people.

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:18.328
I remember as a child,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.645
my first tool I built
was actually a microscope

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.341
that I built by stealing lenses
from my brother's eyeglasses.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.896
He wasn't that thrilled.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.090
But, you know, maybe
because of that moment,

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:31.267
30 years later,

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.179
I'm still making microscopes.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.478
And the reason I built these tools
is for moments like this.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.799
(Video) Girl: I have
black things in my hair --

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:44.098
Manu Prakash: This is a school
in the Bay Area.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.124
(Video) MP: The living world
far supersedes our imagination

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.115
of how things actually work.

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.590
(Video) Boy: Oh my God!

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:57.945
MP: Right -- oh my God!

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.442
I hadn't realized this would be
such a universal phrase.

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:04.743
Over the last two years,

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.934
in my lab,

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.033
we built 50,000 Foldscopes

00:01:08.057 --> 00:01:10.967
and shipped them
to 130 countries in the world,

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.577
at no cost to the kids we sent them to.

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:15.301
This year alone,

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.457
with the support of our community,

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.961
we are planning to ship
a million microscopes

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.347
to kids around the world.

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:23.424
What does that do?

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:27.204
It creates an inspiring community
of people around the world,

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:28.900
learning and teaching each other,

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:33.014
from Kenya to Kampala
to Kathmandu to Kansas.

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.683
And one of the phenomenal things
that I love about this

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.263
is the sense of community.

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.083
There's a kid in Nicaragua

00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:43.301
teaching others how to identify
mosquito species that carry dengue

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.743
by looking at the larva
under a microscope.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.315
There's a pharmacologist
who came up with a new way

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:50.582
to detect fake drugs anywhere.

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:53.281
There is a girl who wondered:

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:55.003
"How does glitter actually work?"

00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:58.746
and discovered the physics
of crystalline formation in glitter.

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.138
There is an Argentinian doctor

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:05.424
who's trying to do field cervical cancer
screening with this tool.

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:09.186
And yours very truly found
a species of flea

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.986
that was dug inside my heel in my foot
one centimeter deep.

00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:19.398
Now, you might think
of these as anomalies.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:21.815
But there is a method to this madness.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:24.667
I call this "frugal science" --

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:28.543
the idea of sharing
the experience of science,

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.282
and not just the information.

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.046
To remind you:

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.154
there are a billion people on this planet

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:36.693
who live with absolutely
no infrastructure:

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:38.331
no roads,

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.737
no electricity

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.547
and thus, no health care.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:47.023
Also, there a billion kids
on this planet that live in poverty.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.188
How are we supposed to inspire them

00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:51.534
for the next generation
of solution makers?

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:54.832
There are health care workers
that we put on the line

00:02:54.856 --> 00:02:56.774
to fight infectious diseases,

00:02:56.798 --> 00:03:01.255
to protect us with absolutely
bare-minimum tools and resources.

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:03.998
So as a lab at Stanford,

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:07.959
I think of this from a context
of frugal science

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:10.568
and building solutions
for these communities.

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:15.174
Often we think about being able to do
diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:18.365
I'll tell you two examples
today of new tools.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.194
One of them starts in Uganda.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:22.100
In 2013,

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:26.170
on a field trip to detect
schistosomiasis with Foldscopes,

00:03:26.194 --> 00:03:28.752
I made a minor observation.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:30.353
In a clinic,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.716
in a far, remote area,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.328
I saw a centrifuge
being used as a doorstop.

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:38.403
I mean -- quite literally, the doorstop.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.153
And I asked them and they said,

00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:42.204
"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,

00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:45.757
so this piece of junk
is good as a doorstop."

00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:49.146
Centrifuges, for some of you
who don't know,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.394
are the pinnacle tool to be able
to do sample processing.

00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:55.160
You separate components
of blood or body fluids

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:57.644
to be able to detect
and identify pathogens.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.073
But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:03.291
cost around 1,000 dollars --

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:05.321
and really hard to carry out in the field.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.502
And of course,

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:07.960
they don't work without power.

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:09.376
Sound familiar?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.948
So we started thinking
about solving this problem,

00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:13.522
and I came back --

00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:15.212
kept thinking about toys.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:16.802
Now ...

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.608
I have a few with me here.

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:21.739
I first started with yo-yos ...

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:24.394
and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.424
Because these objects spin,

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:27.610
we wondered,

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.991
could we actually use
the physics of these objects

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:31.724
to be able to build centrifuges?

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:35.567
This was possibly the worst
throw I could make.

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:37.749
But you might start realizing,

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.612
if you start exploring
the space of toys --

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:43.241
we tried these spinning tops,

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:45.147
and then in the lab,

00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:47.253
we stumbled upon this wonder.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.076
It's the whirligig,
or a buzzer, or a rundle.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.517
A couple of strings and a little disk,

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.748
and if I push, it spins.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.514
How many of you have played
with this as a kid?

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:00.386
This is called a button-on-a-string.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.046
OK, maybe 50 percent of you.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.628
What you didn't realize --

00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:05.965
that this little object

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:10.352
is the oldest toy
in the history of mankind ...

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:12.472
5,000 years ago.

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:16.195
We have found relics of this object
hidden around on our planet.

00:05:16.924 --> 00:05:18.865
Now the irony is,

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.624
we actually don't understand
how this little thing works.

00:05:22.648 --> 00:05:24.051
That's when I get excited.

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.698
So we got back to work,

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:28.512
wrote down a couple of equations.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:32.189
If you take the input torque
that you put in,

00:05:32.213 --> 00:05:34.317
you take the drag on this disc,

00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:36.246
and the twist drag on these strings,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.759
you should be able
to mathematically solve this.

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:41.591
This is not the only equation in my talk.

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.447
Ten pages of math later,

00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:46.330
we could actually write down
the complete analytical solution

00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:47.628
for this dynamic system.

00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:51.819
And out comes what we call "Paperfuge."

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:54.387
That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,

00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:56.078
who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:58.347
And to the left, you see
all the centrifuges

00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.798
that we're trying to replace.

00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:03.529
This little object that you see right here

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.004
is a disc, a couple
of strings and a handle.

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:09.202
And when I spin

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.913
and I push,

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.089
it starts to spin.

00:06:12.113 --> 00:06:14.198
Now, when you realize,

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.165
when you do the math,

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.889
when we calculate the rpm for this object,

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:24.645
mathematically, we should be able
to go all the way to a million rpm.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.862
Now, there is a little twist
in human anatomy,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.961
because the resonant frequency
of this object is about 10 hertz,

00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:31.789
and if you've ever played the piano,

00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:33.907
you can't go higher
than two or three hertz.

00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:37.195
The maximum speed we've been able
to achieve with this object

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.148
is not 10,000 rpm,

00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:40.776
not 50,000 rpm --

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.725
120,000 rpm.

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.553
That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.784
If I was to stick you right here
and have it spin,

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:52.237
you would think about the types
of forces you would experience.

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:54.499
One of the factors of a tool like this

00:06:54.523 --> 00:06:57.517
is to be able to do diagnosis with this.

00:06:57.541 --> 00:07:01.821
So, I'm going to do
a quick demo here, where --

00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:05.857
this is a moment where I'm going
to make a little finger prick,

00:07:05.881 --> 00:07:08.156
and a tiny drop of blood
is going to come out.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.801
If you don't like blood,
you don't have to look at it.

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.164
Here is a little lancet.

00:07:12.188 --> 00:07:14.058
These lancets are available everywhere,

00:07:14.082 --> 00:07:15.605
completely passive.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.215
And if I've had breakfast today ...

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.354
That didn't hurt at all.

00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:27.362
OK, I take a little capillary
with a drop of blood --

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:29.645
now this drop of blood has answers,

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.348
that's why I'm interested in it.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.197
It might actually tell me whether
I have malaria right now or not.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.053
I take a little capillary,

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:39.202
and you see it starts wicking in.

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.976
I'm going to draw a little more blood.

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:46.845
And that's good enough for right now.

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:51.469
Now, I just seal this capillary
by putting it in clay.

00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:57.592
And now that's sealed the sample.

00:07:57.616 --> 00:07:59.745
We're going to take the sample,

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:01.733
mount it on Paperfuge.

00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:12.300
A little piece of tape
to make a sealed cavity.

00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:15.690
So now the sample is completely enclosed.

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:21.220
And we are ready for a spin.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.880
I'm pushing and pulling with this object.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.603
I'm going to load this up ...

00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:30.380
And you see the object starts spinning.

00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:32.418
Unlike a regular centrifuge,

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:36.221
this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:38.581
It goes back and forth, back and forth ...

00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:41.169
And now I'm charging it up,

00:08:41.193 --> 00:08:43.021
and you see it builds momentum.

00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:46.617
And now -- I don't know
if you can hear this --

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.180
30 seconds of this,

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:53.134
and I should be able to separate
all the blood cells with the plasma.

00:08:53.758 --> 00:08:56.571
And the ratio of those blood 
cells to plasma --

00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.609
(Applause)

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.594
Already, if you see right here,

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:05.650
if you focus on this,

00:09:05.674 --> 00:09:08.219
you should be able to see
a separated volume

00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:10.950
of blood and plasma.

00:09:10.974 --> 00:09:14.897
And the ratio of that actually tells me
whether I might be anemic.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:18.958
One of the aspects of this is,
we build many types of Paperfuges.

00:09:18.982 --> 00:09:23.448
This one allows us to identify
malaria parasites

00:09:23.472 --> 00:09:25.289
by running them for a little longer,

00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:28.879
and we can identify malaria parasites
that are in the blood

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:32.477
that we can separate out and detect
with something like a centrifuge.

00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:36.981
Another version of this allows me
to separate nucleic acids

00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:40.562
to be able to do nucleic acid tests
out in the field itself.

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:45.737
Here is another version that allows me
to separate bulk samples,

00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:47.331
and then, finally,

00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.355
something new that we've been working on

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:54.174
to be able to implement the entire
multiplex test on an object like this.

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:58.535
So where you do the sample preparation
and the chemistry in the same object.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.646
Now ...

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.940
this is all good,

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:03.871
but when you start thinking about this,

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.984
you have to share these tools with people.

00:10:06.008 --> 00:10:09.390
And one of the things we did is --
we just got back from Madagascar;

00:10:09.414 --> 00:10:11.992
this is what clinical trials
for malaria look like --

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:13.019
(Laughter)

00:10:13.043 --> 00:10:15.400
You can do this while having coffee.

00:10:15.424 --> 00:10:17.297
But most importantly,

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:21.383
this is a village six hours from any road.

00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:26.419
We are in a room with one of the senior
members of the community

00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:27.956
and a health care worker.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.477
It really is this portion of the work
that excites me the most --

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:32.659
that smile,

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:36.557
to be able to share simple but powerful
tools with people around the world.

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:39.601
Now, I forgot to tell you this,

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.028
that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.212
OK, in the negative time I have left,

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:48.302
I'll tell you about the most recent --

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.446
(Laughter)

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.340
invention from our lab.

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:52.717
It's called Abuzz --

00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:57.572
the idea that all of you
could help us fight mosquitoes;

00:10:57.596 --> 00:10:59.863
you could all help us track our enemies.

00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:03.875
These are enemies because they cause
malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:08.683
But the challenge is that we actually
don't know where our enemies are.

00:11:08.707 --> 00:11:11.686
The world map for where
mosquitoes are is missing.

00:11:12.123 --> 00:11:13.866
So we started thinking about this.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.925
There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:17.352
and they're all very similar.

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.815
Some of them are so identical

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:22.227
that even an entomologist cannot
identify them under a microscope.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.701
But they have an Achilles' heel.

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:27.925
This is what mosquitoes flirting
with each other looks like.

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:30.178
That's a male chasing a female.

00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:34.023
They're actually talking to each other
with their wingbeat frequencies.

00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:35.087
(Buzzing sound)

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.468
And thus, they have a signature.

00:11:38.472 --> 00:11:41.836
We realized that using a regular phone,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.401
a $5-10 flip phone --

00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:46.527
how many remember what this object is?

00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.611
(Laughter)

00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:51.796
We can record these acoustic
signatures from mosquitoes.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.756
I'll tell you exactly how to do this.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.471
I caught some mosquitoes outside.

00:11:55.495 --> 00:11:57.883
Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm not
going to release them.

00:11:57.907 --> 00:11:58.947
(Laughter)

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:01.546
But I will tell you how
to record from this.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.012
All you do is tap them and they fly.

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.377
You can first test --

00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:07.153
I can actually hear that.

00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:09.631
And you bring your phone,
which has microphones --

00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:12.021
it turns out the mics
are so damn good already,

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:13.285
even on regular phones,

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:15.742
that you can pick up
this near-field signature.

00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:17.904
And since I'm out of time,

00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:21.620
let me just play the recording
that I made a day ago.

00:12:21.644 --> 00:12:24.184
(Mosquitoes buzz)

00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:27.136
This is all the charming sound
that you heard before

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.344
that you all love.

00:12:30.606 --> 00:12:32.027
One of the contexts of this

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.265
is that being able to do this
with a regular cell phone

00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:38.449
allows us to map mosquito species.

00:12:39.477 --> 00:12:41.169
Using a flip phone,

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:44.171
we mapped one of the largest
acoustic databases

00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:49.423
with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes
that carry human pathogens.

00:12:49.447 --> 00:12:51.126
And from this and machine learning,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.934
anybody who uploads this data,

00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.946
we can identify and tell the probability

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.804
of what species of mosquitoes
you're actually working with.

00:12:57.828 --> 00:13:00.643
We call this Abuzz,
and if any of you want to sign up,

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:01.885
just go to the website.

00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:03.985
Let me close with something

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:06.310
that's very important
and dear to my heart.

00:13:07.324 --> 00:13:11.271
One of the challenges of today
is we have terrible problems.

00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:14.193
We have a billion people
with absolutely no health care,

00:13:14.217 --> 00:13:16.342
climate change, biodiversity loss,

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:17.551
on and on and on.

00:13:18.046 --> 00:13:20.996
And we hope that science
is going to provide the answer.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.558
But before you leave this theatre today,

00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:25.336
I want you to promise one thing.

00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:28.123
We're going to make science accessible --

00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:31.025
not just to the people who can afford it,

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:32.931
but a billion others who can't.

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:37.597
Let's make science and scientific
literacy a human right.

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:44.059
The moment that you pass the tingling
feeling of making a discovery

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.594
to another child,

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:50.055
you're enabling them to be
the next group of people

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.187
who will actually solve these problems.

00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:53.386
Thank you.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.788
(Applause)
