00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The question is, why?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So here's the first punch line:

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
cities have defused the population bomb.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And here's the second punch line.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now we're shining right back up.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Thank you.
