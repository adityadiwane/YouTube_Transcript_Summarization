00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.536
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.536
He said, "I'm working with three friends,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.000
and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online."

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.696
And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?"

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.856
"No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out."

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.040
"All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate."

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.720
"Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs."

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.856
Six months go by,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.856
it's the day before the company launches,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.000
and there is still
not a functioning website.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.816
"You guys realize,
the entire company is a website.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.200
That's literally all it is."

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.440
So I obviously declined to invest.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.896
And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.536
(Laughter)

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.320
They sell glasses online.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.696
They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.736
and valued at over a billion dollars.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.080
And now? My wife handles our investments.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.520
Why was I so wrong?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.680
To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals."

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.016
Originals are nonconformists,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.456
people who not only have new ideas

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.320
but take action to champion them.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.456
They are people
who stand out and speak up.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.416
Originals drive creativity
and change in the world.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.576
They're the people you want to bet on.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000
And they look nothing like I expected.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.176
I want to show you today
three things I've learned

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.216
about recognizing originals

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.640
and becoming a little bit more like them.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.776
So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.560
was they were really slow
getting off the ground.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.360
Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.456
Yes, that's an actual term.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.416
You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.360
when you haven't done anything yet.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.096
I just feel that
a few months ahead of time.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.160
(Laughter)

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.576
So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.616
I would wake up at 5am,

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.440
start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.816
Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.816
and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.696
(Laughter)

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.480
(Applause)

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.416
Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.080
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.016
But this served me well in college,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.880
because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.816
And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.856
I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.760
"I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating."

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.576
And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?"

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.696
(Laughter)

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.896
No, she was one
of our most creative students,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.176
and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.216
So I challenged her to get some data.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.936
She goes into a bunch of companies.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.376
She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.016
Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.896
And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.856
who rush in and do everything early

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.616
are rated as less creative

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.600
than people who procrastinate moderately.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.656
So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.576
She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey."

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.096
(Laughter)

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.080
No, here are our results.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.816
You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560
are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.896
And on the flip side,
the people who race in

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.840
are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.720
There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.080
Why is this?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.416
Maybe original people
just have bad work habits.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.560
Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.416
To find out, we designed some experiments.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.255
We asked people
to generate new business ideas,

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.976
and then we get independent readers

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.176
to evaluate how creative
and useful they are.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.616
And some of them are asked
to do the task right away.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.176
Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
by dangling Minesweeper in front of them

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.896
for either five or 10 minutes.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.056
And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.760
are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.776
Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.976
because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.656
there's no creativity boost.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.216
It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.936
and then you start procrastinating,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.496
but the task is still active
in the back of your mind,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.016
that you start to incubate.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.616
Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.760
to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.936
So just as we were finishing
these experiments,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.456
I was starting to write
a book about originals,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.016
and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.120
while writing a chapter
on procrastination."

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.120
So I metaprocrastinated,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.496
and like any self-respecting
precrastinator,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.096
I woke up early the next morning

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.936
and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.480
(Laughter)

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.056
And then I worked diligently

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.720
toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.336
I started writing
the procrastination chapter,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.256
and one day -- I was halfway through --

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.176
I literally put it away in mid-sentence

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.536
for months.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.560
It was agony.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.600
But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.896
As Aaron Sorkin put it,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.880
"You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking."

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.656
And along the way I discovered

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.960
that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.456
Take Leonardo da Vinci.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.016
He toiled on and off for 16 years

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.816
on the Mona Lisa.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.256
He felt like a failure.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.080
He wrote as much in his journal.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.816
But some of the diversions
he took in optics

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.816
transformed the way that he modeled light

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.760
and made him into a much better painter.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.520
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.736
The night before
the biggest speech of his life,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.016
the March on Washington,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.160
he was up past 3am, rewriting it.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.216
He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.040
and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.816
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.776
he leaves his prepared remarks

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.936
to utter four words
that changed the course of history:

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.240
"I have a dream."

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.160
That was not in the script.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.736
By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.496
he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.776
And because the text wasn't set in stone,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.840
he had freedom to improvise.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.816
Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.680
but it can be a virtue for creativity.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.416
What you see with a lot of great originals

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.056
is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.160
And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.376
When they were dragging
their heels for six months,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.016
I looked at them and said,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.496
"You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online."

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.360
They missed the first-mover advantage.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.136
But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.016
trying to figure out how to get people

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.040
to be comfortable ordering glasses online.

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:56.056
And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.896
Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.416
comparing the first movers
who created the market

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.880
with the improvers who introduced
something different and better.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.896
What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.200
compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.536
Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.016
until after Myspace and Friendster.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.816
Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.936
It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.200
than it is to create
something new from scratch.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.976
So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.200
You just have to be different and better.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.336
But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.776
They were also full of doubts.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.616
They had backup plans lined up,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.056
and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.760
because I expected that originals
would look something like this.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.360
(Laughter)

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.296
Now, on the surface,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.296
a lot of original people look confident,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.576
but behind the scenes,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.616
they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.200
They just manage it differently.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.576
Let me show you: this is a depiction

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.920
of how the creative process
works for most of us.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.120
(Laughter)

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.616
Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.296
There's self-doubt and idea doubt.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.856
Self-doubt is paralyzing.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.496
It leads you to freeze.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.256
But idea doubt is energizing.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.056
It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.136
just like MLK did.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.416
And so the key to being original

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.176
is just a simple thing

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.576
of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.416
Instead of saying, "I'm crap,"

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.920
you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.080
and I'm just not there yet."

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.536
So how do you get there?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.456
Well, there's a clue, it turns out,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.440
in the Internet browser that you use.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.616
We can predict your job performance
and your commitment

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.480
just by knowing what web browser you use.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.616
Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study --

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.976
(Laughter)

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.936
But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.320
significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.296
Yes.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.176
(Applause)

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.160
They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.296
Why? It's not a technical advantage.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.696
The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.856
and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.976
It's about how you got the browser.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.456
Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.016
those came preinstalled on your computer,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.840
and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.616
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.896
and ask, is there
a different option out there,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.880
and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.096
So people hear about this study
and they're like,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.816
"Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?"

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.856
(Laughter)

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.976
No, it's about being the kind of person

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.416
who takes the initiative
to doubt the default

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.576
and look for a better option.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.096
And if you do that well,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.920
you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.736
There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760
(Laughter)

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.976
Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.760
and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.536
It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.536
that can't get the green light
for more than half a century.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.760
In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.416
But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.896
She rewrites the first act,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.536
reinvents the villain as a tortured hero

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.520
and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.696
So there's a simple message
from this story.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.320
When you feel doubt, don't let it go.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.960
(Laughter)

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.976
What about fear?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.920
Originals feel fear, too.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.456
They're afraid of failing,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.576
but what sets them apart
from the rest of us

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.216
is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.336
They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.800
or by failing to start a business at all.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.016
They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.696
but our inactions.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.578
The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science,

00:12:18.602 --> 00:12:20.802
are the chances not taken.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.376
Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.136
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.336
would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.560
but it was too important not to try.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.896
And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.160
we don't bother to try.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.016
But I have some good news for you.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.616
You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.256
A lot of people think they will.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.936
If you look across industries

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.389
and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.720
85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.656
They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.096
But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.400
tons of them, in fact.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560
Take the guy who invented this.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.096
Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.520
that it scared not only kids
but adults, too?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.256
No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.920
(Laughter)

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.096
If you look across fields,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.096
the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.416
because they're the ones who try the most.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.416
Take classical composers,
the best of the best.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.576
Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.976
and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.296
One of the best predictors

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.120
is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.336
The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.096
and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.456
Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart --

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.496
had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.760
to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.376
Now, you may be wondering,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.880
how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.480
I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.376
But for most of us,
if we want to be more original,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.720
we have to generate more ideas.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.136
The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.656
they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.136
to build a retail brand,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.616
and they tested over 2,000 possibilities

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.296
before they finally put together

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.720
Warby and Parker.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.016
So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.080
are not that different
from the rest of us.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.856
They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.896
They have bad ideas.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.256
And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.520
that they succeed.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.096
So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.376
Don't write them off.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.376
And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.856
Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.496
can boost your creativity,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.056
that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.656
and embracing the fear of failing to try,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.240
and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.336
Look, being original is not easy,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.296
but I have no doubt about this:

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.136
it's the best way
to improve the world around us.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.376
Thank you.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.640
(Applause)
