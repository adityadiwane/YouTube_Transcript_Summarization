00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So my name is Taylor Wilson.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I am 17 years old

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and I am a nuclear physicist,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And I would like to make the case

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that nuclear fusion

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
will be that point,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
will get us to.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And the second point,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
making the case that kids can really change the world.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So you may ask --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
(Applause)

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
You may ask me,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
well how do you know what our energy future is?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Well I built a fusion reactor

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
when I was 14 years old.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I started building this project

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I decided I wanted to make a star.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Now most of you are probably saying,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Well it doesn't break even.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
but it still does some pretty cool stuff.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And I assembled this in my garage,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and it now lives in the physics department

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
of the University of Nevada, Reno.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And it slams together deuterium,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So this is similar to the reaction

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I'm slamming it together so hard

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that that hydrogen fuses together,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and in the process it has some byproducts,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and I utilize those byproducts.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So this previous year,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that Homeland Security has.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
For hundreds of dollars,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I built this in my garage.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Applause)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And I've developed a system

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to produce medical isotopes.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I've developed a device that, on a very small scale,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
can produce these isotopes.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
That is me at the control panel

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
of my fusion reactor.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So maybe I don't want to admit to that.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And this is me with President Obama,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
showing him my Homeland Security research.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260
(Applause)

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So in about seven years

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
of doing nuclear research,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I started out with a dream

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and I ended up meeting the president

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and developing things that I think can change the world,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and I think other kids can too.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So thank you very much.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:26.260
(Applause)
