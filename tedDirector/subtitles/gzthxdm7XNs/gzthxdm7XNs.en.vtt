Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:16.315
Something happened in the early morning hours

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:19.900
of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.206
on the way our society operates.

00:00:22.206 --> 00:00:25.484
Ironically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:28.144
The change was silent, imperceptible,

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:30.989
unless you knew exactly what to look for.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.340
On that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.612
ordered that a special switch be thrown

00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:39.045
in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.909
Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.471
around the globe went from errors the size of a football field

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:51.406
to errors the size of a small room.

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:58.105
It's hard to overstate the effect that this change

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:00.657
in accuracy has had on us.

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:02.904
Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have

00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:05.163
in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn

00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:07.755
directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.449
what block you were on, let alone what street.

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.697
For geolocation, accuracy matters,

00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:16.955
and things have only improved over the last 10 years.

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:19.074
With more base stations, more ground stations,

00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:22.043
better receivers and better algorithms,

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:25.106
GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:29.608
but what part of the street.

00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:31.854
This level of accuracy

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:34.780
has unleashed a firestorm of innovation.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.451
In fact, many of you navigated here today

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:41.044
with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:44.269
Paper maps are becoming obsolete.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:48.408
But we now stand on the verge of another revolution

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.403
in geolocation accuracy.

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:53.136
What if I told you that the two-meter positioning

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:56.567
that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:00.464
is pathetic compared to what we could be getting?

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:03.297
For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention

00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:05.832
to the carrier phase of the GPS signal,

00:02:05.832 --> 00:02:08.313
and if you have an Internet connection,

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:11.129
then you can go from meter level to centimeter level,

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.096
even millimeter-level positioning.

00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:17.376
So why don't we have this capability on our phones?

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:21.746
Only, I believe, for a lack of imagination.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:24.913
Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:27.019
into their cheap GPS chips

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.173
because they're not sure what the general public would do

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:32.749
with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.587
the wrinkles in the palm of your hand.

00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:38.974
But you and I and other innovators,

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:43.014
we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:45.726
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:49.263
that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:51.271
on top of the physical world.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.158
I could build for you a structure up here in 3D,

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:56.526
millimeter accurate, that only you could see,

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:59.419
or my friends at home.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.934
So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:07.858
and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,

00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:12.841
that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:16.065
will become cheap and ubiquitous,

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.610
and the consequences will be fantastic.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.266
The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.946
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"

00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:29.394
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,

00:03:29.394 --> 00:03:32.771
which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device

00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:35.832
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.738
but we know that in the world of nonfiction,

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:41.602
the GPS dot is impossible, right?

00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:44.226
For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:47.410
and for another, they don't make devices quite this small,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.738
especially when those devices have to relay

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:52.713
their measurements back over a network.

00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:55.051
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.065
a few years ago, but things have changed.

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:00.921
There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:04.640
better sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.344
a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:09.520
to the left of the keys.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.171
Compare that with the device released just months ago

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.963
that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:18.516
and if you take a look at the state of the art

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:21.262
for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:23.349
on a side and more sensitive than ever,

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.858
you realize that the GPS dot will soon move

00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:31.257
from fiction to nonfiction.

00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:35.499
Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.405
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:42.976
anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:46.757
You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on

00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:50.724
everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.196
I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,

00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:56.564
and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.

00:04:56.564 --> 00:05:00.356
But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:02.967
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:05.106
(Laughter)

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:08.614
Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail,

00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:11.492
remember how refreshing it was to go from

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:15.636
organizing all of your email to simply searching it.

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:20.138
The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.

00:05:20.138 --> 00:05:24.824
Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.213
I was in my office some months back

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:29.756
and got a telephone call.

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:33.377
The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,

00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:35.456
was panicked.

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:38.249
Apparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:41.564
had found her in Texas and was following her around.

00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:45.401
So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.800
Well, so did I.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.791
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.525
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up,

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:57.875
at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.571
he was carrying an open laptop,

00:06:00.571 --> 00:06:03.414
and over time Carol realized that he had planted

00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.962
a GPS tracking device on her car,

00:06:05.962 --> 00:06:08.871
so she was calling me for help to disable it.

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.859
"Well, you should go to a good mechanic

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:14.143
and have him look at your car," I said.

00:06:14.143 --> 00:06:16.847
"I already have," she told me.

00:06:16.847 --> 00:06:18.991
"He didn't see anything obvious,

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:22.528
and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:25.849
"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.953
"I already have," she replied.

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:31.399
"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.152
and they're not set up technically to find the device."

00:06:35.152 --> 00:06:36.658
"Okay, what about the FBI?"

00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:40.821
"I've talked to them too, and same story."

00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:42.491
We then talked about her coming to my lab

00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:45.039
and us performing a radio sweep of her car,

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.538
but I wasn't even sure that would work,

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:49.589
given that some of these devices are configured

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:51.823
to only transmit when they're inside safe zones

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:55.127
or when the car is moving.

00:06:55.127 --> 00:06:56.621
So, there we were.

00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:59.590
Carol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.525
to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:10.410
worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.213
In fact, as I looked into her case,

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:15.675
I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:20.108
for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.

00:07:20.108 --> 00:07:23.988
The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:28.320
has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.836
but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:34.466
so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:37.737
but Big Neighbor. (Laughter)

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:42.385
There is one alternative that Carol could have taken,

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:48.088
very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.

00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:51.023
It's an open-source GPS jammer,

00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:53.578
developed by Limor Fried,

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:57.371
a graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it

00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:01.256
"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:03.521
With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you

00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:05.768
within which GPS signals can't reside.

00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:08.124
They get drowned out by the bubble.

00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:11.771
And Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,

00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.417
she felt threatened by GPS tracking.

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.993
Then she posted her design to the web,

00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:20.735
and if you don't have time to build your own,

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:21.509
you can buy one.

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.567
Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:27.340
of nearly identical devices on the Internet.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.492
So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:35.145
I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.

00:08:35.145 --> 00:08:38.927
But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal

00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:40.726
in the United States.

00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:41.473
And why is that?

00:08:41.473 --> 00:08:44.566
Well, because it's not a bubble at all.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.965
Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge

00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:49.437
of your personal space or at the edge of your car.

00:08:49.437 --> 00:08:55.673
They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)

00:08:55.673 --> 00:08:58.424
Now, if you're Carol or Limor,

00:08:58.424 --> 00:09:01.049
or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:04.824
it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,

00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:08.804
but in fact, the results can be disastrous.

00:09:08.804 --> 00:09:11.524
Imagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.043
trying to make your way through a thick fog

00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:17.883
and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.

00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:20.598
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,

00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:23.884
and now it's just you and the fog

00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:26.484
and whatever you can pull off the radar system

00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:29.608
if you remember how to work it.

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:35.544
They -- in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses

00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:40.197
anymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,

00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:42.617
was discontinued last year.

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:47.530
Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.800
We're almost blindly reliant on it.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.451
It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.

00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:57.079
Some call it "the invisible utility."

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:00.801
So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:05.171
It might be deadly.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:09.379
But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:12.868
at the expense of general GPS reliability,

00:10:12.868 --> 00:10:15.028
there's something even more potent

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:18.820
and more subversive than a Wave Bubble,

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.209
and that is a GPS spoofer.

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:25.034
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.

00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:29.011
Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.

00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:32.129
You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:35.296
you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:36.928
So let me show you how this works.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.653
In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:42.288
that corresponds to the authentic signals.

00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:45.103
These three red dots represent the tracking points

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.982
that try to keep themselves centered on that peak.

00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:51.047
But if you send in a fake GPS signal,

00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:55.513
another peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks

00:10:55.513 --> 00:11:00.231
perfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,

00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:03.542
and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:07.502
with the authentic peak getting forced off.

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.669
At this point, the game is over.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.406
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.901
So is this really possible?

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.624
Can someone really manipulate

00:11:16.624 --> 00:11:18.606
the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:21.485
just like that, with a spoofer?

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:23.500
Well, the short answer is yes.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.304
The key is that civil GPS signals

00:11:26.304 --> 00:11:27.406
are completely open.

00:11:27.406 --> 00:11:31.397
They have no encryption. They have no authentication.

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:34.892
They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.

00:11:34.892 --> 00:11:37.467
Even so, up until very recently,

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:39.859
nobody worried about GPS spoofers.

00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:41.837
People figured that it would be too complex

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:44.652
or too expensive for some hacker to build one.

00:11:44.652 --> 00:11:48.604
But I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,

00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:50.756
we didn't see it that way.

00:11:50.756 --> 00:11:53.229
We knew it wasn't going to be so hard,

00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:55.157
and we wanted to be the first to build one

00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:57.237
so we could get out in front of the problem

00:11:57.237 --> 00:12:01.343
and help protect against GPS spoofing.

00:12:01.343 --> 00:12:04.688
I remember vividly the week it all came together.

00:12:04.688 --> 00:12:08.137
We built it at my home, which means that

00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:12.526
I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.

00:12:12.526 --> 00:12:14.944
Here's Ramon — (Laughter) —

00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:18.629
looking for a little attention from Dad that week.

00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:20.899
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:23.781
and computers, though we eventually got it packaged

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:25.453
into a small box.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.262
Now, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:30.989
when the spoofer finally came alive

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:33.590
and I glimpsed its awful potential,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.326
came late one night when I tested the spoofer

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.412
against my iPhone.

00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:40.029
Let me show you some actual footage from that

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:41.965
very first experiment.

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:45.559
I had come to completely trust this little blue dot

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:47.194
and its reassuring blue halo.

00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:48.269
They seemed to speak to me.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:52.929
They'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)

00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:55.799
And "you can trust us."

00:12:55.799 --> 00:13:00.917
So something felt very wrong about the world.

00:13:00.917 --> 00:13:03.500
It was a sense, almost, of betrayal,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.691
when this little blue dot started at my house,

00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.303
and went running off toward the north

00:13:09.303 --> 00:13:13.198
leaving me behind. I wasn't moving.

00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:17.431
What I then saw in this little moving blue dot

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:20.149
was the potential for chaos.

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:24.291
I saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain

00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:28.565
learning only too late that something was wrong.

00:13:28.565 --> 00:13:31.065
I saw the GPS-derived timing

00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:32.796
of the New York Stock Exchange

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:34.746
being manipulated by hackers.

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:37.714
You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc

00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:40.364
you could cause if you knew what you were doing

00:13:40.364 --> 00:13:43.717
with a GPS spoofer.

00:13:43.717 --> 00:13:48.861
There is, though, one redeeming feature

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:51.317
of the GPS spoofer.

00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:55.918
It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:59.005
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.529
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool,

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:04.490
pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.205
Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend

00:14:07.205 --> 00:14:08.522
into some empty parking lot

00:14:08.522 --> 00:14:10.823
where the police are waiting for him.

00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:16.026
So I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,

00:14:16.026 --> 00:14:18.691
between privacy on the one hand

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.890
and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.935
We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,

00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:29.671
and yet, given the lack of effective legal means

00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:33.770
for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.642
can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,

00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:38.058
for wanting to use them?

00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:41.111
I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile

00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:44.297
this conflict with some sort of,

00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:49.727
some yet uninvented technology.

00:14:49.727 --> 00:14:52.853
But meanwhile, grab some popcorn,

00:14:52.853 --> 00:14:54.980
because things are going to get interesting.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.320
Within the next few years,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.574
many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.

00:15:00.574 --> 00:15:02.922
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.

00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:06.374
You'll never lose track of your things again.

00:15:06.374 --> 00:15:10.403
The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.

00:15:10.403 --> 00:15:13.085
But will you be able to resist the temptation

00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:16.077
to track your fellow man?

00:15:16.077 --> 00:15:17.909
Or will you be able to resist the temptation

00:15:17.909 --> 00:15:21.204
to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble

00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:23.972
to protect your own privacy?

00:15:23.972 --> 00:15:27.604
So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon

00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:30.944
is full of promise and peril.

00:15:30.944 --> 00:15:34.132
It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.

00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:36.766
Thanks. (Applause)
