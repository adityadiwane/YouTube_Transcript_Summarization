00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:29.330
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.719
is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.608
And the object that was levitating here

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:41.609
is called a superconductor.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.201
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:51.458
and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:53.804
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.570
it was discovered 100 years ago.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.696
However, only recently,

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:00.058
due to several technological advancements,

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:02.730
we are now able to demonstrate to you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.476
quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:12.321
So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.

00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.777
The first is zero electrical resistance,

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:22.666
and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.561
That sounds complicated, right?

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.433
But what is electrical resistance?

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:34.682
So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:38.031
And these electrons, while flowing,

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.719
they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.935
they lose a certain amount of energy.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:48.536
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:54.455
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:59.147
so there is no energy dissipation.

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:02.128
It's quite remarkable. Think about it.

00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:07.207
In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.

00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:11.245
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:19.962
But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:24.279
So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:30.402
and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:33.392
Now, the combination of both effects --

00:02:33.392 --> 00:02:39.392
the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.560
is exactly a superconductor.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.776
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:54.161
and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.

00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.815
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:02.905
these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:09.162
And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:12.007
they come in discrete quantities.

00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:15.653
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:19.503
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.

00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:25.082
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.

00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:28.975
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:33.270
but they behave like particles.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.464
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:43.527
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?

00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:48.112
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,

00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:52.232
but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.680
because their movements dissipate energy,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.626
which breaks the superconductivity state.

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:02.984
So what it actually does, it locks these strands,

00:04:02.984 --> 00:04:08.736
which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:15.024
And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:24.240
Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.047
will change their configuration.

00:04:26.047 --> 00:04:31.344
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.

00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:37.104
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:41.568
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:45.440
it just stays locked in midair.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.505
(Applause)

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.551
Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.

00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:58.672
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.

00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:02.696
Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:10.447
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.

00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:12.607
Of course, I can turn it upside down,

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:15.513
and it will remain locked.

00:05:15.513 --> 00:05:24.735
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,

00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:29.049
Yeah, we understand that.

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:33.311
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.279
in which the magnetic field is the same all around,

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.215
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:49.239
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:55.265
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.

00:05:55.265 --> 00:06:01.927
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:11.207
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:17.703
But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?

00:06:17.703 --> 00:06:20.584
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.

00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:27.952
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.

00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:32.056
But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:37.672
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here

00:06:37.672 --> 00:06:45.197
is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.

00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:54.759
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:00.592
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:04.169
Now, I can extend this circular magnet,

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.950
and make whatever track I want.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.879
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:19.762
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,

00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:23.871
it moves freely.

00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:33.252
(Applause)

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:37.993
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,

00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:44.434
and it freely moves in this new position.

00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:48.872
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.

00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:54.816
I can take this disk and put it here,

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:57.800
and while it stays here -- don't move --

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.358
I will try to rotate the track,

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:06.657
and hopefully, if I did it correctly,

00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:08.800
it stays suspended.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:18.249
(Applause)

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:25.090
You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.225
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:32.928
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:38.474
Now -- (Laughter) --

00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:45.497
So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,

00:08:45.497 --> 00:08:50.720
so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.906
such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.

00:08:55.906 --> 00:09:00.466
But we can also store energy using superconductors,

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:02.355
because we have no dissipation.

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:09.537
And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.

00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:18.543
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.

00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:23.019
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:30.158
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:36.571
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,

00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.450
three-inch diameter, with a single difference.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.635
The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:48.723
being two millimeters thin, quite thin.

00:09:48.723 --> 00:09:59.458
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:02.754
Amazing. Thank you.

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:17.834
(Applause)
