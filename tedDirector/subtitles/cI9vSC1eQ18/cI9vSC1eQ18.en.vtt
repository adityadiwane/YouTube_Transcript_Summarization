00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.590
So in 1781, an English composer,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.729
technologist and astronomer called William Herschel

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:21.472
noticed an object on the sky that

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:24.340
didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.434
And Herschel's recognition
that something was different,

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:29.301
that something wasn't quite right,

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.123
was the discovery of a planet,

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:33.200
the planet Uranus,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.555
a name that has entertained

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.715
countless generations of children,

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.050
but a planet that overnight

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.666
doubled the size of our known solar system.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.521
Just last month, NASA announced the discovery

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.850
of 517 new planets

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.976
in orbit around nearby stars,

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:51.227
almost doubling overnight the number of planets

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:53.825
we know about within our galaxy.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.457
So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:58.595
capacity to collect data,

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:01.140
and with data almost doubling every year,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.948
within the next two decades, me may even

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:05.266
reach the point for the first time in history

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.120
where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.844
within the universe.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:12.128
But as we enter this era of big data,

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:14.108
what we're beginning to find is there's a difference

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:17.269
between more data being just better

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:19.249
and more data being different,

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.140
capable of changing the questions we want to ask,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460
and this difference is not about
how much data we collect,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.149
it's whether those data open new windows

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.527
into our universe,

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:31.412
whether they change the way we view the sky.

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:34.851
So what is the next window into our universe?

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.642
What is the next chapter for astronomy?

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:40.297
Well, I'm going to show you some
of the tools and the technologies

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:42.861
that we're going to develop over the next decade,

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:44.334
and how these technologies,

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:46.202
together with the smart use of data,

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:49.172
may once again transform astronomy

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:51.219
by opening up a window into our universe,

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.000
the window of time.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.584
Why time? Well, time is about origins,

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:57.474
and it's about evolution.

00:01:57.474 --> 00:01:58.970
The origins of our solar system,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.174
how our solar system came into being,

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:04.583
is it unusual or special in any way?

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.574
About the evolution of our universe.

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:09.580
Why our universe is continuing to expand,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.513
and what is this mysterious dark energy

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:14.128
that drives that expansion?

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:16.892
But first, I want to show you how technology

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:19.663
is going to change the way we view the sky.

00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:21.170
So imagine if you were sitting

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.262
in the mountains of northern Chile

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:24.669
looking out to the west

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.717
towards the Pacific Ocean

00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:29.281
a few hours before sunrise.

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.518
This is the view of the night sky that you would see,

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.189
and it's a beautiful view,

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.102
with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:39.262
but it's also a static view,

00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:42.020
and in many ways, this is the
way we think of our universe:

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.414
eternal and unchanging.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.405
But the universe is anything but static.

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:48.936
It constantly changes on timescales of seconds

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.781
to billions of years.

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.525
Galaxies merge, they collide

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:55.180
at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.250
Stars are born, they die,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.400
they explode in these extravagant displays.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.670
In fact, if we could go back

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.269
to our tranquil skies above Chile,

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.734
and we allow time to move forward

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:11.127
to see how the sky might change over the next year,

00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:13.417
the pulsations that you see

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:17.826
are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:21.573
exploding, brightening and then fading from view,

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.463
each one of these supernovae

00:03:23.463 --> 00:03:26.466
five billion times the brightness of our sun,

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.806
so we can see them to great distances

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:31.302
but only for a short amount of time.

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:33.879
Ten supernova per second explode somewhere

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.296
in our universe.

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:36.716
If we could hear it,

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:40.415
it would be popping like a bag of popcorn.

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:43.542
Now, if we fade out the supernovae,

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.771
it's not just brightness that changes.

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.110
Our sky is in constant motion.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.280
This swarm of objects you
see streaming across the sky

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.938
are asteroids as they orbit our sun,

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:56.910
and it's these changes and the motion

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.234
and it's the dynamics of the system

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:01.607
that allow us to build our models for our universe,

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:05.680
to predict its future and to explain its past.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.774
But the telescopes we've used over the last decade

00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:12.789
are not designed to capture the data at this scale.

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.409
The Hubble Space Telescope:

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.670
for the last 25 years it's been producing

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.631
some of the most detailed views

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.622
of our distant universe,

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:22.692
but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:27.270
of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.982
about 120 years to do this just once.

00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:33.243
So this is driving us to new technologies

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:35.090
and new telescopes,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.832
telescopes that can go faint

00:04:36.832 --> 00:04:38.385
to look at the distant universe

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:41.066
but also telescopes that can go wide

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.885
to capture the sky as rapidly as possible,

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:47.446
telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:49.325
or the LSST,

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:51.665
possibly the most boring name ever

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.644
for one of the most fascinating experiments

00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:55.636
in the history of astronomy,

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:57.850
in fact proof, if you should need it,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.518
that you should never allow 
a scientist or an engineer

00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:06.349
to name anything, not even your children.
(Laughter)

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.814
We're building the LSST.

00:05:07.814 --> 00:05:11.195
We expect it to start taking data
by the end of this decade.

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:12.894
I'm going to show you how we think

00:05:12.894 --> 00:05:16.471
it's going to transform 
our views of the universe,

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:18.845
because one image from the LSST

00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:21.230
is equivalent to 3,000 images

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.356
from the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:26.494
each image three and a half degrees on the sky,

00:05:26.494 --> 00:05:29.270
seven times the width of the full moon.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.579
Well, how do you capture an image at this scale?

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:35.730
Well, you build the largest digital camera in history,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.891
using the same technology you find
in the cameras in your cell phone

00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:42.682
or in the digital cameras you 
can buy in the High Street,

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:45.802
but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,

00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:48.210
about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.168
where one image is three billion pixels.

00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:52.506
So if you wanted to look at an image

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:55.735
in its full resolution, just a single LSST image,

00:05:55.735 --> 00:06:00.460
it would take about 1,500 
high-definition TV screens.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.238
And this camera will image the sky,

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.276
taking a new picture every 20 seconds,

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:08.464
constantly scanning the sky

00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:11.289
so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.672
of the skies above Chile.

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:16.507
Over the mission lifetime of this telescope,

00:06:16.507 --> 00:06:19.859
it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:21.359
and that will be for the first time

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:24.134
we'll have detected more objects in our universe

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.823
than people on the Earth.

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.038
Now, we can talk about this

00:06:28.038 --> 00:06:30.400
in terms of terabytes and petabytes

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.919
and billions of objects,

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.667
but a way to get a sense of the amount of data

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.566
that will come off this camera

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:40.297
is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded

00:06:40.297 --> 00:06:43.370
simultaneously, 24 hours a day,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.228
seven days a week, for 10 years.

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:48.489
And to process this data means

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.413
searching through all of those talks

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.662
for every new idea and every new concept,

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.518
looking at each part of the video

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:56.543
to see how one frame may have changed

00:06:56.543 --> 00:06:58.388
from the next.

00:06:58.388 --> 00:07:00.739
And this is changing the way that we do science,

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:02.994
changing the way that we do astronomy,

00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:05.250
to a place where software and algorithms

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.118
have to mine through this data,

00:07:07.118 --> 00:07:10.324
where the software is as critical to the science

00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:14.351
as the telescopes and the 
cameras that we've built.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.938
Now, thousands of discoveries

00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:18.873
will come from this project,

00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.324
but I'm just going to tell you about two

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:22.687
of the ideas about origins and evolution

00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:24.940
that may be transformed by our access

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.501
to data at this scale.

00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:29.886
In the last five years, NASA has discovered

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:32.147
over 1,000 planetary systems

00:07:32.147 --> 00:07:34.240
around nearby stars,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.170
but the systems we're finding

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.660
aren't much like our own solar system,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.235
and one of the questions we face is

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.553
is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:44.319
or is there something special or unusual

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.737
about how our solar system formed?

00:07:46.737 --> 00:07:48.999
And if we want to answer that question,

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.438
we have to know and understand

00:07:50.438 --> 00:07:53.274
the history of our solar system in detail,

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.411
and it's the details that are crucial.

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:59.077
So now, if we look back at the sky,

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:02.628
at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,

00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:06.850
these asteroids are like the
debris of our solar system.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.858
The positions of the asteroids

00:08:08.858 --> 00:08:10.995
are like a fingerprint of an earlier time

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:12.975
when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:14.870
were much closer to the sun,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.323
and as these giant planets migrated
through our solar system,

00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:21.653
they were scattering the asteroids in their wake.

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:22.959
So studying the asteroids

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:25.080
is like performing forensics,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.638
performing forensics on our solar system,

00:08:27.638 --> 00:08:30.340
but to do this, we need distance,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.419
and we get the distance from the motion,

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.966
and we get the motion because of our access to time.

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:38.668
So what does this tell us?

00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:40.895
Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.168
flitting across the screen,

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:45.598
these are the asteroids that are moving fastest,

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:48.939
because they're closest to us, closest to Earth.

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:50.446
These are the asteroids we may one day

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.844
send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,

00:08:53.844 --> 00:08:55.846
but they're also the asteroids that may one day

00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:57.511
impact the Earth,

00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.802
like happened 60 million years ago

00:08:58.802 --> 00:09:01.437
with the extinction of the dinosaurs,

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:03.259
or just at the beginning of the last century,

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.591
when an asteroid wiped out

00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:08.180
almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.268
or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:14.880
releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.502
So studying the forensics of our solar system

00:09:18.502 --> 00:09:20.560
doesn't just tell us about the past,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.371
it can also predict the future, 
including our future.

00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:28.739
Now when we get distance,

00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:32.328
we get to see the asteroids 
in their natural habitat,

00:09:32.328 --> 00:09:33.650
in orbit around the sun.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.557
So every point in this visualization that you can see

00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:39.320
is a real asteroid.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.330
Its orbit has been calculated
from its motion across the sky.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.671
The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:48.808
dry and stony in the center,

00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:51.395
water-rich and primitive towards the edge,

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:53.679
water-rich asteroids which may have seeded

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:57.130
the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.336
when they bombarded the 
Earth at an earlier time.

00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:04.959
Because the LSST will be able to go faint

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.657
and not just wide,

00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:08.465
we will be able to see these asteroids

00:10:08.465 --> 00:10:11.652
far beyond the inner part of our solar system,

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:15.465
to asteroids beyond the 
orbits of Neptune and Mars,

00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:17.726
to comets and asteroids that may exist

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:20.956
almost a light year from our sun.

00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:23.565
And as we increase the detail of this picture,

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:26.692
increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:29.122
we will be able to answer questions such as,

00:10:29.122 --> 00:10:32.711
is there evidence for planets
outside the orbit of Neptune,

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:35.218
to find Earth-impacting asteroids

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.753
long before they're a danger,

00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:39.510
and to find out whether, maybe,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.690
our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.772
and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings

00:10:45.772 --> 00:10:49.214
that influenced the formation of our solar system,

00:10:49.214 --> 00:10:54.967
and maybe that's one of the reasons why 
solar systems like ours seem to be so rare.

00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:59.536
Now, distance and changes in our universe —

00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:03.395
distance equates to time,

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:05.454
as well as changes on the sky.

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:08.244
Every foot of distance you look away,

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:10.729
or every foot of distance an object is away,

00:11:10.729 --> 00:11:14.318
you're looking back about a
billionth of a second in time,

00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:16.931
and this idea or this notion of looking back in time

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:19.562
has revolutionized our ideas about the universe,

00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:21.842
not once but multiple times.

00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:24.654
The first time was in 1929,

00:11:24.654 --> 00:11:26.746
when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble

00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:28.995
showed that the universe was expanding,

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:31.708
leading to the ideas of the Big Bang.

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.290
And the observations were simple:

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.444
just 24 galaxies

00:11:36.444 --> 00:11:39.494
and a hand-drawn picture.

00:11:41.124 --> 00:11:45.784
But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,

00:11:45.784 --> 00:11:47.854
the faster it was receding,

00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:51.273
was enough to give rise to modern cosmology.

00:11:51.273 --> 00:11:53.698
A second revolution happened 70 years later,

00:11:53.698 --> 00:11:55.770
when two groups of astronomers showed

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.203
that the universe wasn't just expanding,

00:11:58.203 --> 00:11:59.528
it was accelerating,

00:11:59.528 --> 00:12:02.871
a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:05.683
and finding out the higher that it gets,

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.461
the faster it moves away.

00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:08.970
And they showed this

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.375
by measuring the brightness of supernovae,

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:13.209
and how the brightness of the supernovae

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:15.380
got fainter with distance.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.833
And these observations were more complex.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:20.847
They required new technologies and new telescopes,

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:24.897
because the supernovae were in galaxies

00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:26.855
that were 2,000 times more distant

00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:29.543
than the ones used by Hubble.

00:12:29.543 --> 00:12:34.854
And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:36.608
because a supernova only explodes

00:12:36.608 --> 00:12:39.690
once every hundred years within a galaxy.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.974
Three years to find 42 supernovae

00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:45.993
by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.

00:12:45.993 --> 00:12:47.844
And once they'd collected their data,

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:51.592
this is what they found.

00:12:51.592 --> 00:12:54.303
Now, this may not look impressive,

00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:58.418
but this is what a revolution in physics looks like:

00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:00.848
a line predicting the brightness of a supernova

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.894
11 billion light years away,

00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:06.690
and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.803
Small changes give rise to big consequences.

00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:13.751
Small changes allow us to make discoveries,

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.574
like the planet found by Herschel.

00:13:16.574 --> 00:13:18.846
Small changes turn our understanding

00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:21.247
of the universe on its head.

00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:24.711
So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,

00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:26.720
meaning slightly further away,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.880
requiring that a universe must not just be expanding,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.210
but this expansion must be accelerating,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.156
revealing a component of our universe

00:13:35.156 --> 00:13:37.642
which we now call dark energy,

00:13:37.642 --> 00:13:40.151
a component that drives this expansion

00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.178
and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget

00:13:43.178 --> 00:13:45.213
of our universe today.

00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:50.575
So what is the next revolution likely to be?

00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:53.294
Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist?

00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:55.622
Each of these lines shows a different model

00:13:55.622 --> 00:13:58.465
for what dark energy might be,

00:13:58.465 --> 00:14:00.946
showing the properties of dark energy.

00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:04.569
They all are consistent with the 42 points,

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:06.796
but the ideas behind these lines

00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:08.899
are dramatically different.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:11.442
Some people think about a dark energy

00:14:11.442 --> 00:14:12.900
that changes with time,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.188
or whether the properties of the dark energy

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.944
are different depending on where you look on the sky.

00:14:17.944 --> 00:14:19.767
Others make differences and changes

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:22.815
to the physics at the sub-atomic level.

00:14:22.815 --> 00:14:25.605
Or, they look at large scales

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:29.170
and change how gravity and general relativity work,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.961
or they say our universe is just one of many,

00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:34.559
part of this mysterious multiverse,

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:37.720
but all of these ideas, all of these theories,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.219
amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,

00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:45.246
but all of them consistent with our 42 points.

00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:47.428
So how can we hope to make sense of this

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.700
over the next decade?

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.930
Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.929
and I said you wanted to see whether those dice

00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:56.796
were loaded or fair.

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:59.730
One roll of the dice would tell you very little,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.722
but the more times you rolled them,

00:15:01.722 --> 00:15:03.644
the more data you collected,

00:15:03.644 --> 00:15:05.816
the more confident you would become,

00:15:05.816 --> 00:15:08.419
not just whether they're loaded or fair,

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:12.317
but by how much, and in what way.

00:15:12.317 --> 00:15:16.119
It took three years to find just 42 supernovae

00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:19.166
because the telescopes that we built

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.859
could only survey a small part of the sky.

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:25.524
With the LSST, we get a completely new view

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:29.146
of the skies above Chile every three nights.

00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:31.609
In its first night of operation,

00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:34.759
it will find 10 times the number of supernovae

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:37.900
used in the discovery of dark energy.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.709
This will increase by 1,000

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:42.202
within the first four months:

00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:46.986
1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,

00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:50.171
each supernova a roll of the dice,

00:15:50.171 --> 00:15:53.613
each supernova testing which theories of dark energy

00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:57.741
are consistent, and which ones are not.

00:15:57.741 --> 00:16:01.544
And so, by combining these supernova data

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.820
with other measures of cosmology,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.710
we'll progressively rule out the different ideas

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.686
and theories of dark energy

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:15.828
until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,

00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:18.442
we would expect to hopefully see

00:16:18.442 --> 00:16:20.584
a theory for our universe,

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:23.123
a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,

00:16:23.123 --> 00:16:25.880
to gradually emerge.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.342
Now, in many ways, the questions that I posed

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:33.703
are in reality the simplest of questions.

00:16:33.703 --> 00:16:35.457
We may not know the answers,

00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:39.309
but we at least know how to ask the questions.

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:42.427
But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies

00:16:42.427 --> 00:16:45.365
revealed 42 supernovae that turned

00:16:45.365 --> 00:16:48.844
our understanding of the universe on its head,

00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:51.758
when we're working with billions of galaxies,

00:16:51.758 --> 00:16:53.535
how many more times are we going to find

00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:59.183
42 points that don't quite match what we expect?

00:16:59.183 --> 00:17:01.940
Like the planet found by Herschel

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.357
or dark energy

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:08.200
or quantum mechanics or general relativity,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.544
all ideas that came because the data

00:17:10.544 --> 00:17:13.999
didn't quite match what we expected.

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:17.260
What's so exciting about the next decade of data

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.930
in astronomy is,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.141
we don't even know how many answers

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:22.941
are out there waiting,

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.822
answers about our origins and our evolution.

00:17:26.822 --> 00:17:27.917
How many answers are out there

00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:31.211
that we don't even know the questions

00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:33.222
that we want to ask?

00:17:33.222 --> 00:17:35.169
Thank you.

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:38.871
(Applause)
