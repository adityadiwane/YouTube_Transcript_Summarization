00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.116
When I was a kid, I was obsessed
with the Guinness Book of World Records,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.596
and I really wanted
to set a world record myself.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.316
But there was just one small problem:

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.500
I had absolutely no talent.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.756
So I decided to set
a world record in something

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.660
that demanded absolutely no skill at all.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.396
I decided to set a world record

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.620
in crawling.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.476
(Laughter)

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.020
Now, the record at the time
was 12 and a half miles,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.836
and for some reason,
this seemed totally manageable.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.020
(Laughter)

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.956
I recruited my friend Anne,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.556
and together we decided,
we didn't even need to train.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.836
(Laughter)

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.676
And on the day of our record attempt,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.356
we put furniture pads
on the outside of our good luck jeans

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.780
and we set off,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.596
and right away, we were in trouble,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.716
because the denim was against our skin

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.315
and it began to chafe,

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.980
and soon our knees were being chewed up.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.940
Hours in,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
it began to rain.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.780
Then, Anne dropped out.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.180
Then, it got dark.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.316
Now, by now, my knees
were bleeding through my jeans,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.556
and I was hallucinating from the cold

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.276
and the pain and the monotony.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.820
And to give you an idea
of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.060
the first lap around
the high school track took 10 minutes.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.500
The last lap took almost 30.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.236
After 12 hours of crawling,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.596
I stopped,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.500
and I had gone eight and a half miles.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.356
So I was short of
the 12-and-a-half-mile record.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.916
Now, for many years, I thought
this was a story of abject failure,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.436
but today I see it differently,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.316
because when I was
attempting the world record,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.836
I was doing three things.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.196
I was getting outside my comfort zone,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.476
I was calling upon my resilience,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.236
and I was finding confidence in myself

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.660
and my own decisions.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.516
I didn't know it then,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.460
but those are not
the attributes of failure.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900
Those are the attributes of bravery.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.676
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.940
I became a San Francisco firefighter,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.796
and I was the 15th woman
in a department of 1,500 men.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.580
(Applause)

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.916
And as you can imagine, when I arrived

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.636
there were many doubts
about whether we could do the job.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.996
So even though I was a 5'10",
150-pound collegiate rower,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.396
and someone who could endure
12 hours of searing knee pain --

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.036
(Laughter)

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.076
I knew I still had to prove
my strength and fitness.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.916
So one day a call came in for a fire,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.179
and sure enough,
when my engine group pulled up,

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:20.236
there was black smoke billowing
from a building off an alleyway.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.476
And I was with a big guy named Skip,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.236
and he was on the nozzle,
and I was right behind,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.076
and it was a typical sort of fire.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.980
It was smoky, it was hot,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.196
and all of a sudden,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.996
there was an explosion,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.196
and Skip and I were blown backwards,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.356
my mask was knocked sideways,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.636
and there was this moment of confusion.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.076
And then I picked myself up,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.916
I groped for the nozzle,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.436
and I did what a firefighter
was supposed to do:

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.196
I lunged forward,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.676
opened up the water

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.580
and I tackled the fire myself.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.796
The explosion had been caused
by a water heater,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.516
so nobody was hurt,
and ultimately it was not a big deal,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.796
but later Skip came up to me and said,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.556
"Nice job, Caroline,"

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.876
in this surprised sort of voice.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.500
(Laughter)

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.236
And I was confused, because
the fire hadn't been difficult physically,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.580
so why was he looking at me
with something like astonishment?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.956
And then it became clear:

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.116
Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.356
and an excellent firefighter,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.755
not only thought
that women could not be strong,

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.820
he thought that they
could not be brave either.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.180
And he wasn't the only one.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.636
Friends, acquaintances and strangers,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.716
men and women throughout my career

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.196
ask me over and over,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.156
"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.420
aren't you scared?"

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.020
Honestly, I never heard
a male firefighter asked this.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.260
And I became curious.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.180
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.356
Now, the answer began to come

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.116
when a friend of mine lamented to me

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.596
that her young daughter
was a big scaredy-cat,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.556
and so I began to notice,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.276
and yes, the daughter was anxious,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.060
but more than that,
the parents were anxious.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.196
Most of what they said to her
when she was outside began with,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.820
"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No."

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.396
Now, my friends were not bad parents.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.116
They were just doing what most parents do,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.140
which is cautioning their daughters
much more than they caution their sons.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.340
There was a study involving
a playground fire pole, ironically,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.396
in which researchers saw that little girls
were very likely to be warned

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.116
by both their moms and dads
about the fire pole's risk,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.596
and if the little girls
still wanted to play on the fire pole,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.340
a parent was very likely to assist her.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.380
But the little boys?

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.756
They were encouraged
to play on the fire pole

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.716
despite any trepidations
that they might have,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.860
and often the parents offered
guidance on how to use it on their own.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.260
So what message does this send
to both boys and girls?

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.676
Well, that girls are fragile
and more in need of help,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.740
and that boys can and should
master difficult tasks by themselves.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.076
It says that girls should be fearful

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.420
and boys should be gutsy.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.476
Now, the irony is that at this young age,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.996
girls and boys are actually
very alike physically.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.676
In fact, girls are often
stronger until puberty,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.940
and more mature.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.276
And yet we adults act

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.636
as if girls are more fragile

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.596
and more in need of help,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.300
and they can't handle as much.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.556
This is the message
that we absorb as kids,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.276
and this is the message
that fully permeates as we grow up.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.756
We women believe it, men believe it,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.316
and guess what?

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.676
As we become parents,
we pass it on to our children,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.020
and so it goes.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.036
Well, so now I had my answer.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.636
This is why women, even firewomen,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.756
were expected to be scared.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.860
This is why women often are scared.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.876
Now, I know some of you
won't believe me when I tell you this,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.380
but I am not against fear.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.836
I know it's an important emotion,
and it's there to keep us safe.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.036
But the problem is
when fear is the primary reaction

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.396
that we teach and encourage in girls

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.060
whenever they face something
outside their comfort zone.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.220
So I was a paraglider pilot
for many years --

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.516
(Applause)

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.956
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.716
and it does fly very well,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.636
but to many people I realize
it looks just like a bedsheet

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.156
with strings attached.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.356
(Laughter)

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.836
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.436
inflating this bedsheet,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.140
running off and flying.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.956
And I know what you're thinking.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.260
You're like, Caroline,
a little fear would make sense here.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.476
And you're right, it does.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.996
I assure you, I did feel fear.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.276
But on that mountaintop,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.356
waiting for the wind
to come in just right,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.596
I felt so many other things, too:

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.900
exhilaration, confidence.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.596
I knew I was a good pilot.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.636
I knew the conditions were good,
or I wouldn't be there.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.196
I knew how great it was going to be
a thousand feet in the air.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.836
So yes, fear was there,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.036
but I would take a good hard look at it,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.716
assess just how relevant it was

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.076
and then put it where it belonged,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.516
which was more often than not

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.516
behind my exhilaration, my anticipation

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.740
and my confidence.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.236
So I'm not against fear.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.780
I'm just pro-bravery.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.556
Now, I'm not saying
your girls must be firefighters

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.796
or that they should be paragliders,

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.580
but I am saying that we are raising
our girls to be timid, even helpless,

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.036
and it begins when we caution them
against physical risk.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.676
The fear we learn
and the experiences we don't

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.516
stay with us as we become women

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.796
and morphs into all those things
that we face and try to shed:

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.116
our hesitation in speaking out,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.796
our deference so that we can be liked

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.540
and our lack of confidence
in our own decisions.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.100
So how do we become brave?

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.036
Well, here's the good news.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.036
Bravery is learned,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.476
and like anything learned,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.340
it just needs to be practiced.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.436
So first,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.156
we have to take a deep breath

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.236
and encourage our girls

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.956
to skateboard, climb trees

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.540
and clamber around
on that playground fire pole.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.476
This is what my own mother did.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.276
She didn't know it then,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.596
but researchers have a name for this.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.716
They call it risky play,

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.196
and studies show that risky play
is really important for kids, all kids,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.796
because it teaches hazard assessment,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.996
it teaches delayed gratification,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.796
it teaches resilience,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.140
it teaches confidence.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.356
In other words,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.676
when kids get outside
and practice bravery,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.860
they learn valuable life lessons.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.156
Second, we have to stop
cautioning our girls willy-nilly.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.596
So notice next time you say,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.476
"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,"

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.580
or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous."

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.876
And remember that often
what you're really telling her

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.316
is that she shouldn't be pushing herself,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.516
that she's really not good enough,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.340
that she should be afraid.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.340
Third,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.900
we women have to start
practicing bravery, too.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.860
We cannot teach our girls
until we teach ourselves.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.676
So here's another thing:

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.796
fear and exhilaration

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.580
feel very similar --

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.156
the shaky hands,
the heightened heart rate,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.556
the nervous tension,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.316
and I'm betting that for many of you

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.156
the last time you thought
you were scared out of your wits,

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.116
you may have been feeling
mostly exhilaration,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.100
and now you've missed an opportunity.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.740
So practice.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.356
And while girls should be getting
outside to learn to be gutsy,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:18.476
I get that adults don't want
to get on hoverboards or climb trees,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.956
so we all should be practicing

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.196
at home, in the office

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.316
and even right here getting up the guts

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.700
to talk to someone that you really admire.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.196
Finally, when your girl is, let's say,

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.316
on her bike on the top of the steep hill

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.756
that she insists
she's too scared to go down,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.900
guide her to access her bravery.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.796
Ultimately, maybe that hill
really is too steep,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.740
but she'll come to that conclusion
through courage, not fear.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.636
Because this is not
about the steep hill in front of her.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.540
This is about the life ahead of her

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.996
and that she has the tools

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.116
to handle and assess

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.396
all the dangers
that we cannot protect her from,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.300
all the challenges that we won't
be there to guide her through,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.436
everything that our girls here

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.836
and around the world

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.660
face in their future.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.260
So by the way,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.996
the world record for crawling today --

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.396
(Laughter)

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.460
is 35.18 miles,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.796
and I would really love
to see a girl go break that.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:40.176
(Applause)
