00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Once upon a time,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
at the age of 24,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I was a guest student during one month

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
of a public health course.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And that changed my mindset forever.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
The course was good, but it was not the course content

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
in itself that changed the mindset.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
It was the brutal realization,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the first morning,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
that the Indian students were better than me.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.260
(Laughter)

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
You see, I was a study nerd.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I loved statistics from a young age.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And I studied very much in Sweden.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And the fact was that Indian students

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
studied harder than we did in Sweden.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
They read the textbook twice,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
or three times or four times.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
(Laugher)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And that, to me,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that personal experience

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
was the first time in my life

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that the mindset I grew up with

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
was changed.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And I realized that perhaps

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
the Western world will not continue

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
to dominate the world forever.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's that realization of someone you meet

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that really made you change your ideas about the world.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And I will now,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
here, onstage,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
try to predict when that will happen --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that Asia will regain

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
its dominant position

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
as the leading part of the world,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
as it used to be, over thousands of years.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And I will do that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
by trying to predict precisely

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
at what year

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
the average income per person

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
in India, in China, will reach that of the West.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And I don't mean the whole economy,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
because to grow an economy

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
of India to the size of U.K. --

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
for each person, per month,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
in India and China,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
But I will start with a historical background.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I will start at 1858.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
1858 was a year of great technological

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
advancement in the West.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
That was the year when Queen Victoria

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
was able, for the first time, to communicate

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
with President Buchanan,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Laughter)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Applause)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
to find the text of the telegram

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And it ends like this: "This telegraph

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world."

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And we will think about that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Because 1858

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
was also watershed year

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
in the history of Asia.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
1858 was the year

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
when the courageous uprising

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
against the foreign occupation of India

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
was defeated by the British forces.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
1858 in China

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.260
was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
were allowed to trade freely in China.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.260
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And 1858 in Japan

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And they were threatened by those black ships there,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
But, Japan, in contrast to India and China,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
maintained its national sovereignty.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
And let's see how much difference that can make.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
back to a Gapminder graph here,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
where you can see each bubble is a country.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
The size of the bubble here is the population.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.260
On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And I also bring an innovation here.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
I have transformed the laser beam

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.260
into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
(Applause)

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And we will see, you know.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Look here, 1858, India was here,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
China was here, Japan was there,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
United States and United Kingdom

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
was richer over there.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And I will start the world like this.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
India was not always like this level.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Actually if we go back into the historical record,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
there was a time hundreds of years ago

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
when the income per person in India and China

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
was even above that of Europe.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and India had been de-industrialized.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And you can see that the countries who were growing

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
their economy was United States and United Kingdom.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
and Japan was starting to catch up.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
India was trying down here.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Can you see how it starts to move there?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And Japan is trying to move up there.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And it's the new century now. Health is getting better,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
United Kingdom, United States.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And the First World War, you know,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
United Kingdom is going down.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And now comes the Spanish flu also.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And then after the First World War, they continue up.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
India and China are down in the corner.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
Not much has happened.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
They have grown their population but not much more.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
In the 1930's now, you can see

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
that Japan is going to a period of war,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
with lower life expectancy.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And the Second World War was really a terrible event,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
also economically for Japan.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
But they did recover quite fast afterwards.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And we are moving into the new world.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
In 1947 India finally

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
gained its independence.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
but in very big difficulties down there.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
(Applause)

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
in a way which surprised the world.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And what happened?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
What happens in the after independence?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
You can see that the health started to improve.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Children started to go to school.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Health services were provided.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
China recovered. Then they said,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
"Nevermore, stupid central planning."

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And they were catching up indeed.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And both countries had the better health, but still

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
a very low economy.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and a new guy turned up from the left.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And he said, "Doesn't matter

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
if a cat is white or black,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
as long as it catches mice."

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Because catching mice

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
is what the two cats wanted to do.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And you can see the two cats being here,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And they decided to go not only for health and education,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
but also starting to grow their economy.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And the market reformer was successful there.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
In '92 India follows with a market reform.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And they go quite closely together,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and you can see that the similarity with India and China,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And here they march on. And will they catch up?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
This is the big question today.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
There they are today.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Now what does it mean that the --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
(Applause)

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
the averages there -- this is the average of China.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
If I would split China, look here,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Shanghai has already catched up.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Shanghai is already there.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And it's healthier than the United States.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
inland provinces of China, is there.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
You see this enormous inequity in China,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
in the midst of fast economic growth.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And if I would also look at India,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.260
The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Kerala is flying on top there,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
matching United States in health,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
but not in economy.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
is forging forward.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
rather than between the states.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And that is not a bad thing, in itself.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
relatively close to where poor people are living.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.260
(Laughter)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Oh, they broke my frame.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Washington, D.C. went out here.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
because there is a new leader in Washington

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
who is really concerned about the health system.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
is so rich over there

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
but they are not as healthy as Kerala.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
It's quite interesting, isn't it?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.260
(Applause)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I can see a business opportunity for Kerala,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
helping fix the health system in the United States.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
(Laughter)

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
(Applause)

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
you see that in between them

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
and ahead of them,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
is the whole emerging economies of the world,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.260
which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
You can see that in health and education,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
a large part of the world population is putting forward,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
but in Africa, and other parts,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
as in rural Guizhou in China,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
there is still people with low health and very low economy.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
We have an enormous disparity in the world.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.260
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Now, back to my projections.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.260
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
I will show income per person on this axis instead,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
poor down here, rich up there.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And then time here, from 1858

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I start the world.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And we shall see what will happen with these countries.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
You see, China under foreign domination

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
But independence is coming here.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Growth is starting, economic reform.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Now, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?"

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Look at, look at the United States.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Can you see the bubble?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
The bubbles, not my bubbles,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
but the financial bubbles.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.260
That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
You see it came down there.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
And people interested in growth

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
are turning their eyes towards Asia.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
You see, Japan did it like that.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We add Japan to it.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And there is no doubt that fast catch up

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
can take place.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Can you see here what Japan did?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Japan did it like this, until full catch up,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and then they follow with the other high-income economies.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
But the real projections for those ones,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I would like to give it like this.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Can be worse, can be better.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
(Laughter)

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I think I'm in a difficult position here.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Inequalities in China and India

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.260
I consider really the big obstacle

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
is what will create a domestic market,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
what will avoid social instability,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and which will make use of the entire capacity

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
of the population.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
You know the climate. We have great international experts

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
within India telling us that the climate is changing,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and actions has to be taken,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
otherwise China and India would be the countries

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
most to suffer from climate change.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
in a good global climate policy.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
But they ain't going to pay

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
for what others, who have more money,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
have largely created, and I can agree on that.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
But what I'm really worried about is war.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Will the former rich countries really accept

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
a completely changed world economy,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and a shift of power away from where it has been

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
back to Asia?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And will Asia be able to handle that

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
new position of being in charge

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
So, always avoid war,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
because that always pushes human beings backward.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
get ready for a world in equity,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
because this is what seems to be happening.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
And that vision that I got as a young student,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:58.260
1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
is just about to happen.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And it will happen precisely

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.260
the year 2048

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in the later part of the summer, in July,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
more precisely, the 27th of July.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:21.260
(Applause)

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.260
The 27th of July, 2048

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
is my 100th birthday.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Laughter)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And I expect to speak

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.260
in the first session of the 39th TED India.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:45.260
(Applause)
