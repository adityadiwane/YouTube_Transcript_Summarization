00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.378
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:16.393
How many of you

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:19.160
took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.690
(Applause)

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.950
Woo hoo!

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.038
Well, I have to tell you, from 
the bottom of our hearts,

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:28.818
thank you so very, very much.

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:31.469
Do you know to date the ALS Association

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.787
has raised 125 million dollars?

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.363
Woo hoo! (Applause)

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.513
It takes me back to the summer of 2011.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.602
My family, my kids had all grown up.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:50.228
We were officially empty nesters,

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:53.199
and we decided, let's 
go on a family vacation.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.306
Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:56.880
came down from New York.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.342
My youngest, Andrew,

00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:00.897
he came down from his home in Charlestown

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:02.675
where he was working in Boston,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:03.916
and my son Pete,

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:06.858
who had played at 
Boston College, baseball,

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.682
had played baseball 
professionally in Europe,

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:14.559
and had now come home and was selling
group insurance, he also joined us.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:15.981
And one night, I found myself

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.602
having a beer with Pete,

00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:20.270
and Pete was looking at 
me and he just said,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.460
"You know, Mom, I don't know,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.459
selling group insurance 
is just not my passion."

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:32.087
He said, "I just don't feel 
I'm living up to my potential.

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:35.266
I don't feel this is my mission in life."

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.707
And he said, "You know, 
oh by the way, Mom,

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:41.512
I have to leave early from vacation

00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:45.956
because my inter-city league team 
that I play for made the playoffs,

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:50.665
and I have to get back to Boston 
because I can't let my team down.

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:53.880
I'm just not as passionate about my job

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.146
as I am about baseball."

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:59.269
So off Pete went, and 
left the family vacation —

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:00.985
break a mother's heart —

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:05.297
and he went, and we 
followed four days later

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.943
to see the next playoff game.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.573
We're at the playoff game, 
Pete's at the plate,

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:12.974
and a fastball's coming in,

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:15.290
and it hits him on the wrist.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.540
Oh, Pete.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.274
His wrist went completely limp, like this.

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:21.790
So for the next six months,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.470
Pete went back to his home in Southie,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.417
kept working that unpassionate job,

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:28.813
and was going to doctors

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.686
to see what was wrong with this wrist

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.556
that never came back.

00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:34.522
Six months later, in March,

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.485
he called my husband 
and me, and he said,

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:38.487
"Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor

00:02:38.487 --> 00:02:41.491
that found a diagnosis for that wrist.

00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:44.647
Do you want to come with the
doctor's appointment with me?"

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:46.620
I said, "Sure, we'll come in."

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.736
That morning, Pete, John and I

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.234
all got up, got dressed, got in our cars —

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:53.571
three separate cars

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:55.338
because we were going to go to work

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:58.547
after the doctor's appointment to
find out what happened to the wrist.

00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:01.109
We walked into the 
neurologist's office, sat down,

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.976
four doctors walk in,

00:03:02.976 --> 00:03:05.020
and the head neurologist sits down.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.060
And he says, "Well, Pete, we've
been looking at all the tests,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.473
and I have to tell you, 
it's not a sprained wrist,

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:13.854
it's not a broken wrist,

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:15.900
it's not nerve damage in the wrist,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.712
it's not an infection,

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:21.480
it's not Lyme disease."

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.140
And there was this deliberate 
elimination going up,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.723
and I was thinking to myself,

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:30.040
where is he going with this?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.210
Then he put his hands on his knees,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.361
he looked right at my 
27-year-old kid, and said,

00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:38.577
"I don't know how to 
tell a 27-year-old this:

00:03:38.577 --> 00:03:42.472
Pete, you have ALS."

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.654
ALS?

00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:49.379
I had had a friend whose 
80-year-old father had ALS.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.440
I looked at my husband, he looked at me,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.982
and then we looked at the 
doctor, and we said, "ALS?

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.218
Okay, what treatment? Let's go.

00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:59.523
What do we do? Let's go."

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:02.407
And he looked at us, and he
said, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates,

00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:04.356
I'm sorry to tell you this,

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:08.884
but there's no treatment 
and there's no cure."

00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:11.729
We were the worst culprits.

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.264
We didn't even understand

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:16.313
that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:21.805
and nothing had been done 
in the progress against ALS.

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:24.975
So we all went home, and Jenn and Dan

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:27.166
flew home from Wall Street,

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.787
Andrew came home from Charlestown,

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:32.217
and Pete went to B.C. to pick up

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:35.436
his then-girlfriend Julie 
and brought her home,

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.369
and six hours later after diagnosis,

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.125
we're sitting around 
having a family dinner,

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.460
and we're having small chat.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.279
I don't even remember 
cooking dinner that night.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:51.646
But then our leader, Pete, set the vision,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.802
and talked to us just like 
we were his new team.

00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:58.493
He said, "There will be 
no wallowing, people."

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:00.814
He goes, "We're not looking back,

00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:02.869
we're looking forward.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:08.623
What an amazing opportunity 
we have to change the world.

00:05:08.623 --> 00:05:10.958
I'm going to change the face

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.111
of this unacceptable situation of ALS.

00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:15.969
We're going to move the needle,

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.393
and I'm going to get it in front
of philanthropists like Bill Gates."

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:23.899
And that was it. We 
were given our directive.

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.130
So in the days and months that followed,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.417
within a week, we had 
our brothers and sisters

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:31.568
and our family come to us,

00:05:31.568 --> 00:05:34.063
that they were already 
creating Team Frate Train.

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:36.971
Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster;

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.318
Uncle Artie, he was the accountant;

00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:42.097
Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;

00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:44.648
and my youngest son, Andrew,

00:05:44.648 --> 00:05:47.635
quit his job, left his 
apartment in Charlestown

00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:51.601
and says, "I'm going to take care 
of Pete and be his caregiver."

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.942
Then all those people, 
classmates, teammates,

00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:57.449
coworkers that Pete had inspired

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.607
throughout his whole life,

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:03.715
the circles of Pete all started
intersecting with one another,

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:07.959
and made Team Frate Train.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:10.060
Six months after diagnosis,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.047
Pete was given an award at a 
research summit for advocacy.

00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:17.976
He got up and gave a very eloquent speech,

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:20.582
and at the end of the 
speech, there was a panel,

00:06:20.582 --> 00:06:23.480
and on the panel were these
pharmaceutical executives

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.890
and biochemists and clinicians

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.260
and I'm sitting there and 
I'm listening to them

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.482
and most of the content 
went straight over my head.

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.760
I avoided every science 
class I ever could.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.654
But I was watching these people,
and I was listening to them,

00:06:36.654 --> 00:06:39.388
and they were saying, 
"I, I do this, I do that,"

00:06:39.388 --> 00:06:43.319
and there was a real 
unfamiliarity between them.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.632
So at the end of their talk, the panel,

00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:48.465
they had questions and answers,

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:50.562
and boom, my hand went right up,

00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:51.867
and I get the microphone,

00:06:51.867 --> 00:06:53.871
and I look at them and I say, "Thank you.

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:56.270
Thank you so much for working in ALS.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.995
It means so very much to us."

00:06:57.995 --> 00:06:59.800
I said, "But I do have to tell you

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.741
that I'm watching your body language

00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:03.862
and I'm listening to what you're saying.

00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:09.233
It just doesn't seem like there's a whole 
lot of collaboration going on here.

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:12.375
And not only that, where's the flip chart

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:17.157
with the action items and the 
follow-up and the accountability?

00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:21.149
What are you going to do 
after you leave this room?"

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.984
And then I turned around

00:07:23.984 --> 00:07:30.750
and there was about 200 pairs 
of eyes just staring at me.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.310
And it was that point that I realized

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.781
that I had talked about 
the elephant in the room.

00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:41.892
Thus my mission had begun.

00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:44.862
So over the next couple of years,

00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:47.500
Pete — we've had our highs and our lows.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.938
Pete was put on a compassionate use drug.

00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:53.121
It was hope in a bottle for 
the whole ALS community.

00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.330
It was in a phase III trial.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.916
Then six months later, the 
data comes back: no efficacy.

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:02.388
We were supposed to 
have therapies overseas,

00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:04.537
and the rug was 
pulled out from under us.

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:06.482
So for the next two years,

00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:10.764
we just watched my son 
be taken away from me,

00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:14.435
little by little every day.

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:16.952
Two and a half years ago,

00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:20.110
Pete was hitting home 
runs at baseball fields.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.940
Today, Pete's completely paralyzed.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.306
He can't hold his head up any longer.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.920
He's confined to a motorized wheelchair.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.138
He can no longer swallow or eat.

00:08:31.138 --> 00:08:33.033
He has a feeding tube.

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:35.698
He can't speak.

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:40.775
He talks with eye gaze technology

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.726
and a speech generating device,

00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:44.195
and we're watching his lungs,

00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:47.200
because his diaphragm 
eventually is going to give out

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.978
and then the decision will be made
to put him on a ventilator or not.

00:08:51.978 --> 00:09:01.586
ALS robs the human of all their physical 
parts, but the brain stays intact.

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:06.207
So July 4th, 2014,

00:09:06.207 --> 00:09:10.615
75th year of Lou Gehrig's 
inspirational speech comes,

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:16.159
and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write
an article in the Bleacher Report.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:23.252
And it was very significant, because he 
wrote it using his eye gaze technology.

00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:29.501
Twenty days later, 
the ice started to fall.

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:34.176
On July 27th, Pete's 
roommate in New York City,

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:36.785
wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:40.635
signifying Pat Quinn, another 
ALS patient known in New York,

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:42.686
and B.C. shorts

00:09:42.686 --> 00:09:47.178
said, "I'm taking the ALS 
Ice Bucket Challenge,"

00:09:47.178 --> 00:09:49.958
picked up the ice, put it over his head.

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.166
"And I'm nominating ..." 
And he sent it up to Boston.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:57.590
And that was on July 27th.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.161
Over the next couple 
of days, our news feed

00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:02.696
was full of family and friends.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:05.374
If you haven't gone back,
the nice thing about Facebook

00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:07.587
is that you have the dates, you can go back.

00:10:07.587 --> 00:10:11.558
You've got to see Uncle Artie's 
human Bloody Mary.

00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:14.704
I'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,

00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:17.666
and that was probably in day two.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:21.636
By about day four, Uncle 
Dave, the webmaster,

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:23.609
he isn't on Facebook,

00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:26.496
and I get a text from him, 
and it says, "Nancy,

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:29.390
what the hell is going on?"

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.987
Uncle Dave gets a hit 
every time Pete's website

00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:36.010
is gone onto, and his 
phone was blowing up.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.865
So we all sat down and we realized,

00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:41.717
money is coming in — how amazing.

00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:44.261
So we knew awareness 
would lead to funding,

00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:47.239
we just didn't know it would
only take a couple of days.

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:52.396
So we got together, put our best 
501(c)(3)s on Pete's website,

00:10:52.396 --> 00:10:54.505
and off we went.

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:57.686
So week one, Boston media.

00:10:57.686 --> 00:11:00.154
Week two, national media.

00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:02.608
It was during week two 
that our neighbor next door

00:11:02.608 --> 00:11:05.000
opened up our door and threw a pizza

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.360
across the kitchen floor, saying,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.299
"I think you people might 
need food in there."

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:12.504
(Laughter)

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:16.520
Week three, celebrities — 
Entertainment Tonight,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.586
Access Hollywood.

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:24.741
Week four, global — BBC, Irish Radio.

00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:27.663
Did anyone see "Lost In Translation"?

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:29.852
My husband did Japanese television.

00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:31.562
It was interesting.

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:33.614
(Laughter)

00:11:33.614 --> 00:11:39.376
And those videos, the popular ones.

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:43.864
Paul Bissonnette's 
glacier video, incredible.

00:11:43.864 --> 00:11:46.601
How about the redemption nuns of Dublin?

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:48.306
Who's seen that one?

00:11:48.306 --> 00:11:50.893
It's absolutely fantastic.

00:11:50.893 --> 00:11:53.110
J.T., Justin Timberlake.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.879
That's when we knew, that 
was a real A-list celebrity.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:59.770
I go back on my texts, and I can see

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.902
"JT! JT!" My sister texting me.

00:12:04.902 --> 00:12:08.150
Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.956
Incredible.

00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:12.266
And the ALS patients,

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:15.460
you know what their favorite
ones are, and their families'?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.050
All of them.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.898
Because this misunderstood and 
underfunded "rare" disease,

00:12:21.898 --> 00:12:28.378
they just sat and watched people 
saying it over and over: "ALS, ALS."

00:12:28.378 --> 00:12:31.587
It was unbelievable.

00:12:31.587 --> 00:12:33.630
And those naysayers,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.469
let's just talk a couple 
of stats, shall we?

00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:39.107
Okay, so the ALS Association,

00:12:39.107 --> 00:12:43.064
they think by year end,
it'll be 160 million dollars.

00:12:43.064 --> 00:12:45.649
ALS TDI in Cambridge,

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:47.701
they raised three million dollars.

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.143
Well, guess what?

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.437
They had a clinical trial for a drug
that they've been developing.

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:55.553
It was on a three-year track for funding.

00:12:55.553 --> 00:12:57.040
Two months.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.328
It's coming out starting in two months.

00:12:59.328 --> 00:13:03.268
(Applause)

00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:10.806
And YouTube has reported

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:17.884
that over 150 countries have posted
Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS.

00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:24.455
And Facebook, 2.5 million videos,

00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:27.570
and I had the awesome adventure

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.290
visiting the Facebook campus last week,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.057
and I said to them, "I know
what it was like in my house.

00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:35.677
I can't imagine what it 
was like around here."

00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:40.390
All she said was, "Jaw-dropping."

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.370
And my family's favorite video?

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.576
Bill Gates.

00:13:48.576 --> 00:13:51.659
Because the night Pete was diagnosed,

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:59.244
he told us that he was going to get ALS in
front of philanthropists like Bill Gates,

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:00.790
and he did it.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.260
Goal number one, check.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.203
Now on to the treatment and cure.

00:14:05.203 --> 00:14:11.498
(Applause)

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.829
So okay, after all of this ice,

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:19.725
we know that it was much more

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:22.547
than just pouring buckets of 
ice water over your head,

00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:24.375
and I really would like to leave you

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:27.289
with a couple of things that 
I'd like you to remember.

00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:28.964
The first thing is,

00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:31.190
every morning when you wake up,

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.266
you can choose to live your day in positivity.

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:38.520
Would any of you blame me

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.859
if I just was in the fetal position

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:44.096
and pulled the covers 
over my head every day?

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:46.308
No, I don't think anybody would blame me,

00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:49.310
but Pete has inspired us to wake up

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.496
every morning and be 
positive and proactive.

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:55.300
I actually had to ditch support groups

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.779
because everybody was in there saying that

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.613
spraying their lawns with chemicals,

00:14:59.613 --> 00:15:01.481
that's why they got ALS,

00:15:01.481 --> 00:15:03.440
and I was like, "I don't think so,"

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.459
but I had to get away from the negativity.

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:10.346
The second thing I want to leave you with

00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:13.160
is the person at the 
middle of the challenge

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.240
has to be willing to have 
the mental toughness

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.985
to put themselves out there.

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.210
Pete still goes to baseball games

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.264
and he still sits with his 
teammates in the dugout,

00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:28.147
and he hangs his gravity feed bag

00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:29.547
right on the cages.

00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:31.317
You'll see the kids, they're 
up there hanging it up.

00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:32.988
"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup."

00:15:32.988 --> 00:15:36.239
And then they put it 
right into his stomach.

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.641
Because he wants them to see
what the reality of this is,

00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:43.013
and how he's never, ever going to give up.

00:15:43.013 --> 00:15:45.243
And the third thing I 
want to leave you with:

00:15:45.243 --> 00:15:48.759
If you ever come across a situation

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:51.898
that you see as so unacceptable,

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:55.621
I want you to dig down as deep as you can

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.476
and find your best mother bear

00:15:58.476 --> 00:16:00.885
and go after it.

00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:06.438
(Applause)

00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:36.954
Thank you.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:40.771
(Applause)

00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:42.430
I know that I'm running over,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.197
but I've got to leave you with this:

00:16:44.197 --> 00:16:47.371
the gifts that my son has given me.

00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:50.084
I have had 29 years

00:16:50.084 --> 00:16:53.900
of having the honor of being the mother

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.939
of Pete Frates.

00:16:55.939 --> 00:17:00.985
Pete Frates has been inspiring 
and leading his whole life.

00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:03.257
He's thrown out kindness,

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:06.897
and all that kindness 
has come back to him.

00:17:06.897 --> 00:17:13.336
He walks the face of the Earth 
right now and knows why he's here.

00:17:13.342 --> 00:17:16.190
What a gift.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.821
The second thing that my son has given me

00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:21.876
is he's given me my mission in life.

00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:23.680
Now I know why I'm here.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.824
I'm going to save my son,

00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:29.614
and if it doesn't happen in time for him,

00:17:29.614 --> 00:17:32.256
I'm going to work so that no other mother

00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:35.815
has to go through what I'm going through.

00:17:35.815 --> 00:17:38.509
And the third thing, 
and last but not least

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:41.546
gift that my son has given me,

00:17:41.546 --> 00:17:43.633
as an exclamation point

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.426
to the miraculous month

00:17:45.426 --> 00:17:49.104
of August 2014:

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:55.248
That girlfriend that he went to get on 
the night of diagnosis is now his wife,

00:17:55.248 --> 00:18:03.625
and Pete and Julie have given me my 
granddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:08.730
Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.928
as the exclamation point

00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:15.307
on August 31st, 2014.

00:18:15.307 --> 00:18:16.981
And so —

00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:25.865
(Applause) —

00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:29.509
And so let me leave you with 
Pete's words of inspiration

00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:36.777
that he would use to classmates,
coworkers and teammates.

00:18:36.777 --> 00:18:40.153
Be passionate.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.660
Be genuine.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.654
Be hardworking.

00:18:45.654 --> 00:18:49.938
And don't forget to be great.

00:18:49.938 --> 00:18:52.362
Thank you. (Applause)
