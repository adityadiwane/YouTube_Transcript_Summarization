00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
So I was privileged to train in transplantation

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
under two great surgical pioneers:

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Thomas Starzl,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
who performed the world's first successful liver transplant

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
in 1967,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and Sir Roy Calne,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
in the following year.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I returned to Singapore

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and, in 1990,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
performed Asia's first successful

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
cadaveric liver transplant procedure,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
but against all odds.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Now when I look back,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
the transplant was actually the easiest part.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
But perhaps the most challenging part

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
was to convince the regulators --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
a matter which was debated in the parliament --

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that a young female surgeon

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
be allowed the opportunity

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
to pioneer for her country.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
But 20 years on,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
my patient, Surinder,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
is Asia's longest surviving

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
cadaveric liver transplant to date.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
(Applause)

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And perhaps more important,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I am the proud godmother

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
to her 14 year-old son.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Applause)

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But not all patients on the transplant wait list

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
are so fortunate.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
The truth is,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
there are just simply not enough donor organs

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
to go around.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
As the demand for donor organs

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
continues to rise,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in large part due to the aging population,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
the supply has remained relatively constant.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
In the United States alone,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
100,000 men, women and children

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
are on the waiting list for donor organs,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and more than a dozen die each day

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because of a lack of donor organs.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
The transplant community

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
has actively campaigned in organ donation.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And the gift of life

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
has been extended

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
from brain-dead donors

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to living, related donors --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
relatives who might donate an organ

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
or a part of an organ,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
like a split liver graft,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to a relative or loved one.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
the gift of life was then extended

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
from living, related donors

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to now living, unrelated donors.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And this then has given rise

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
to unprecedented and unexpected

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
moral controversy.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
How can one distinguish

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
a donation that is voluntary and altruistic

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
from one that is forced or coerced

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
from, for example,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
a submissive spouse, an in-law,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
a servant, a slave,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
an employee?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Where and how can we draw the line?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
In my part of the world,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
too many people live below the poverty line.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And in some areas,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
the commercial gifting of an organ

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
in exchange for monetary reward

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
has led to a flourishing trade

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
in living, unrelated donors.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I received my next assignment,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and that was to go to the prisons

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
to harvest organs

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
from executed prisoners.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I was also pregnant at the time.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Pregnancies are meant

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to be happy and fulfilling moments

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
in any woman's life.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But my joyful period

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.260
was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
thoughts of walking through

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
the prison's high-security death row,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
as this was the only route

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
to take me to the makeshift operating room.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And at each time,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I would feel the chilling stares

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And for two years,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I struggled with the dilemma

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
of waking up at 4:30 am

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
on a Friday morning,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
driving to the prison,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
getting down, gloved and scrubbed,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
ready to receive the body

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
of an executed prisoner,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
remove the organs

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and then transport these organs

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
to the recipient hospital

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and then graft the gift of life

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to a recipient the same afternoon.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
No doubt, I was informed,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
the consent had been obtained.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
But, in my life,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
the one fulfilling skill that I had

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
was now invoking feelings of conflict --

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
conflict ranging

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to celebratory joy

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
In my team,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
the lives of one or two of my colleagues

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
were tainted by this experience.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Some of us may have been sublimated,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
but really none of us remained the same.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
I was troubled

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
was at least as morally controversial

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
as the harvesting of stem cells

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
from human embryos.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And in my mind,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I realized as a surgical pioneer

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
that the purpose of my position of influence

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
was surely to speak up

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
for those who have no influence.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
It made me wonder

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
if there could be a better way --

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
a way to circumvent death

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and yet deliver the gift of life

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that might exponentially impact

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
millions of patients worldwide.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Now just about that time,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
the practice of surgery evolved

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
from big to small,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
from wide open incisions

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
to keyhole procedures,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
tiny incisions.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And in transplantation, concepts shifted

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
from whole organs to cells.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
I participated in a small series

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
of whole organ pancreas transplants.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I witnessed the technical difficulty.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And this inspired in my mind

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.260
a shift from transplanting whole organs

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to perhaps transplanting cells.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I thought to myself,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
why not take the individual cells

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
out of the pancreas --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and transplant these cells? --

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
technically a much simpler procedure

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
than having to grapple with the complexities

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
of transplanting a whole organ.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And at that time,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
stem cell research

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
had gained momentum,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
following the isolation of the world's first

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
human embryonic stem cells

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in the 1990s.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
The observation that stem cells, as master cells,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
could give rise

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
to a whole variety of different cell types --

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
heart cells, liver cells,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
pancreatic islet cells --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
captured the attention of the media

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and the imagination of the public.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
I too was fascinated

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
by this new and disruptive cell technology,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and this inspired a shift in my mindset,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
from transplanting whole organs

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
to transplanting cells.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And I focused my research on stem cells

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
as a possible source

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
for cell transplants.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Today we realize

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
that there are many different types of stem cells.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Embryonic stem cells

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
have occupied center stage,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
chiefly because of their pluripotency --

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
that is their ease in differentiating

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
into a variety of different cell types.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
But the moral controversy

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
surrounding embryonic stem cells --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
the fact that these cells are derived

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
from five-day old human embryos --

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
has encouraged research

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
into other types of stem cells.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
I inspired my lab

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
to focus on what I thought

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.260
was the most non-controversial source of stem cells,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
nowadays available in abundant supply --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.260
you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Fat-derived stem cells

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
are adult stem cells.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
And adult stem cells

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
are found in you and me --

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
in our blood, in our bone marrow,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in our fat, our skin and other organs.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And as it turns out,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
fat is one of the best sources

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
of adult stem cells.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But adult stem cells

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
are not embryonic stem cells.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And here is the limitation:

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
adult stem cells are mature cells,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and, like mature human beings,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
these cells are more restricted in their thought

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and more restricted in their behavior

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and are unable to give rise

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
to the wide variety of specialized cell types,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
as embryonic stem cells [can].

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
But in 2007,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
two remarkable individuals,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
Shinya Yamanaka of Japan

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and Jamie Thomson of the United States,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
made an astounding discovery.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
They discovered

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
that adult cells, taken from you and me,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
could be reprogrammed

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
back into embryonic-like cells,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
which they termed IPS cells,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.260
or induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And so guess what,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
scientists around the world and in the labs

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
are racing

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
to convert aging adult cells --

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
aging adult cells from you and me --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
they are racing to reprogram these cells

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.260
back into more useful IPS cells.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And in our lab,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
we are focused on taking fat

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and reprogramming

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
mounds of fat

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
into fountains of youthful cells --

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
cells that we may use

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
to then form other,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
more specialized, cells,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
which one day may be used as cell transplants.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
If this research is successful,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
it may then reduce the need

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
to research and sacrifice

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
human embryos.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
that the promise of stem cells

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
will one day provide cures

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
for a whole range of conditions.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
retinal eye diseases --

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
are any of these conditions

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
relevant, personally, to you?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
In May 2006,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
something horrible happened to me.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
I was about to start a robotic operation,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
but stepping out of the elevator

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I realized

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
that my left visual field

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
was fast collapsing into darkness.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Earlier that week,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I had taken a rather hard knock

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And I started to see floaters and stars,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
which I casually dismissed

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
as too much high-altitude sun exposure.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
What happened to me

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
might have been catastrophic,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
if not for the fact

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that I was in reach of good surgical access.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And I had my vision restored,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
three months --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
in a head down position.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
This experience

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
taught me to empathize more with my patients,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and especially those with retinal diseases.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
37 million people worldwide

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
are blind,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and 127 million more

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
suffer from impaired vision.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
now in a research phase,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
may one day restore vision,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
or part vision,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Indeed, we live

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
in both challenging

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
as well as exciting times.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
As the world population ages,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
scientists are racing

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
to discover new ways

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
to enhance the power of the body

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
to heal itself through stem cells.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
It is a fact

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
that when our organs or tissues are injured,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
our bone marrow

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
releases stem cells

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
into our circulation.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And these stem cells

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
then float in the bloodstream

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and hone in to damaged organs

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
to release growth factors

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
to repair the damaged tissue.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Stem cells may be used as building blocks

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.260
to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
or to provide new liver cells

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
to repair damaged liver.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
researching the use of stem cells

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
for liver diseases.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
What lies ahead?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Heart disease

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
is the leading cause of death worldwide.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
1.1 million Americans

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
suffer heart attacks yearly.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
4.8 million

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
suffer cardiac failure.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Stem cells may be used

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
to deliver growth factors

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
to repair damaged heart muscle

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
or be differentiated

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
into heart muscle cells

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
to restore heart function.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
There are 170 clinical trials

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.260
investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
While still in a research phase,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
stem cells may one day herald

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
small, incremental steps,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
cells rather than organs,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
repair rather than replacement.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Stem cell therapies

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.260
may one day reduce the need for donor organs.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Powerful new technologies

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
always present enigmas.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
As we speak,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
is currently underway

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
following the USFDA approval.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And in the U.K.,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
neural stem cells to treat stroke

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
are being investigated in a phase one trial.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
The research success that we celebrate today

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
has been made possible

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.260
by the curiosity and contribution and commitment

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
of individual scientists

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and medical pioneers.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Each one has his story.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
My story has been about my journey

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
from organs to cells --

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
a journey through controversy,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
inspired by hope --

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
hope that, as we age,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
you and I may one day celebrate longevity

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
with an improved quality of life.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
Thank you.
