00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:14.363
In 1991 I had

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:17.121
maybe the most profound and transformative

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.687
experience of my life.

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:23.414
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.605
I took a couple victory laps in there.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.827
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:32.484
and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:34.550
and we were relaxing next to this beautiful

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.739
idyllic lake in the mountains.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.135
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.851
and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.819
from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.292
rolling toward us,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.939
and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.337
so help me God, every single animal in that place

00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:57.553
stopped making noise at the same time.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.637
(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.

00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:04.697
And then the clouds came over us, and then,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:09.007
boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.469
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.472
I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:17.973
and decided to set it to music,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.154
a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:23.317
which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:27.692
Now fast forward to just three years ago.

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:31.133
(Music) And we released to YouTube this,

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.389
the Virtual Choir Project,

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.596
185 singers from 12 different countries.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.033
You can see my little video there conducting these people,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.188
alone in their dorm rooms

00:01:41.188 --> 00:01:44.277
or in their living rooms at home.

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:48.003
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.550
Virtual Choir 2,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.112
2,052 singers from 58 different countries,

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:59.403
this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."

00:01:59.403 --> 00:02:04.697
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:07.253
"Water Night," another piece that I had written,

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:13.517
this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:18.936
(Music)

00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:21.943
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:24.093
of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:28.854
he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:31.357
Could we do this all in real time?

00:02:31.357 --> 00:02:34.397
Could we have people singing together in real time?

00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:35.992
And with the help of Skype,

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:38.096
that is what we are going to attempt today.

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:40.269
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.421
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.917
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:49.245
Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:52.565
some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and â€”

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:59.603
(Applause) --

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:01.789
and in the second half of the piece,

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.611
the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:06.661
from 30 different countries.

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:09.245
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:12.077
but there's still less than a second of latency,

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:14.156
but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.

00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:15.608
We deal in milliseconds.

00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:18.075
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:20.578
so that it embraces the latency

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:23.483
and the performers sing into the latency

00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:25.981
instead of trying to be exactly together.

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.245
So with deep humility, and for your approval,

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:31.357
we present "Cloudburst."

00:03:31.357 --> 00:03:36.076
(Applause)

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:39.833
(Piano)

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.785
[The rain ...]

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:56.809
[Eyes of shadow-water]

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:02.002
[eyes of well-water]

00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:23.275
[eyes of dream-water.]

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.451
[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,]

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.731
[birdbeaks of light pecking open]

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:57.459
[pomegranate stars.]

00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:09.898
[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:27.044
[Only blood, only dust,]

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.867
[only naked footsteps on the thorns?]

00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:50.587
[The rain awakens...]

00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:07.583
[We must sleep with open eyes,]

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:12.026
[we must dream with our hands,]

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.426
[we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,]

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:29.090
[of the sun dreaming its worlds.]

00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:45.690
[We must dream aloud,]

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:08.315
[we must sing till the song puts forth roots,]

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.899
[trunk, branches, birds, stars.]

00:07:57.475 --> 00:08:02.455
[We must find the lost word,]

00:08:12.322 --> 00:08:15.375
[and remember what the blood,]

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:24.658
[the tides, the earth, and the body say,]

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:53.759
[and return to the point of departure...]

00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:14.415
(Music)

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:49.169
(Applause)

00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:51.478
["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:58.881
Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.

00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:03.413
(Applause)

00:12:20.622 --> 00:12:25.485
Thank you.
