00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.712
When I was a child, I always
wanted to be a superhero.

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:22.172
I wanted to save the world
and make everyone happy.

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:25.989
But I knew that I'd need superpowers
to make my dreams come true.

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:28.236
So I used to embark
on these imaginary journeys

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.749
to find intergalactic objects
from planet Krypton,

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:34.487
which was a lot of fun,
but didn't yield much result.

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.060
When I grew up and realized

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:40.236
that science fiction was not
a good source for superpowers,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.582
I decided instead to embark
on a journey of real science,

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.236
to find a more useful truth.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.236
I started my journey in California,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.505
with a UC Berkeley
30-year longitudinal study

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:55.236
that examined the photos
of students in an old yearbook,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.802
and tried to measure their success
and well-being throughout their life.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.874
By measuring the students' smiles,

00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:03.683
researchers were able to predict

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:07.924
how fulfilling and long-lasting
a subject's marriage would be,

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.010
(Laughter)

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:12.955
how well she would score
on standardized tests of well-being,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.260
and how inspiring she would be to others.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.412
In another yearbook, I stumbled
upon Barry Obama's picture.

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:21.663
When I first saw his picture,

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:24.846
I thought that his superpowers
came from his super collar.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.950
(Laughter)

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:27.941
But now I know it was all in his smile.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.266
Another aha! moment came from a 2010
Wayne State University research project

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.529
that looked into pre-1950s
baseball cards of Major League players.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.543
The researchers found
that the span of a player's smile

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.236
could actually predict
the span of his life.

00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:48.236
Players who didn't smile in their pictures

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.236
lived an average of only 72.9 years,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.841
where players with beaming smiles

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:56.236
lived an average of almost 80 years.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.651
(Laughter)

00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:01.500
The good news is that
we're actually born smiling.

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:03.803
Using 3D ultrasound technology,

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:07.405
we can now see that developing
babies appear to smile,

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.579
even in the womb.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.236
When they're born,
babies continue to smile --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.236
initially, mostly in their sleep.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.236
And even blind babies smile

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.649
to the sound of the human voice.

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.236
Smiling is one of the most basic,
biologically uniform

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.697
expressions of all humans.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.785
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:31.080
Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned
researcher on facial expressions,

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:34.236
found that even members of the Fore tribe,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.432
who were completely disconnected
from Western culture,

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.719
and also known for their
unusual cannibalism rituals,

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:42.027
(Laughter)

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.694
attributed smiles
to descriptions of situations

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:46.662
the same way you and I would.

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.893
So from Papua New Guinea

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.091
to Hollywood

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.527
all the way to modern art in Beijing,

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.956
we smile often,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.432
and use smiles to express
joy and satisfaction.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.236
How many people here in this room
smile more than 20 times per day?

00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:05.995
Raise your hand if you do.

00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:07.780
Oh, wow.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:09.661
Outside of this room,

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.995
more than a third of us smile
more than 20 times per day,

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.186
whereas less than 14 percent of us
smile less than five.

00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:23.205
In fact, those with the most amazing
superpowers are actually children,

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.236
who smile as many as 400 times per day.

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.451
Have you ever wondered
why being around children,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:33.260
who smile so frequently,
makes you smile very often?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.147
A recent study
at Uppsala University in Sweden

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:42.036
found that it's very difficult to frown
when looking at someone who smiles.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.482
You ask why?

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.966
Because smiling
is evolutionarily contagious,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.410
and it suppresses the control
we usually have on our facial muscles.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:54.576
Mimicking a smile
and experiencing it physically

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.236
helps us understand whether
our smile is fake or real,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.687
so we can understand
the emotional state of the smiler.

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:04.236
In a recent mimicking study

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.236
at the University
of Clermont-Ferrand in France,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.236
subjects were asked to determine
whether a smile was real or fake

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.609
while holding a pencil in their mouth
to repress smiling muscles.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.973
Without the pencil,
subjects were excellent judges,

00:04:18.997 --> 00:04:20.877
but with the pencil in their mouth --

00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:23.496
when they could not mimic
the smile they saw --

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.426
their judgment was impaired.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.236
(Laughter)

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.585
In addition to theorizing on evolution
in "The Origin of Species,"

00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:34.816
Charles Darwin also wrote
the facial feedback response theory.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:40.654
His theory states that the act of smiling
itself actually makes us feel better,

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:44.670
rather than smiling being
merely a result of feeling good.

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:49.260
In his study, Darwin actually cited
a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:54.640
who sent electric jolts to facial muscles
to induce and stimulate smiles.

00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:56.568
Please, don't try this at home.

00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:58.236
(Laughter)

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:00.545
In a related German study,

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.236
researchers used fMRI imaging
to measure brain activity

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.696
before and after injecting Botox
to suppress smiling muscles.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.546
The finding supported Darwin's theory,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.443
by showing that facial feedback

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:18.236
modifies the neural processing
of emotional content in the brain,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
in a way that helps us
feel better when we smile.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.202
Smiling stimulates
our brain reward mechanism

00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:26.750
in a way that even chocolate --

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:29.583
a well-regarded pleasure inducer --

00:05:29.607 --> 00:05:30.766
cannot match.

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:34.503
British researchers found that one smile

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:37.236
can generate the same level
of brain stimulation

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.236
as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.908
(Laughter)

00:05:42.932 --> 00:05:44.091
Wait --

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:47.922
The same study found
that smiling is as stimulating

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:52.052
as receiving up to 16,000
pounds sterling in cash.

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.077
(Laughter)

00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:54.946
That's like 25 grand a smile.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.121
It's not bad.

00:05:56.703 --> 00:05:58.148
And think about it this way:

00:05:58.172 --> 00:06:00.861
25,000 times 400 --

00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:04.306
quite a few kids out there feel
like Mark Zuckerberg every day.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.075
(Laughter)

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.688
And unlike lots of chocolate,

00:06:07.712 --> 00:06:09.997
lots of smiling can actually
make you healthier.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:14.305
Smiling can help reduce the level
of stress-enhancing hormones

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:17.510
like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,

00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:21.228
increase the level of mood-enhancing
hormones like endorphins,

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:23.795
and reduce overall blood pressure.

00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:25.763
And if that's not enough,

00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:29.040
smiling can actually make you
look good in the eyes of others.

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.236
A recent study at Penn State University
found that when you smile,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.115
you don't only appear to be
more likable and courteous,

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.236
but you actually appear
to be more competent.

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.435
So whenever you want
to look great and competent,

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:46.236
reduce your stress
or improve your marriage,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.148
or feel as if you just had a whole stack
of high-quality chocolate

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:52.236
without incurring the caloric cost,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.093
or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket
of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:01.631
or whenever you want
to tap into a superpower

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.617
that will help you and everyone around you

00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:08.444
live a longer, healthier, happier life,

00:07:08.468 --> 00:07:09.767
smile.

00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:14.498
(Applause)
