00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The question today is not:

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Why did we invade Afghanistan?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
The question is:

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
why are we still in Afghanistan

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
one decade later?

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Why are we spending

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.260
$135 billion?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Why were more people killed

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
last month

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
than in any preceding month

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
of this conflict?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
How has this happened?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
The last 20 years

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
has been the age of intervention,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and Afghanistan is simply one act

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
in a five-act tragedy.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
We came out of the end of the Cold War

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in despair.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
We faced Rwanda;

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
we faced Bosnia,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and then we rediscovered our confidence.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and we seemed to succeed.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
In the fourth act, with our hubris,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
our overconfidence developing,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and in the fifth act,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
we plunged into a humiliating mess.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
So the question is: What are we doing?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And the answer, of course,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that we keep being given

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
is as follows:

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
we're told that we went into Afghanistan

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
because of 9/11,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and that we remain there

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
because the Taliban poses an existential threat

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to global security.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
In the words of President Obama,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
"If the Taliban take over again,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
they will invite back Al-Qaeda,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
who will try to kill as many of our people

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
as they possibly can."

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
The story that we're told

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is that there was a "light footprint" initially --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
in other words, that we ended up in a situation

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
where we didn't have enough troops,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
we didn't have enough resources,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that Afghans were frustrated --

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
they felt there wasn't enough progress

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and economic development and security,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and therefore the Taliban came back --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
that we responded in 2005 and 2006

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
with troop deployments,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And that it wasn't until 2009,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
when President Obama signed off on a surge,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that we finally had,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in the words of Secretary Clinton,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
So, as the president now reassures us,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.260
we are on track to achieve our goals.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
All of this is wrong.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Every one of those statements is wrong.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Afghanistan does not

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
pose an existential threat

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
to global security.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It is extremely unlikely

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country --

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They simply don't have a conventional military option.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
it's extremely unlikely

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
From the Taliban's point of view,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
that was their number one mistake last time.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
they would still be in power today.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And even if I'm wrong about those two things,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
even if they were able to take back the country,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
it's extremely unlikely

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
its ability to harm the United States

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
or harm Europe.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
If the Al-Qaeda base

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
was to be established near Ghazni,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
we would hit them very hard,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and it would be very, very difficult

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
for the Taliban to protect them.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Furthermore, it's simply not true

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that what went wrong in Afghanistan

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
is the light footprint.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
In my experience, in fact,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.260
the light footprint was extremely helpful.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And these troops that we brought in --

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
it's a great picture of David Beckham

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
there on the sub-machine gun --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
made the situation worse, not better.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
When I walked across Afghanistan

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
in the winter of 2001-2002,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
what I saw was scenes like this.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
A girl, if you're lucky,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
in the corner of a dark room --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
lucky to be able to look at the Koran.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
But in those early days

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Within a few months,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
there were two and a half million more girls in school.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
the nearest health clinic

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
was within three days walk.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Today, there are 14 health clinics

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
in that area alone.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
There was amazing improvements.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
We went from almost no Afghans

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
having mobile telephones during the Taliban

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
to a situation where, almost overnight,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
three million Afghans had mobile telephones.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And we had progress in the free media.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We had progress in elections --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
all of this with the so-called light footprint.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
But when we began to bring more money,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
when we began to invest more resources,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
things got worse, not better. How?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
into a country like Afghanistan

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
where the entire revenue of the Afghan state

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
is one billion dollars a year,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
you drown everything.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It's not simply corruption and waste

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that you create;

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
the elected Afghan government,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
with the micromanaging tendencies

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
of foreigners on short tours

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
with their own priorities.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And the same is true for the troops.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
When I walked across Afghanistan,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
I stayed with people like this.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
He was very generous,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
like many of the Afghans I stayed with.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
But he was also considerably more conservative,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
considerably more anti-foreign,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
considerably more Islamist

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
than we'd like to acknowledge.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
tried to shoot me.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
is I was somewhat frightened,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and I was too afraid on this occasion

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and taken refuge in this house,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.260
why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
But 18 months later, I asked him

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
why he had tried to shoot me.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Nadir Shah

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
had bet him that he couldn't hit me.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Now this is not to say

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
It's not; it's a wonderful place

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
full of incredible energy and intelligence.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
But it is a place

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
where the putting-in of the troops

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
has increased the violence rather than decreased it.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
an agricultural engineer,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
could travel through Helmand,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Today, he could never do that.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So the idea that we deployed the troops

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
to respond to the Taliban insurgency

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
is mistaken.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Rather than preceding the insurgency,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
the Taliban followed the troop deployment,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and as far as I'm concerned,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
the troop deployment caused their return.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Now is this a new idea?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
No, there have been any number of people

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
saying this over the last seven years.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I ran a center at Harvard

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
from 2008 to 2010,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and there were people like Michael Semple there

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
who speak Afghan languages fluently,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
who've traveled to almost every district in the country.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Andrew Wilder, for example,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
born on the Pakistan-Iranian border,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
served his whole life

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 --

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
worked for Save the Children,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
These are people

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
who were able to say consistently

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
that the increase in development aid

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
that the counter-insurgency strategy

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
was not working and would not work.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And yet, nobody listened to them.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Instead,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
there was a litany of astonishing optimism.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Beginning in 2004,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
every general came in saying,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
"I've inherited a dismal situation,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
which will deliver,"

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
in General Barno's word in 2004,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
the "decisive year."

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Well guess what? It didn't.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
that he had the strategy and the resources

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
to deliver, in 2005,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
the "decisive year."

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Or General David Richards to come in 2006

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and say he had the strategy and the resources

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
to deliver the "crunch year."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Or in 2007,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
to say that that would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Or in 2008, Major General Champoux

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
to come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Or in 2009, my great friend,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
General Stanley McChrystal,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
who said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Or in 2010,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
assures us that we are in the "decisive year."

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:03.260
(Applause)

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
How do we allow

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
any of this to happen?

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Well the answer, of course, is,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
dollars a year in a country,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
you co-opt almost everybody.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Even the aid agencies,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
who begin to receive an enormous amount of money

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
from the U.S. and the European governments

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
to build schools and clinics,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
are somewhat disinclined

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
to challenge the idea

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
that Afghanistan is an existential threat

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
to global security.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They're worried, in other words,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Oxfam, Save the Children

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
wouldn't get the money

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
to build their hospitals and schools.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
It's also very difficult to confront a general

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
with medals on his chest.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
It's very difficult for a politician,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
You feel deep, deep guilt.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
You exaggerate your fears,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
and you're terrified about the humiliation

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
of defeat.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
What is the solution to this?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Well the solution to this

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
is we need to find a way

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
that people like Michael Semple, or those other people,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
who are telling the truth, who know the country,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
who've spent 30 years on the ground --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and most importantly of all,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
the missing component of this --

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Afghans themselves,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
who understand what is going on.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
We need to somehow get their message

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
to the policymakers.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And this is very difficult to do

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
because of our structures.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
The first thing we need to change

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
is the structures of our government.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Very, very sadly,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
our foreign services, the United Nations,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
the military in these countries

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
have very little idea of what's going on.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
the American military, on tours of 12 months.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
with these somewhat threatening security teams

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
who ready 24 hours in advance

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
In the British embassy in Afghanistan

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
in 2008,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
an embassy of 350 people,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
there were only three people who could speak Dari,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And there was not a single Pashto speaker.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
In the Afghan section in London

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
I was told last year

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
that there was not a single staff member

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
of the foreign office in that section

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
who had ever served

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
on a posting in Afghanistan.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
So we need to change that institutional culture.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And I could make the same points about the United States

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and the United Nations.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that we understand that optimism

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
is in the DNA of the military,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
that we don't respond to it

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
with quite as much alacrity.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And thirdly, we need to have some humility.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
We need to begin from the position

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
that our knowledge, our power,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
our legitimacy

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
is limited.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
This doesn't mean

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
that intervention around the world is a disaster.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
It isn't.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
Bosnia and Kosovo

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
were signal successes,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
great successes.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Today when you go to Bosnia

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
it is almost impossible to believe

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.260
that what we saw in the early 1990s happened.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
since 1994.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Refugee return,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
thought would be extremely unlikely,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
has largely happened.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
A million properties have been returned.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Borders between the Bosniak territory

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
The national army has shrunk.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
The crime rates in Bosnia today

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
are lower than they are in Sweden.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
This has been done

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
by an incredible, principled effort

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
by the international community,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
and, of course, above all,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
by Bosnians themselves.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
But you need to look at context.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
You need to understand that in those places

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
what really mattered

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
in coming to the agreement,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and then the fact those men went,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
that the regional situation improved,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
that the European Union could offer Bosnia

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
something extraordinary:

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
the chance to be part

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
of a new thing, a new club,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
a chance to join something bigger.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
a lot of the secret of what we did,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
a lot of the secret of our success,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
was our humility --

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
was the tentative nature of our engagement.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
for being quite slow to take on war criminals.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
We criticized them

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
for being quite slow to return refugees.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
But that slowness, that caution,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
the fact that President Clinton initially said

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
that American troops would only be deployed for a year,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
turned out to be a strength,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
and it helped us to put our priorities right.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
One of the saddest things

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
about our involvement in Afghanistan

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is that we've got our priorities out of sync.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
We're not matching our resources to our priorities.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
If what we're interested in is regional stability,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Egypt is far more important.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
If what we're worried about is poverty and development,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
but that it's one of 40 countries in the world

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
with which we need to engage.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.260
So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
what we need to think of

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
is something like mountain rescue.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Why mountain rescue?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Because when people talk about intervention,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
they imagine that some scientific theory --

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
the Rand Corporation goes around

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
counting 43 previous insurgencies

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
producing mathematical formula

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
saying you need one trained counter-insurgent

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
for every 20 members of the population.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
This is the wrong way of looking at it.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
When you're doing mountain rescue,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
you look for somebody who knows the terrain.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
It's about context.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
You understand that you can prepare,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
but the amount of preparation you can do

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
is limited --

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
you can take some water, you can have a map,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
you can have a pack.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
But what really matters

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
is two kinds of problems --

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
problems that occur on the mountain

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
which you couldn't anticipate,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
such as, for example, ice on a slope,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
but which you can get around,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and problems which you couldn't anticipate

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and which you can't get around,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
or a change in the weather.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
And the key to this

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
is a guide who has been on that mountain,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
in every temperature,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
at every period --

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
a guide who, above all,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
knows when to turn back,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
who doesn't press on relentlessly

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
when conditions turn against them.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
What we look for

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and what we should look for in intervention,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
is intelligent risk takers --

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
not people who plunge blind off a cliff,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
not people who jump into a burning room,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
but who weigh their risks,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
weigh their responsibilities.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
is this idea

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
that failure is not an option.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
It makes failure invisible,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
inconceivable and inevitable.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
And if we can resist

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
this crazy slogan,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
we shall discover --

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
and anywhere else we go in the world --

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
that if we can often do much less than we pretend,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.260
we can do much more than we fear.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
(Applause)

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.260
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:34.260
(Applause)

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Thank you.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
Thank you.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
(Applause)

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
and the intervention?

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
The problem in Libya

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
is that we are always pushing for the black or white.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
We imagine there are only two choices:

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
either full engagement and troop deployment

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
or total isolation.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
And we are always being tempted up to our neck.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
What we should have done in Libya

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
We could have done that.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
because Gaddafi had no planes

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
within 48 hours.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
towards regime change.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.260
In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
which means it's very difficult

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
to get a resolution on Syria,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260
and we're setting ourselves up again for failure.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
Once more, humility,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
limits, honesty,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
realistic expectations

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
and we could have achieved something to be proud of.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
BG: Rory, thank you very much.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.)
