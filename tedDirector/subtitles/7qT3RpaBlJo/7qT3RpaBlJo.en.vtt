00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:15.327
Good morning.

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.114
When I was a little boy,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.191
I had an experience that changed my life,

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.099
and is in fact why I'm here today.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.040
That one moment

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.302
profoundly affected how I think about

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:30.523
art, design and engineering.

00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:33.280
As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.993
in a family of loving and talented artists

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:39.557
in one of the world's great cities.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:43.434
My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:46.964
was an artist by both passion and profession,

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:49.224
as is my mom, Rae.

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:51.029
He was one of the New York School

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:52.790
abstract expressionists who,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.302
together with his contemporaries,

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:58.200
invented American modern art,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.385
and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:05.928
towards modernism in the 20th century.

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:08.849
Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:12.490
of people doing mostly representational art,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.523
that modern art, comparatively speaking,

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:16.863
is about 15 minutes old,

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:18.761
yet now pervasive.

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.705
As with many other important innovations,

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.325
those radical ideas required no new technology,

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.218
just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:31.386
plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:32.840
and rejection.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.357
In our home, art was everywhere.

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:36.928
It was like oxygen,

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.090
around us and necessary for life.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.949
As I watched him paint,

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:44.256
Dad taught me that art

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.465
was not about being decorative,

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:49.579
but was a different way of communicating ideas,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.616
and in fact one that could bridge the worlds

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:54.544
of knowledge and insight.

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:56.684
Given this rich artistic environment,

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:58.299
you'd assume that I would have been compelled

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.408
to go into the family business,

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.024
but no.

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:04.811
I followed the path of most kids

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:06.161
who are genetically programmed

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.360
to make their parents crazy.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.983
I had no interest in becoming an artist,

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:12.543
certainly not a painter.

00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:15.842
What I did love was electronics and machines --

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.462
taking them apart, building new ones,

00:02:17.462 --> 00:02:19.349
and making them work.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.251
Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.459
and with my parents,

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.087
these were my first role models.

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:28.444
What they all had in common

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:31.152
was they worked very, very hard.

00:02:31.152 --> 00:02:33.522
My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:36.222
kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.646
On weekends, we would go
together to Cortlandt Street,

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:42.321
which was New York City's radio row.

00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.124
There we would explore massive piles

00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:46.345
of surplus electronics,

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:48.647
and for a few bucks bring home treasures

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.079
like Norden bombsights

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.590
and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.656
I found these objects both useful and fascinating.

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:00.287
I learned about engineering and how things worked,

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:01.747
not at school

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.536
but by taking apart and studying

00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:06.013
these fabulously complex devices.

00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.597
I did this for hours every day,

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:11.895
apparently avoiding electrocution.

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:13.467
Life was good.

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:15.788
However, every summer, sadly,

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:17.821
the machines got left behind

00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:20.025
while my parents and I traveled overseas

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:23.665
to experience history, art and design.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.059
We visited the great museums and historic buildings

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.919
of both Europe and the Middle East,

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.179
but to encourage my growing interest

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.994
in science and technology,

00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:34.278
they would simply drop me off in places

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:36.718
like the London Science Museum,

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:40.436
where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:44.412
studying the history of science and technology.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:47.676
Then, when I was about nine years old,

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.544
we went to Rome.

00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:51.905
On one particularly hot summer day,

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:54.784
we visited a drum-shaped
building that from the outside

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:57.028
was not particularly interesting.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.353
My dad said it was called the Pantheon,

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:01.821
a temple for all of the gods.

00:04:01.821 --> 00:04:04.095
It didn't look all that special from the outside,

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.534
as I said, but when we walked inside,

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:09.847
I was immediately struck by three things:

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:13.077
First of all, it was pleasantly cool

00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:15.155
despite the oppressive heat outside.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.869
It was very dark, the only source of light

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:20.342
being an big open hole in the roof.

00:04:20.342 --> 00:04:22.575
Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:24.389
but it was called the oculus,

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.765
an eye to the heavens.

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.910
And there was something about this place,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.913
I didn't know why, that just felt special.

00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:33.911
As we walked to the center of the room,

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:36.732
I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.

00:04:36.732 --> 00:04:39.029
This was the first church that I'd been to

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.232
that provided an unrestricted view

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:44.390
between God and man.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.820
But I wondered, what about when it rained?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.677
Dad may have called this an oculus,

00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.764
but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.

00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:54.593
I looked down and saw floor drains

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:57.178
had been cut into the stone floor.

00:04:57.178 --> 00:04:59.637
As I became more accustomed to the dark,

00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:01.901
I was able to make out details of the floor

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.631
and the surrounding walls.

00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:06.208
No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:08.124
that we'd seen all over Rome.

00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:09.796
In fact, it looked like the Appian Way

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:11.992
marble salesman showed up

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:14.440
with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.080
and Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it."

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.786
(Laughter)

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:22.004
But the ceiling was amazing.

00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:24.840
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.149
I'd seen these before,

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:28.393
and Bucky was friends with my dad.

00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:31.884
It was modern, high-tech, impressive,

00:05:31.884 --> 00:05:34.321
a huge 142-foot clear span

00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.564
which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.

00:05:37.564 --> 00:05:38.826
I loved this place.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:42.245
It was really beautiful and unlike
anything I'd ever seen before,

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:45.815
so I asked my dad, "When was this built?"

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:48.947
He said, "About 2,000 years ago."

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.451
And I said, "No, I mean, the roof."

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.410
You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.328
that had been put on because the original

00:05:55.328 --> 00:05:58.874
was destroyed in some long-past war.

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:02.336
He said, "It's the original roof."

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:04.814
That moment changed my life,

00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:07.463
and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:10.058
For the first time, I realized people were smart

00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:12.198
2,000 years ago. (Laughter)

00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:14.312
This had never crossed my mind.

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:18.183
I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,

00:06:18.183 --> 00:06:20.111
we visited those the year before,

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.031
and sure they're impressive, nice enough design,

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.486
but look, give me an unlimited budget,

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:29.483
20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years

00:06:29.483 --> 00:06:33.099
to cut and drag stone blocks 
across the countryside,

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.863
and I'll build you pyramids too.

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.666
But no amount of brute force

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:41.708
gets you the dome of the Pantheon,

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.727
not 2,000 years ago, nor today.

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:47.467
And incidentally, it is still the largest

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:51.281
unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.

00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:54.276
To build the Pantheon took some miracles.

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:56.708
By miracles, I mean things that are

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.295
technically barely possible,

00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:02.367
very high-risk, and might not be

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.951
actually accomplishable at this moment in time,

00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:09.203
certainly not by you.

00:07:09.203 --> 00:07:12.328
For example, here are some
of the Pantheon's miracles.

00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:15.021
To make it even structurally possible,

00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.588
they had to invent super-strong concrete,

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:19.537
and to control weight,

00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:21.605
varied the density of the aggregate

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:24.373
as they worked their way up the dome.

00:07:24.373 --> 00:07:26.674
For strength and lightness, the dome structure

00:07:26.674 --> 00:07:28.711
used five rings of coffers,

00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:30.318
each of diminishing size,

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:33.054
which imparts a dramatic forced perspective

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:35.061
to the design.

00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.986
It was wonderfully cool inside

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:39.169
because of its huge thermal mass,

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:41.254
natural convection of air rising up

00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:42.655
through the oculus,

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:45.130
and a Venturi effect when wind blows across

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.433
the top of the building.

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:51.393
I discovered for the first time that light itself

00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:53.360
has substance.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.037
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus

00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:58.527
was both beautiful and palpable,

00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:00.784
and I realized for the first time

00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:02.685
that light could be designed.

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:07.559
Further, that of all of the forms of design,

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:08.935
visual design,

00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:10.766
they were all kind of irrelevant without it,

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:14.627
because without light, you can't see any of them.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:17.079
I also realized that I wasn't the first person

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:20.338
to think that this place was really special.

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:24.715
It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers

00:08:24.715 --> 00:08:26.614
and the ravages of time to become

00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:27.994
what I believe is the longest

00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:30.951
continuously occupied building in history.

00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:33.167
Largely because of that visit,

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:34.704
I came to understand that,

00:08:34.704 --> 00:08:37.343
contrary to what I was being told in school,

00:08:37.343 --> 00:08:39.372
the worlds of art and design

00:08:39.372 --> 00:08:41.388
were not, in fact, incompatible

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:43.064
with science and engineering.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.157
I realized, when combined,

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:47.920
you could create things that were amazing

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.766
that couldn't be done in either domain alone.

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:53.199
But in school, with few exceptions,

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.119
they were treated as separate worlds,

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:57.262
and they still are.

00:08:57.262 --> 00:08:59.958
My teachers told me that I had to get serious

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.131
and focus on one or the other.

00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.226
However, urging me to specialize

00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:08.536
only caused me to really 
appreciate those polymaths

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:12.686
like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:14.111
Benjamin Franklin,

00:09:14.111 --> 00:09:16.821
people who did exactly the opposite.

00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:19.010
And this led me to embrace

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.980
and want to be in both worlds.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.808
So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.302
like the Pantheon actually happen?

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:34.230
Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.421
needed a brilliant creative vision.

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:40.214
They also needed the storytelling
and leadership skills

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:42.992
necessary to fund and execute it,

00:09:42.992 --> 00:09:45.854
and a mastery of science and technology

00:09:45.854 --> 00:09:47.937
with the ability and knowhow

00:09:47.937 --> 00:09:51.983
to push existing innovations even farther.

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:55.903
It is my belief that to create
these rare game changers

00:09:55.903 --> 00:10:00.033
requires you to pull off at least five miracles.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.726
The problem is, no matter how talented,

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:04.458
rich or smart you are,

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.484
you only get one to one and a half miracles.

00:10:07.484 --> 00:10:09.266
That's it. That's the quota.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:11.879
Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.258
whatever.

00:10:13.258 --> 00:10:15.535
Remember, most people can't even imagine

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:17.442
one of these technical miracles,

00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:20.551
and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.

00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.052
In my experience, these rare visionaries

00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:24.889
who can think across the worlds of art,

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:26.716
design and engineering

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:28.918
have the ability to notice

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:31.635
when others have provided enough of the miracles

00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:34.191
to bring the goal within reach.

00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:36.828
Driven by the clarity of their vision,

00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:39.138
they summon the courage and determination

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.235
to deliver the remaining miracles

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:44.785
and they often take what other people think to be

00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:46.831
insurmountable obstacles

00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.616
and turn them into features.

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:51.543
Take the oculus of the Pantheon.

00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:53.441
By insisting that it be in the design,

00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:56.314
it meant you couldn't use much
of the structural technology

00:10:56.314 --> 00:10:59.288
that had been developed for Roman arches.

00:10:59.288 --> 00:11:02.186
However, by instead embracing it

00:11:02.186 --> 00:11:04.774
and rethinking weight and stress distribution,

00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:07.256
they came up with a design that only works

00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:09.160
if there's a big hole in the roof.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.167
That done, you now get the aesthetic

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:16.548
and design benefits of light, cooling

00:11:16.548 --> 00:11:19.848
and that critical direct connection with the heavens.

00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:21.892
Not bad.

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:23.953
These people not only believed

00:11:23.953 --> 00:11:26.009
that the impossible can be done,

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:28.835
but that it must be done.

00:11:28.835 --> 00:11:30.936
Enough ancient history.

00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:34.069
What are some recent examples of innovations

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:35.948
that combine creative design

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:39.191
and technological advances in a way so profound

00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:40.520
that they will be remembered

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.353
a thousand years from now?

00:11:42.353 --> 00:11:45.449
Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:48.466
and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.958
Talk about one giant leap:

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.406
It's hard to imagine a more profound moment

00:11:53.406 --> 00:11:54.718
in human history

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:56.891
than when we first left our world

00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:58.782
to set foot on another.

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:01.003
So what came after the moon?

00:12:01.003 --> 00:12:03.811
One is tempted to say that today's pantheon

00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:05.472
is the Internet,

00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:07.941
but I actually think that's quite wrong,

00:12:07.941 --> 00:12:10.796
or at least it's only part of the story.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.312
The Internet isn't a Pantheon.

00:12:13.312 --> 00:12:15.903
It's more like the invention of concrete:

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:18.478
important, absolutely necessary

00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:19.918
to build the Pantheon,

00:12:19.918 --> 00:12:21.274
and enduring,

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:24.465
but entirely insufficient by itself.

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:27.397
However, just as the technology of concrete

00:12:27.397 --> 00:12:30.984
was critical in realization of the Pantheon,

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:34.199
new designers will use the
technologies of the Internet

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:37.397
to create novel concepts that will endure.

00:12:37.397 --> 00:12:39.455
The smartphone is a perfect example.

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:41.200
Soon the majority of people on the planet

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.534
will have one,

00:12:42.534 --> 00:12:44.935
and the idea of connecting everyone

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:48.185
to both knowledge and each other will endure.

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.493
So what's next?

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:52.899
What imminent advance will be
the equivalent of the Pantheon?

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:54.334
Thinking about this,

00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:56.881
I rejected many very plausible

00:12:56.881 --> 00:12:58.777
and dramatic breakthroughs to come,

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.794
such as curing cancer.

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:04.132
Why? Because Pantheons are anchored

00:13:04.132 --> 00:13:07.067
in designed physical objects,

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:09.389
ones that inspire by simply seeing

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:10.809
and experiencing them,

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.691
and will continue to do so indefinitely.

00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:18.264
It is a different kind of language, like art.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:21.036
These other vital contributions that extend life

00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:23.729
and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,

00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:25.416
and fantastic,

00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:27.209
but they're part of the continuum of

00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.721
our overall knowledge and technology,

00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:32.245
like the Internet.

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:34.589
So what is next?

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:36.308
Perhaps counterintuitively,

00:13:36.308 --> 00:13:38.620
I'm guessing it's a visionary idea

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.474
from the late 1930s

00:13:40.474 --> 00:13:43.634
that's been revived every decade since:

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:45.648
autonomous vehicles.

00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:47.386
Now you're thinking, give me a break.

00:13:47.386 --> 00:13:50.904
How can a fancy version of cruise control

00:13:50.904 --> 00:13:52.604
be profound?

00:13:52.604 --> 00:13:54.728
Look, much of our world

00:13:54.728 --> 00:13:58.211
has been designed around 
roads and transportation.

00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:00.086
These were as essential to the success

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:01.584
of the Roman Empire

00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:03.569
as the interstate highway system

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:05.363
to the prosperity and development

00:14:05.363 --> 00:14:07.573
of the United States.

00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:10.607
Today, these roads that interconnect our world

00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:12.705
are dominated by cars and trucks

00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:14.573
that have remained largely unchanged

00:14:14.573 --> 00:14:17.144
for 100 years.

00:14:17.144 --> 00:14:20.403
Although perhaps not obvious today,

00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:24.988
autonomous vehicles will be the key technology

00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:28.086
that enables us to redesign our cities

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:30.305
and, by extension, civilization.

00:14:30.305 --> 00:14:31.907
Here's why:

00:14:31.907 --> 00:14:33.660
Once they become ubiquitous,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.197
each year, these vehicles will save

00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:39.305
tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone

00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:42.432
and a million globally.

00:14:42.432 --> 00:14:45.331
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.704
will be cut dramatically.

00:14:47.704 --> 00:14:49.109
Much of the road congestion

00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:52.919
in and out of our cities will disappear.

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:55.606
They will enable compelling new concepts

00:14:55.606 --> 00:14:58.075
in how we design cities, work,

00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:00.012
and the way we live.

00:15:00.012 --> 00:15:02.558
We will get where we're going faster

00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:05.556
and society will recapture vast amounts

00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:06.847
of lost productivity

00:15:06.847 --> 00:15:10.488
now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.

00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:13.761
But why now? Why do we think this is ready?

00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.955
Because over the last 30 years,

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:18.003
people from outside the automotive industry

00:15:18.003 --> 00:15:20.111
have spent countless billions

00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:21.846
creating the needed miracles,

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:24.718
but for entirely different purposes.

00:15:24.718 --> 00:15:27.346
It took folks like DARPA, universities,

00:15:27.346 --> 00:15:30.510
and companies completely
outside of the automotive industry

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.811
to notice that if you were clever about it,

00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:35.341
autonomy could be done now.

00:15:35.341 --> 00:15:38.724
So what are the five miracles
needed for autonomous vehicles?

00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:40.367
One, you need to know

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:43.101
where you are and exactly what time it is.

00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.509
This was solved neatly by the GPS system,

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:46.821
Global Positioning System,

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.487
that the U.S. Government put in place.

00:15:49.487 --> 00:15:52.010
You need to know where all the roads are,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.913
what the rules are, and where you're going.

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:57.496
The various needs of personal navigation systems,

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.251
in-car navigation systems,

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:02.284
and web-based maps address this.

00:16:02.284 --> 00:16:04.911
You must have near-continuous communication

00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:06.804
with high-performance computing networks

00:16:06.804 --> 00:16:08.474
and with others nearby

00:16:08.474 --> 00:16:11.789
to understand their intent.

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:14.897
The wireless technologies
developed for mobile devices,

00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:16.690
with some minor modifications,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.649
are completely suitable to solve this.

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:22.139
You'll probably want some restricted roadways

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:23.329
to get started

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:25.807
that both society and its lawyers

00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:27.679
agree are safe to use for this.

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.528
This will start with the HOV lanes

00:16:29.528 --> 00:16:31.661
and move from there.

00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:34.212
But finally, you need to recognize

00:16:34.212 --> 00:16:36.315
people, signs and objects.

00:16:36.315 --> 00:16:39.369
Machine vision, special sensors,
and high-performance computing

00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:40.941
can do a lot of this,

00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:43.499
but it turns out a lot is not good enough

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:45.440
when your family is on board.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.961
Occasionally, humans will 
need to do sense-making.

00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:52.573
For this, you might actually have to wake up

00:16:52.573 --> 00:16:54.669
your passenger and ask them what the hell

00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:57.471
that big lump is in the middle of the road.

00:16:57.487 --> 00:16:59.831
Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose

00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:01.684
in this new world.

00:17:01.684 --> 00:17:04.424
Besides, once the first drivers explain

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:05.750
to their confused car

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.416
that the giant chicken at the fork in the road

00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:09.959
is actually a restaurant,

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.263
and it's okay to keep driving,

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:15.683
every other car on the surface of the Earth

00:17:15.683 --> 00:17:18.605
will know that from that point on.

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.868
Five miracles, mostly delivered,

00:17:20.868 --> 00:17:22.746
and now you just need a clear vision

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:25.583
of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles

00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:29.196
with seductively beautiful 
and new functional designs

00:17:29.196 --> 00:17:31.650
plus a lot of money and hard work

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.246
to bring it home.

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:36.268
The beginning is now only a handful of years away,

00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:38.136
and I predict that autonomous vehicles

00:17:38.136 --> 00:17:40.207
will permanently change our world

00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:44.391
over the next several decades.

00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:47.043
In conclusion, I've come to believe

00:17:47.043 --> 00:17:49.281
that the ingredients for the next Pantheons

00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:50.668
are all around us,

00:17:50.668 --> 00:17:52.855
just waiting for visionary people

00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:54.589
with the broad knowledge,

00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.199
multidisciplinary skills,

00:17:56.199 --> 00:17:58.067
and intense passion

00:17:58.067 --> 00:18:03.153
to harness them to make their dreams a reality.

00:18:03.153 --> 00:18:05.649
But these people don't spontaneously

00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:06.988
pop into existence.

00:18:06.988 --> 00:18:08.827
They need to be nurtured and encouraged

00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:10.606
from when they're little kids.

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:12.466
We need to love them and help them

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.185
discover their passions.

00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:16.399
We need to encourage them to work hard

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:18.836
and help them understand that failure

00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:21.707
is a necessary ingredient for success,

00:18:21.707 --> 00:18:23.888
as is perseverance.

00:18:23.888 --> 00:18:26.986
We need to help them to find their own role models,

00:18:26.986 --> 00:18:29.658
and give them the confidence
to believe in themselves

00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:32.435
and to believe that anything is possible,

00:18:32.435 --> 00:18:35.944
and just as my grandpa did when
he took me shopping for surplus,

00:18:35.944 --> 00:18:37.727
and just as my parents did

00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:39.749
when they took me to science museums,

00:18:39.749 --> 00:18:43.030
we need to encourage them to find their own path,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.687
even if it's very different from our own.

00:18:45.687 --> 00:18:47.095
But a cautionary note:

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:49.529
We also need to periodically pry them away

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:50.998
from their modern miracles,

00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:52.969
the computers, phones, tablets,

00:18:52.969 --> 00:18:54.563
game machines and TVs,

00:18:54.563 --> 00:18:56.807
take them out into the sunlight

00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:58.936
so they can experience both the natural

00:18:58.936 --> 00:19:01.833
and design wonders of our world,

00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:04.075
our planet and our civilization.

00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:07.002
If we don't, they won't understand

00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:08.884
what these precious things are

00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:11.479
that someday they will be resopnsible

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:13.761
for protecting and improving.

00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.404
We also need them to understand

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.433
something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated

00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:20.896
in our increasingly tech-dependent world,

00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:22.579
that art and design

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.492
are not luxuries,

00:19:24.492 --> 00:19:26.318
nor somehow incompatible

00:19:26.318 --> 00:19:28.187
with science and engineering.

00:19:28.187 --> 00:19:33.762
They are in fact essential to what makes us special.

00:19:33.762 --> 00:19:36.277
Someday, if you get the chance,

00:19:36.277 --> 00:19:37.814
perhaps you can take your kids

00:19:37.814 --> 00:19:39.585
to the actual Pantheon,

00:19:39.585 --> 00:19:42.245
as we will our daughter Kira,

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:44.323
to experience firsthand

00:19:44.323 --> 00:19:48.580
the power of that astonishing design,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.324
which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome,

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.351
reached 2,000 years into the future

00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:58.009
to set the course for my life.

00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:00.140
Thank you.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.448
(Applause)
