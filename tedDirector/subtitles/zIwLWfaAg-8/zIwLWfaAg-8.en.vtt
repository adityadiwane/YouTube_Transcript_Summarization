Chris Anderson:
Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.756
It's great to have you here.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.356
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.236
CA: So, in the next half hour or so,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.076
we're going to spend some time

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.996
exploring your vision for what
an exciting future might look like,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.116
which I guess makes
the first question a little ironic:

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.876
Why are you boring?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.116
EM: Yeah.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.690
I ask myself that frequently.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.196
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.396
and this is to create the beginning

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.540
of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.556
to alleviate congestion.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.116
So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.996
It affects people
in every part of the world.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.836
It takes away so much of your life.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.836
It's horrible.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.476
It's particularly horrible in LA.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.156
(Laughter)

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.116
CA: I think you've brought with you

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.595
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.956
Can I show this?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.676
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time --

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.556
Just to show what we're talking about.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.716
So a couple of key things
that are important

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.636
in having a 3D tunnel network.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.276
First of all, you have to be able

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.556
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.636
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.316
So by having an elevator,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.116
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.076
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340
just by using two parking spaces.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.756
And then the car gets on a skate.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.156
There's no speed limit here,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.196
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.436
CA: How much?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.780
EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.836
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.116
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.476
(Applause)

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.076
CA: So possibly, initially done,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.396
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.636
EM: Yeah.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.716
CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.436
from the surface streets as well.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.076
EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.236
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.076
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.276
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.556
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.876
with a 3D tunnel network.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.436
This is a very important point.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.836
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.636
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.956
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.396
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.756
any number of levels.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.316
CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.116
and that would block this idea.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.836
EM: Yeah.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.076
Well, they're right.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.876
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.556
which is -- I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.819
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:29.236
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.236
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.756
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.956
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.300
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.660
CA: And how could you achieve that?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.116
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.476
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.676
and I think you can go beyond that.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.956
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.596
by a factor of two or more.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.596
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.476
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.676
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.956
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.556
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.236
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.476
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.396
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.276
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.516
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.436
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.636
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.956
for the tunnel wall.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.196
So if you design the machine instead

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.556
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.796
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.036
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.716
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.796
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.956
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.156
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.396
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.396
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.156
in the cost per mile,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.116
and our target actually is --

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.956
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.516
this is from Gary the snail
from "South Park,"

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.476
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.076
(Laughter)

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.516
So Gary is capable of --

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.636
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.436
than a tunnel-boring machine.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.236
(Laughter)

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.036
CA: You want to beat Gary.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.356
EM: We want to beat Gary.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.916
(Laughter)

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.156
He's not a patient little fellow,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.276
and that will be victory.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.700
Victory is beating the snail.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.156
CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.076
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.316
You go aboveground.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.156
Why isn't that a better solution?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.156
You save all that tunneling cost.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.396
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.276
Obviously, I do rockets,
so I like things that fly.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.236
This is not some inherent bias
against flying things,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.316
but there is a challenge with flying cars

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.636
in that they'll be quite noisy,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.220
the wind force generated
will be very high.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.516
Let's just say that if something's
flying over your head,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.100
a whole bunch of flying cars
going all over the place,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.876
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.220
(Laughter)

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.580
You don't think to yourself,
"Well, I feel better about today."

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.956
You're thinking,
"Did they service their hubcap,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.876
or is it going to come off
and guillotine me?"

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.580
Things like that.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.716
CA: So you've got this vision

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.036
of future cities with these rich,
3D networks of tunnels underneath.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.076
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.636
Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.041
you released a few years ago.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.876
EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.516
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.356
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.516
just for a student competition,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.556
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.596
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.540
after the Large Hadron Collider,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.820
by volume.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.596
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.316
and then we think we might --

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.700
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.196
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.649
if it's not pushing something.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.876
So we're cautiously optimistic

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.916
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.196
even in a .8-mile stretch.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.756
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.036
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.676
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.276
CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.116
running quite long distances.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.836
EM: Exactly.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.636
And looking at tunneling technology,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.196
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.420
you have to --

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.516
In order to seal against the water table,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.196
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.540
to about five or six atmospheres.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:49.996
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.436
or near-vacuum.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.876
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.876
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.316
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.956
CA: Huh.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.516
EM: So, yeah.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.396
CA: And so you could actually picture,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:13.116
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.356
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.396
You could dig as much as you want.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.636
I think if you were to do something

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.836
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.716
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.356
because it's a high-density area.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.436
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.996
and if you go deep enough,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.396
you cannot detect the tunnel.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.356
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.236
to have a tunnel dug under my house.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.596
Like, if that tunnel is dug

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.796
more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.700
you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:59.396
In fact, if you're able
to detect the tunnel being dug,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.036
whatever device you are using,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.326
you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.146
who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:12.236
and from the US Customs and Border patrol
that try and detect drug tunnels.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.476
So the reality is

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.356
that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.356
and once the tunnel depth
is below a certain level,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.356
it is undetectable.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.956
Maybe if you have a very sensitive
seismic instrument,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.460
you might be able to detect it.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.476
CA: So you've started
a new company to do this

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.196
called The Boring Company.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.156
Very nice. Very funny.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.556
(Laughter)

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.076
EM: What's funny about that?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.716
(Laughter)

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.660
CA: How much of your time is this?

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.540
EM: It's maybe ...

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.700
two or three percent.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.556
CA: You've bought a hobby.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.316
This is what an Elon Musk
hobby looks like.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.356
(Laughter)

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.836
EM: I mean, it really is, like --

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.740
This is basically interns
and people doing it part time.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.836
We bought some second-hand machinery.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.980
It's kind of puttering along,
but it's making good progress, so --

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.716
CA: So an even bigger part of your time

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.020
is being spent on electrifying
cars and transport through Tesla.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.836
Is one of the motivations
for the tunneling project

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.396
the realization that actually,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.836
in a world where cars are electric
and where they're self-driving,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.396
there may end up being
more cars on the roads

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.796
on any given hour than there are now?

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.740
EM: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.156
A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.796
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.716
And to some degree that will be true,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.796
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.260
and you can go point to point,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.916
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.156
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.236
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.116
and actually traffic will get far worse.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.396
CA: You started Tesla
with the goal of persuading the world

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.556
that electrification
was the future of cars,

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.956
and a few years ago,
people were laughing at you.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.436
Now, not so much.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.676
EM: OK.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.636
(Laughter)

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.876
I don't know. I don't know.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.316
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
every auto manufacturer

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.356
has announced
serious electrification plans

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.020
for the short- to medium-term future?

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.020
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.076
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.356
They vary in seriousness.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.676
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.060
and some are just dabbling in it.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.516
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.676
but I think that won't last much longer.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.756
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.476
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, "We did it."

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.580
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.540
EM: Yeah.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.716
I intend to stay with Tesla
as far into the future as I can imagine,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.396
and there are a lot of exciting
things that we have coming.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.596
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.020
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.876
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.876
So Model 3, it's supposed
to be coming in July-ish.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.436
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.836
CA: Wow.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.236
One of the things
that people are so excited about

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.476
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.836
And you put out this video a while back

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.196
showing what that technology
would look like.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.436
EM: Yeah.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.946
CA: There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.356
What are we seeing here?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:09.396
EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.916
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.980
This is just using passive optical,
which is essentially what a person uses.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.516
The whole road system
is meant to be navigated

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.596
with passive optical, or cameras,

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.956
and so once you solve cameras

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.220
or vision,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.036
then autonomy is solved.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.340
If you don't solve vision,
it's not solved.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.956
So that's why our focus is
so heavily on having a vision neural net

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.196
that's very effective for road conditions.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.836
CA: Right. Many other people
are going the LIDAR route.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.716
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.116
EM: You can absolutely
be superhuman with just cameras.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.156
Like, you can probably do it
ten times better than humans would,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.436
just cameras.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.916
CA: So the new cars being sold right now
have eight cameras in them.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.276
They can't yet do what that showed.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.940
When will they be able to?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.996
EM: I think we're still on track
for being able to go cross-country

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.196
from LA to New York by the end
of the year, fully autonomous.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.996
CA: OK, so by the end
of the year, you're saying,

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.996
someone's going to sit in a Tesla
without touching the steering wheel,

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.516
tap in "New York," off it goes.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.756
EM: Yeah.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.980
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --
by the end of 2017.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.716
EM: Yeah. Essentially,
November or December of this year,

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.156
we should be able to go all the way
from a parking lot in California

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.836
to a parking lot in New York,

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.700
no controls touched at any point
during the entire journey.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.636
(Applause)

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.876
CA: Amazing.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.316
But part of that is possible

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.756
because you've already got a fleet
of Teslas driving all these roads.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.580
You're accumulating a huge amount
of data of that national road system.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.916
EM: Yes, but the thing
that will be interesting

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:11.020
is that I'm actually fairly confident
it will be able to do that route

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.020
even if you change the route dynamically.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.060
So, it's fairly easy --

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.596
If you say I'm going to be really good
at one specific route, that's one thing,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.756
but it should be able to go,
really be very good,

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.516
certainly once you enter a highway,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.316
to go anywhere on the highway system

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.580
in a given country.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.156
So it's not sort of limited
to LA to New York.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.636
We could change it
and make it Seattle-Florida,

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.196
that day, in real time.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.356
So you were going from LA to New York.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.100
Now go from LA to Toronto.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.876
CA: So leaving aside
regulation for a second,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.676
in terms of the technology alone,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.516
the time when someone
will be able to buy one of your cars

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.356
and literally just take the hands
off the wheel and go to sleep

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.436
and wake up and find that they've arrived,

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.396
how far away is that, to do that safely?

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.676
EM: I think that's about two years.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.076
So the real trick of it
is not how do you make it work

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.035
say 99.9 percent of the time,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.156
because, like, if a car crashes
one in a thousand times,

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:24.156
then you're probably still not going
to be comfortable falling asleep.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.860
You shouldn't be, certainly.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.360
(Laughter)

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.755
It's never going to be perfect.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.515
No system is going to be perfect,

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.139
but if you say it's perhaps --

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.756
the car is unlikely to crash

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.236
in a hundred lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.156
then people are like, OK, wow,
if I were to live a thousand lives,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.796
I would still most likely
never experience a crash,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.196
then that's probably OK.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.436
CA: To sleep.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.316
I guess the big concern of yours
is that people may actually

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.636
get seduced too early
to think that this is safe,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.196
and that you'll have some horrible
incident happen that puts things back.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:11.236
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
is likely to at least mitigate the crash,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.740
except in rare circumstances.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.396
The thing to appreciate
about vehicle safety

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.820
is this is probabilistic.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.196
I mean, there's some chance that any time
a human driver gets in a car,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.156
that they will have an accident
that is their fault.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.500
It's never zero.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.636
So really the key threshold for autonomy

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.076
is how much better does autonomy
need to be than a person

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.476
before you can rely on it?

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.916
CA: But once you get
literally safe hands-off driving,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.756
the power to disrupt
the whole industry seems massive,

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.156
because at that point you've spoken
of people being able to buy a car,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.316
drops you off at work,
and then you let it go

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.316
and provide a sort of Uber-like
service to other people,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.556
earn you money,

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.036
maybe even cover the cost
of your lease of that car,

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.916
so you can kind of get a car for free.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.196
Is that really likely?

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.076
EM: Yeah. Absolutely
this is what will happen.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.076
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.356
where you buy your car

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.796
and you can choose
to use that car exclusively,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.516
you could choose to have it be used
only by friends and family,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.596
only by other drivers
who are rated five star,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.500
you can choose to share it sometimes
but not other times.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.236
That's 100 percent what will occur.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.641
It's just a question of when.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.996
CA: Wow.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.236
So you mentioned the Semi

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.996
and I think you're planning
to announce this in September,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.116
but I'm curious whether there's
anything you could show us today?

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.996
EM: I will show you
a teaser shot of the truck.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.516
(Laughter)

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.476
It's alive.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.716
CA: OK.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.436
EM: That's definitely a case
where we want to be cautious

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.794
about the autonomy features.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.396
Yeah.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.036
(Laughter)

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.676
CA: We can't see that much of it,

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.916
but it doesn't look like
just a little friendly neighborhood truck.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.196
It looks kind of badass.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.380
What sort of semi is this?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.556
EM: So this is a heavy duty,
long-range semitruck.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.836
So it's the highest weight capability

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.916
and with long range.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.380
So essentially it's meant to alleviate
the heavy-duty trucking loads.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:34.396
And this is something which
people do not today think is possible.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.156
They think the truck doesn't have enough
power or it doesn't have enough range,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.716
and then with the Tesla Semi

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.396
we want to show that no, an electric truck

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:49.436
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.596
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.676
the Tesla Semi
will tug the diesel semi uphill.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.956
(Laughter)

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.836
(Applause)

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.876
CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.220
These are going to be trucks
that truck drivers want to drive.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.916
EM: Yes. So what will be
really fun about this

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.316
is you have a flat torque RPM curve
with an electric motor,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.836
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
of internal combustion engine car,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.460
you've got a torque RPM curve
that looks like a hill.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.596
So this will be a very spry truck.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.476
You can drive this
around like a sports car.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.876
There's no gears.
It's, like, single speed.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.356
CA: There's a great movie
to be made here somewhere.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.156
I don't know what it is
and I don't know that it ends well,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.396
but it's a great movie.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.436
(Laughter)

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.196
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.236
When I was driving the test prototype
for the first truck.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.516
It's really weird,
because you're driving around

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.636
and you're just so nimble,
and you're in this giant truck.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.156
CA: Wait, you've
already driven a prototype?

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.276
EM: Yeah, I drove it
around the parking lot,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.756
and I was like, this is crazy.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.956
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.076
EM: It's just like,
driving this giant truck

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.076
and making these mad maneuvers.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.556
CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.196
to a kind of less badass picture.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.556
This is just a cute house
from "Desperate Housewives" or something.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.636
What on earth is going on here?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.116
EM: Well, this illustrates
the picture of the future

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.116
that I think is how things will evolve.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.476
You've got an electric car
in the driveway.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.236
If you look in between
the electric car and the house,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.116
there are actually three Powerwalls
stacked up against the side of the house,

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.956
and then that house roof is a solar roof.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.076
So that's an actual solar glass roof.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.316
CA: OK.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.596
EM: That's a picture of a real --
well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.276
That's a real fake house.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.396
(Laughter)

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.276
CA: So these roof tiles,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:57.436
some of them have in them
basically solar power, the ability to --

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.156
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:04.276
where you can adjust
the texture and the color

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.276
to a very fine-grained level,

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.876
and then there's
sort of microlouvers in the glass,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.356
such that when you're looking
at the roof from street level

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.076
or close to street level,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.476
all the tiles look the same

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.580
whether there is a solar cell
behind it or not.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.236
So you have an even color

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.756
from the ground level.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.876
If you were to look at it
from a helicopter,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.276
you would be actually able
to look through and see

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.316
that some of the glass tiles have
a solar cell behind them and some do not.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.956
You can't tell from street level.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.036
CA: You put them in the ones
that are likely to see a lot of sun,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.436
and that makes these roofs
super affordable, right?

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.436
They're not that much more expensive
than just tiling the roof.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.660
EM: Yeah.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.260
We're very confident
that the cost of the roof

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.580
plus the cost of electricity --

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.676
A solar glass roof will be less
than the cost of a normal roof

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.116
plus the cost of electricity.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.396
So in other words,

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.756
this will be economically a no-brainer,

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.476
we think it will look great,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.636
and it will last --

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.716
We thought about having
the warranty be infinity,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.956
but then people thought,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.556
well, that might sound
like were just talking rubbish,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:28.196
but actually this is toughened glass.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.116
Well after the house has collapsed

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.036
and there's nothing there,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.596
the glass tiles will still be there.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.196
(Applause)

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.956
CA: I mean, this is cool.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.836
So you're rolling this out
in a couple week's time, I think,

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.396
with four different roofing types.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.956
EM: Yeah, we're starting off
with two, two initially,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.156
and the second two
will be introduced early next year.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.236
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.780
How many houses do you believe
could end up having this type of roofing?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.980
EM: I think eventually

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.020
almost all houses will have a solar roof.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.236
The thing is to consider
the time scale here

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.716
to be probably on the order

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.916
of 40 or 50 years.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.820
So on average, a roof
is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.556
But you don't start replacing
all roofs immediately.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.916
But eventually,
if you say were to fast-forward

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.396
to say 15 years from now,

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.020
it will be unusual to have a roof
that does not have solar.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.516
CA: Is there a mental model thing
that people don't get here

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.956
that because of the shift in the cost,
the economics of solar power,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.076
most houses actually have
enough sunlight on their roof

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.156
pretty much to power all of their needs.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.076
If you could capture the power,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.156
it could pretty much
power all their needs.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.716
You could go off-grid, kind of.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.276
EM: It depends on where you are

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.556
and what the house size is
relative to the roof area,

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.436
but it's a fair statement to say

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.276
that most houses in the US
have enough roof area

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.260
to power all the needs of the house.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.796
CA: So the key to the economics

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.836
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.756
is the falling price
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.276
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.556
In many ways, that's almost
the core competency.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.836
And you've decided

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:35.076
that to really, like, own that competency,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.556
you just have to build
the world's largest manufacturing plant

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.716
to double the world's supply
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.036
with this guy. What is this?

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.516
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.236
progress so far on the Gigafactory.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.156
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.116
that there's sort of
a diamond shape overall,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.756
and when it's fully done,
it'll look like a giant diamond,

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.996
or that's the idea behind it,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.516
and it's aligned on true north.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.276
It's a small detail.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.196
CA: And capable of producing, eventually,

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.396
like a hundred gigawatt hours
of batteries a year.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.396
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
We think probably more, but yeah.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.796
CA: And they're actually
being produced right now.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.996
EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.356
I mean, is that speeded up?

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.076
EM: That's the slowed down version.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.876
(Laughter)

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.236
CA: How fast does it actually go?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.076
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.036
you can't actually see the cells
without a strobe light.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.260
It's just blur.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.696
(Laughter)

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.396
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
about what makes an exciting future

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.060
is a future where we no longer
feel guilty about energy.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.716
Help us picture this.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.756
How many Gigafactories, if you like,
does it take to get us there?

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.516
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.276
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.660
Most likely a hundred.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.516
CA: See, I find this amazing.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.516
You can picture what it would take

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.796
to move the world
off this vast fossil fuel thing.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.396
It's like you're building one,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.276
it costs five billion dollars,

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.436
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.076
Like, it's kind of cool
that you can picture that project.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.580
And you're planning to do, at Tesla --
announce another two this year.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.156
EM: I think we'll announce locations

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.916
for somewhere between two
and four Gigafactories later this year.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.380
Yeah, probably four.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.476
CA: Whoa.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.116
(Applause)

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.196
No more teasing from you for here?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.020
Like -- where, continent?

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.500
You can say no.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.036
EM: We need to address a global market.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.276
CA: OK.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.636
(Laughter)

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.860
This is cool.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.540
I think we should talk for --

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.996
Actually, double mark it.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.116
I'm going to ask you one question
about politics, only one.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.396
I'm kind of sick of politics,
but I do want to ask you this.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:19.756
You're on a body now
giving advice to a guy --

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.996
EM: Who?

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.916
CA: Who has said he doesn't
really believe in climate change,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.276
and there's a lot of people out there
who think you shouldn't be doing that.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.196
They'd like you to walk away from that.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.580
What would you say to them?

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.156
EM: Well, I think that first of all,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.716
I'm just on two advisory councils

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.556
where the format consists
of going around the room

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.476
and asking people's opinion on things,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.260
and so there's like a meeting
every month or two.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.596
That's the sum total of my contribution.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.396
But I think to the degree
that there are people in the room

00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.156
who are arguing in favor
of doing something about climate change,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.180
or social issues,

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.556
I've used the meetings I've had thus far

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.436
to argue in favor of immigration
and in favor of climate change.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.396
(Applause)

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.516
And if I hadn't done that,

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.356
that wasn't on the agenda before.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.620
So maybe nothing will happen,
but at least the words were said.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.716
CA: OK.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.620
(Applause)

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.156
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.636
Last time you were here,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.356
you spoke about what seemed like
a kind of incredibly ambitious dream

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.676
to develop rockets
that were actually reusable.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.836
And you've only gone and done it.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.476
EM: Finally. It took a long time.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.076
CA: Talk us through this.
What are we looking at here?

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.236
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.836
coming back from
very high and fast in space.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.116
So just delivered the upper stage

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.236
at high velocity.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.116
I think this might have been
at sort of Mach 7 or so,

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.100
delivery of the upper stage.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.700
(Applause)

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.156
CA: So that was a sped-up --

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.996
EM: That was the slowed down version.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.356
(Laughter)

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.876
CA: I thought that was
the sped-up version.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.236
But I mean, that's amazing,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.596
and several of these failed

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.556
before you finally
figured out how to do it,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.476
but now you've done this,
what, five or six times?

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.796
EM: We're at eight or nine.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.436
CA: And for the first time,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.596
you've actually reflown
one of the rockets that landed.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.396
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.036
and then prepped it for flight again
and flew it again,

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:47.236
so it's the first reflight
of an orbital booster

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.236
where that reflight is relevant.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.436
So it's important to appreciate
that reusability is only relevant

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.540
if it is rapid and complete.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.476
So like an aircraft or a car,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.876
the reusability is rapid and complete.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.956
You do not send your aircraft
to Boeing in-between flights.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.796
CA: Right. So this is allowing you
to dream of this really ambitious idea

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.996
of sending many, many, many people to Mars

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.436
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.836
EM: Yeah.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.276
CA: And you've designed
this outrageous rocket to do it.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.716
Help us understand
the scale of this thing.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.620
EM: Well, visually
you can see that's a person.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.316
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.996
(Laughter)

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.756
CA: So if that was a skyscraper,

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.116
that's like, did I read that,
a 40-story skyscraper?

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.740
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.180
The thrust level of this is really --

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:55.100
This configuration is about four times
the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.116
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
rocket humanity ever created before.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.340
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.916
CA: As one does.
EM: Yeah.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.916
(Laughter)

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.916
In units of 747, a 747 is only about
a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.036
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.756
there's 40 747s.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:26.036
So this would be the thrust equivalent
of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.276
CA: And so even with a machine
designed to escape Earth's gravity,

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.716
I think you told me last time

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.996
this thing could actually
take a fully loaded 747,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.356
people, cargo, everything,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.636
into orbit.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.796
EM: Exactly. This can take
a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.316
maximum passengers,
maximum cargo on the 747 --

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.580
this can take it as cargo.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.636
CA: So based on this,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.476
you presented recently
this Interplanetary Transport System

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.876
which is visualized this way.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.980
This is a scene you picture in, what,
30 years time? 20 years time?

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.276
People walking into this rocket.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.876
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
an eight- to 10-year time frame.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.276
Aspirationally, that's our target.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.316
Our internal targets
are more aggressive, but I think --

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.499
(Laughter)

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.635
CA: OK.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.796
EM: While vehicle seems quite large

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.996
and is large by comparison
with other rockets,

00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:32.996
I think the future spacecraft

00:34:33.019 --> 00:34:36.860
will make this look like a rowboat.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.836
The future spaceships
will be truly enormous.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.036
CA: Why, Elon?

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:49.196
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.276
with a million people
on it in your lifetime,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.300
which I think is kind of
what you've said you'd love to do?

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.059
EM: I think it's important to have

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.676
a future that is inspiring and appealing.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.476
I just think there have to be reasons

00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:09.436
that you get up in the morning
and you want to live.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.916
Like, why do you want to live?

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.676
What's the point? What inspires you?

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.556
What do you love about the future?

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.076
And if we're not out there,

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.116
if the future does not include
being out there among the stars

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.836
and being a multiplanet species,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.356
I find that it's incredibly depressing

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.716
if that's not the future
that we're going to have.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.916
(Applause)

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.276
CA: People want to position this
as an either or,

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.996
that there are so many desperate things
happening on the planet now

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.460
from climate to poverty
to, you know, you pick your issue.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.836
And this feels like a distraction.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.676
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.876
You should be solving what's here and now.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.836
And to be fair, you've done
a fair old bit to actually do that

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.676
with your work on sustainable energy.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.740
But why not just do that?

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.260
EM: I think there's --

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.076
I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.276
It's like a branching
stream of probabilities,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:18.300
and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.940
or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.940
I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.836
Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.356
If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.236
it would have to happen out of necessity.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.836
It's tautological.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.516
If you don't have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.156
Eventually you will run out,

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.996
and the laws of economics
will drive civilization

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.676
towards sustainable energy,

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.916
inevitably.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.916
The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.356
is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.142
faster than it would otherwise occur.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.156
So when I think, like,

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.916
what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.636
I would say, hopefully,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.276
if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.436
that would be quite a good thing to occur.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.076
That's what I consider to be

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.180
the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:31.636
Then there's becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.596
This is not inevitable.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.316
It's very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.436
The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.196
but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.396
If you look at the progress in space,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.020
in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.060
1969.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.556
Then we had the Space Shuttle.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.996
The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.556
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.980
and the United States
could take no one to orbit.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.396
So that's the trend.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.100
The trend is like down to nothing.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.756
People are mistaken when they think

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.876
that technology
just automatically improves.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.796
It does not automatically improve.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.476
It only improves if a lot of people
work very hard to make it better,

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:28.276
and actually it will, I think,
by itself degrade, actually.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.716
You look at great civilizations
like Ancient Egypt,

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.676
and they were able to make the pyramids,

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.516
and they forgot how to do that.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.356
And then the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.580
They forgot how to do it.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.596
CA: Elon, it almost seems,
listening to you

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.876
and looking at the different
things you've done,

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.676
that you've got this unique
double motivation on everything

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.020
that I find so interesting.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.116
One is this desire to work
for humanity's long-term good.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.476
The other is the desire
to do something exciting.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.196
And often it feels like you feel
like you need the one to drive the other.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.316
With Tesla, you want
to have sustainable energy,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.876
so you made these super sexy,
exciting cars to do it.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.596
Solar energy, we need to get there,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.573
so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

00:39:14.597 --> 00:39:16.796
We haven't even spoken
about your newest thing,

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.356
which we don't have time to do,

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.716
but you want to save humanity from bad AI,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.036
and so you're going to create
this really cool brain-machine interface

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.916
to give us all infinite memory
and telepathy and so forth.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.636
And on Mars, it feels
like what you're saying is,

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.356
yeah, we need to save humanity

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.756
and have a backup plan,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.036
but also we need to inspire humanity,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.580
and this is a way to inspire.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.276
EM: I think the value
of beauty and inspiration

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.276
is very much underrated,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.876
no question.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.156
But I want to be clear.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.996
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.220
That is not the --

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.836
I'm just trying to think about the future

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.060
and not be sad.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.316
(Applause)

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.540
CA: Beautiful statement.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.596
I think everyone here would agree

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.820
that it is not --

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.676
None of this is going
to happen inevitably.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.356
The fact that in your mind,
you dream this stuff,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.956
you dream stuff that no one else
would dare dream,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.636
or no one else
would be capable of dreaming

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.316
at the level of complexity that you do.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.516
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,
is a really remarkable thing.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.236
Thank you for helping us all
to dream a bit bigger.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.756
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever
starts getting genuinely insane, right?

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.276
(Laughter)

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.396
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
That was really, really fantastic.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.836
That was really fantastic.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.940
(Applause)
