00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
TED Global -- for putting this conference together.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This conference is going to rank as the most important

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in the beginning of the 21st century.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Think African governments will put together a conference like this?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
June Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I call them the Cheetah Generation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
who brook no nonsense about corruption.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They understand what accountability and democracy is.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's the Cheetah Generation,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They are stuck in their intellectual patch.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they wouldn't move one foot.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If you ask them to reform the economies,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
they're not going to reform it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because they benefit from the rotten status quo.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
angry at the condition of Africa.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to lift its people out of poverty.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
there are so many people, so many governments,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They don't understand.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Helping Africa is noble.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's like the blind leading the clueless.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There are certain things that we need to recognize.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Africa's begging-bowl leaks.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is not invested here in Africa?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's taken out of Africa.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
That's what the World Bank says.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Look at Africa's begging-bowl.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It leaks horribly.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There are people who think that we should pour more money,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
more aid into this bowl which leaks.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What are the leakages?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Yes, put that aside.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Put that aside.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Let's take food imports.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Just add that up, all these leakages.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it also exported food.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Not anymore.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
this fundamental question,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Now, the previous speaker before me,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Idris Mohammed, indicated that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I belong to an Internet discussion forum,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
an African Internet discussion forum,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
204 African heads of state, since 1960."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
just 20 good leaders --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I asked them to name me just 20.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Laughter)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I let that pass.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Even if they had been able to name me 20,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
what does that tell you?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
of the African leaders failed their people.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
an assortment of military fufu heads,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
quack revolutionaries.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Applause)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that Africans have known for centuries.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The second false premise that we make

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
when we're trying to help Africa

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
is that sometimes we think that there is something called

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
a government in Africa that cares about its people,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
rats and the government."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Laughter)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
What you and I understand as a government

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
doesn't exist in many African countries.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Vampires because they suck

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the economic vitality out of their people.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Government is the problem in Africa.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
A vampire state is the government --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
(Applause)

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Where do they get their money?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
By creating wealth?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
No.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
is that if we want to help the African people,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
we must know where the African people are.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Take any African economy.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and the traditional sector.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's the seat of government.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It's dysfunctional.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
which the elites themselves don't understand.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
That is the source of many of Africa's problems

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
where the struggles for political power emanate

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
claiming innocent lives.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Now the modern sector, of course,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
went into the modern sector.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
are where you find the majority of the African people,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now, obviously it makes common sense

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But that's not what we did.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
As a matter of fact,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and that's why it must import food.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the informal and the traditional sectors.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
These two sectors, let me describe to you,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
have their own indigenous institutions.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
First one is the political system.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If you look into their traditional systems,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Africans organize their states in two types.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
so they didn't want to have anything to do

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
with any centralized authority.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
for example. They have no chiefs.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
made sure that they surrounded the chiefs

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
with councils upon councils upon councils

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to prevent them from abusing their power.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
In Ashanti tradition, for example,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the chief cannot make any decision

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
without the concurrence of the council of elders.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Without the council the chief can't pass any law,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
he will be removed.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
If not, the people will abandon the chief,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And even if you look in ancient African empires,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
they were all organized around one particular principle --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the confederacy principle,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
decentralization of power.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now, this is what I have described to you.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Now, compare that to the modern systems

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the ruling elites established on Africa.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It is a total far cry.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In the economic system in traditional Africa,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the means of production is privately owned.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It's owned by extended families.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
is the individual.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The American will say, "I am because I am,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The accent is on the "I."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The "we" connotes community -- the extended family system.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The extended family system pools its resources together.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
They don't take any orders from their chiefs.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They decide what to do.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
on marketplaces.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
not for the chief to sequester it from them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
was a free-market system.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
There were markets in Africa

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Timbuktu was one great big market town.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in West Africa has always been dominated by women.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
a marketplace.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
The market is not alien to Africa.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
but then after independence, all of a sudden,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
markets, capitalism became a western institution,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Nonsense.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Swiss-bank socialism,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which allowed the heads of states and the ministers

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to rape and plunder Africa's

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
treasuries for deposit in Switzerland.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
What do we do now?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
the traditional sectors.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That's where you find the African people.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And I'd like to show you a quick little video

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
about the informal sector, about the boat-building

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to invest in.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Could you please show that?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
The men are going fishing in these small boats.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Yes, it's an enterprise.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
He's getting no assistance from the government,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and he's building a second, bigger boat.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And then it will have what economists call

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
external effects on a local economy.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
is to move this operation into something that is enclosed

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
so that the operation can be made more efficient.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Now, it is not just this informal sector.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
There is also traditional medicine.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in the traditional medicine area.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
This is where we need to mobilize Africans,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
not only to go into the traditional sectors,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
one village at a time.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.000
(Applause)
