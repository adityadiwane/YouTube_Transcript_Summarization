00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm very fortunate to be here.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I feel so fortunate.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I called my wife Leslie,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and I said, "You know, there's so many good people

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
trying to do so much good.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It's a true feeling.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I'm a public school teacher,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Her name is Pam Moran

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in Albemarle County, Virginia,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
She uses smart boards, she blogs,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
she Tweets, she does Facebook,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
She's a technology leader and instructional leader.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But in her office,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Why is this old table in your office?"

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And she told me, she said,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and we'd sit around that table every night.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and so many insights and so much wisdom

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
come out around this table,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I began to call it the wisdom table.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and it reminds me of him.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The project I'm going to tell you about

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
is called the World Peace Game,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and essentially it is also an empty space.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And I'd like to think of it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
as a 21st century wisdom table, really.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It all started back in 1977.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I was a young man,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and I had been dropping in and out of college.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And my parents were very patient,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
on a mystical quest.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And I remember the last time I came back from India --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
in my long white flowing robes

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and I said to my father,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
(Laughter)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So I got a degree

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and it turned out to be education.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
It was an experimental education program.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and so that's what I had to go for.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And I went in for a job interview

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
kept my long beard and my afro

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And I guess they were hard up for teachers

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
said I had the job teaching gifted children.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And I was so shocked, so stunned,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
(Laughter)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
There weren't really many materials or things to use.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And I said, "What do I do?"

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Her answer set the template

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
for the entire career I was to have after that.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
She said, "What do you want to do?"

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And that question cleared the space.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
There was no program directive, no manual to follow,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
no standards in gifted education

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in that way.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And she cleared such a space

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that I endeavored from then on

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to clear a space for my students, an empty space,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
whereby they could create and make meaning

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
out of their own understanding.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So this happened in 1978,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and I was teaching many years later,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
His name is Chris Farina.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Applause)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
He proposed the film to me,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and we can say hi to our friends."

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But the film has really gone places.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to get this film out.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So we made a film

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and it turns out to be more than a story about me,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
more than a story about one teacher.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I saw myself literally disappear.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
What I saw

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
was my teachers coming through me.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
wry smile under his handlebar mustache.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And they weren't flashing in anger,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
You know the one.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
(Laughter)

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
because I've got eyes in the back of my head."

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
(Laughter)

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
You know that teacher?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
I didn't use that stare very often,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
but I do have it in my repertoire.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And then I saw

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
my own parents, my first teachers.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And my mother,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
who taught me in fourth grade

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in segregated schools in Virginia,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
who was my inspiration.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And really, I feel as though,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
when I see the film --

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
I have a gesture she does, like this --

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260
I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I am one of her teaching gestures.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And the beautiful thing was,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And so that gesture of my mother's

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
continues through many generations.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
It's an amazing feeling

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to have that lineage.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I'm not here alone.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
There are many people on this stage right now.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
It started out like this:

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
in an inner-city urban school, 1978.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
We put all the problems of the world there,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and I thought, let's let them solve it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
I wanted to have them be immersed

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So I thought, well they like to play games.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
we didn't have that term in 1978 --

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
but something interactive.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And so we made the game,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and it has since evolved

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Plexiglass structure.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And it has four Plexiglass layers.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
There's an outer space layer

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
with black holes and satellites

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and research satellites and asteroid mining.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
There's an air and space level

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and territorial air spaces and air forces,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
even an undersea level

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
with submarines and undersea mining.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
There are four countries around the board.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
They have different assets, commercial and military.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And each country has a cabinet.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and a CFO, or Comptroller.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
I offer them the job, they can turn it down,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and then they choose their own cabinet.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
There's also a weather goddess

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
who controls a random stock market and random weather.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
(Laughter)

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
That's not all.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And then there's a 13-page crisis document

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
with 50 interlocking problems.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I throw them into this complex matrix,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And so with all these crises,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions;

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
we have chemical and nuclear spills,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
nuclear proliferation.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
There's oil spills, environmental disasters,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
water rights disputes, breakaway republics,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
famine, endangered species and global warming.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
If Al Gore is here,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
because they solved global warming in a week.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
(Laughter)

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
(Applause)

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And they've done it several times too.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Laughter)

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So I also have in the game a saboteur --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
some child -- it's basically a troublemaker --

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
and I have my troublemaker put to use

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
because they, on the surface,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
are trying to save the world and their position in the game.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And they do it secretly through misinformation

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and ambiguities and irrelevancies,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
The saboteur is there,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and they handle that and use that

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
to understand how to, not follow --

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
at first they do --

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
the paths to power and destruction,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
the path to war.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and impulsive thinking,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
to think in a long-term, more consequential way.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
with a CoEvolution Quarterly article

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
on a peace force.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
I'm just a clock watcher.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
The students run the game.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
once they start playing.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
So I'll just share with you ...

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
because he says his time has messed up a lot,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and he's trying to tell us

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
how to fix that problem.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
John Hunter: I offered them a --

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
(Applause)

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And so I apologize to them as well.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
but the truth is

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and we hope you can fix it for us,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
It's a sincere apology,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and they take it very seriously.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:59.260
(Chatter)

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I've learned to cede control of the classroom

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
over to the students over time.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
There's a trust and an understanding

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and a dedication to an ideal

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that I simply don't have to do

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
control every conversation and response in the classroom.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
is much greater than mine,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and I admit it to them openly.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
of some magical things that have happened.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
In this game we had a little girl,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Without provocation,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
the next-door neighbor's oil fields.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
She marched into the oil field reserves,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
surrounded it, without firing a shot,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and secured it and held it.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
because their fuel supply was locked up.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
(Laughter)

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
This was a little girl and, at nine years old,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
To her girlfriends she said that.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
That's a breach there.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
a nine year-old girl with tanks.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
(Laughter)

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
They are the toughest opponents.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And we were very upset.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
But come to find out, a few game days later --

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team --

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
actually there's a negotiation period with all teams,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
and each team takes a turn,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
then we go back in negotiation, around and around,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
so each turn around is one game day.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
So a few game days later it came to light

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
that we found out this major country

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
was planning a military offensive

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
to dominate the entire world.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
long before any of us

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and understand what was going to happen

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
and made a philosophical decision

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
to attack in a peace game.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
about whether that was right,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
conditional good, or not right.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
I could not have designed that in teaching it.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:39.260
(Applause)

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Another example, a beautiful thing happened.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
We have a letter in the game.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
If you're a military commander and you wage troops --

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
I put in a letter.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
You have to write a letter to their parents --

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
the fictional parents of your fictional troops --

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
explaining what happened and offering your condolences.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
So you have a little bit more thought

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
before you commit to combat.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And so we had this situation come up --

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
last summer actually,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County --

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
let's ask -- there's a parent over there."

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
It'll be more realer if she reads it."

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
She read two sentences.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
By the third sentence, she was in tears.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I was in tears.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Everybody understood

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
We all lose.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
I'll show you what my friend David says about this.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
He's been in many battles.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.260
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
But now I'm feeling really weird

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
One week he said,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
"Those who go into battle and win

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
will want to go back,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and those who lose in battle

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
will want to go back and win."

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And so I've been winning battles,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
so I'm going into battles, more battles.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And I think it's sort of weird to be living

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
what Sun Tzu said.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
JH: I get chills every time I see that.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
And I can't design that, I can't plan that,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
and I can't even test that.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
But it's self-evident assessment.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
with the real truth of what's going on.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
So I'll just share a third story.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
This is about my friend Brennan.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
We had played the game one session after school

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
for many weeks, about seven weeks,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
and every country's asset value

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
has to be increased above its starting point.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
for high school players who were playing with him.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
So the team that was the poorest

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
had gotten even poorer.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
There was no way they could win.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
there was about a minute left --

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
and despair just settled over the room.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
I should have gotten it so they could have won.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
They shouldn't be failing like this.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
I've failed them.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
They get these dossiers full of secret documents.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
They were gesticulating; they were running around.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
The parents were looking in the window.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" --

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
and there's 12 seconds left on the clock --

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And we've got 600 billion dollars.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
Will you accept it?"

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
And there are three seconds left on the clock.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
and he says, "Yes."

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
And the game is won.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Spontaneous compassion

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
that could not be planned for,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
that was unexpected and unpredictable.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
Every game we play is different.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
Some games are more about social issues,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
some are more about economic issues.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
Some games are more about warfare.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
I allow them to go there

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.260
and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
And they find out what is right

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
their own way, their own selves.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
And so in this game,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
I've learned so much from it,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
but I would say

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
that if only

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
they could pick up a critical thinking tool

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
or creative thinking tool

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
from this game

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.260
and leverage something good for the world,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
they may save us all.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
If only.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
And on behalf of all of my teachers

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
on whose shoulders I'm standing,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:20:21.260
(Applause)
