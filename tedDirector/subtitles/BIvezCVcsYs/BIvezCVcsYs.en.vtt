00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.116
In the movie "Interstellar,"

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.467
we get an up-close look
at a supermassive black hole.

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:20.634
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:22.776
the black hole's massive
gravitational pull

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.235
bends light into a ring.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.368
However, this isn't a real photograph,

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.178
but a computer graphic rendering --

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:31.592
an artistic interpretation
of what a black hole might look like.

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.387
A hundred years ago,

00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.012
Albert Einstein first published
his theory of general relativity.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.475
In the years since then,

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.472
scientists have provided
a lot of evidence in support of it.

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.580
But one thing predicted
from this theory, black holes,

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.954
still have not been directly observed.

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:50.184
Although we have some idea
as to what a black hole might look like,

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.987
we've never actually taken
a picture of one before.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.290
However, you might be surprised to know
that that may soon change.

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:01.478
We may be seeing our first picture
of a black hole in the next couple years.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:05.460
Getting this first picture will come down
to an international team of scientists,

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.051
an Earth-sized telescope

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.907
and an algorithm that puts together
the final picture.

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.459
Although I won't be able to show you
a real picture of a black hole today,

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:16.394
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse
into the effort involved

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:18.031
in getting that first picture.

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:20.734
My name is Katie Bouman,

00:01:20.758 --> 00:01:23.324
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:25.375
I do research in a computer science lab

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.697
that works on making computers
see through images and video.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.883
But although I'm not an astronomer,

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.192
today I'd like to show you

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.119
how I've been able to contribute
to this exciting project.

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:37.974
If you go out past
the bright city lights tonight,

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.434
you may just be lucky enough
to see a stunning view

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.951
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.437
And if you could zoom past
millions of stars,

00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:48.216
26,000 light-years toward the heart
of the spiraling Milky Way,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.761
we'd eventually reach
a cluster of stars right at the center.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.991
Peering past all the galactic dust
with infrared telescopes,

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.882
astronomers have watched these stars
for over 16 years.

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.495
But it's what they don't see
that is the most spectacular.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.585
These stars seem to orbit
an invisible object.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.932
By tracking the paths of these stars,

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.250
astronomers have concluded

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:12.403
that the only thing small and heavy
enough to cause this motion

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.395
is a supermassive black hole --

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.597
an object so dense that it sucks up
anything that ventures too close --

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.115
even light.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.200
But what happens if we were
to zoom in even further?

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:27.957
Is it possible to see something
that, by definition, is impossible to see?

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.783
Well, it turns out that if we were
to zoom in at radio wavelengths,

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.489
we'd expect to see a ring of light

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:35.924
caused by the gravitational
lensing of hot plasma

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:37.777
zipping around the black hole.

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.961
In other words,

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:42.156
the black hole casts a shadow
on this backdrop of bright material,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.022
carving out a sphere of darkness.

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:47.385
This bright ring reveals
the black hole's event horizon,

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.809
where the gravitational pull
becomes so great

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.459
that not even light can escape.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:54.342
Einstein's equations predict
the size and shape of this ring,

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:57.574
so taking a picture of it
wouldn't only be really cool,

00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:00.216
it would also help to verify
that these equations hold

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.706
in the extreme conditions
around the black hole.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.288
However, this black hole
is so far away from us,

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:08.410
that from Earth, this ring appears
incredibly small --

00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:12.024
the same size to us as an orange
on the surface of the moon.

00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:15.402
That makes taking a picture of it
extremely difficult.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.767
Why is that?

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:21.520
Well, it all comes down
to a simple equation.

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.960
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:25.339
there are fundamental limits

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:28.033
to the smallest objects
that we can possibly see.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.281
This governing equation says
that in order to see smaller and smaller,

00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:34.892
we need to make our telescope
bigger and bigger.

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:37.985
But even with the most powerful
optical telescopes here on Earth,

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.428
we can't even get close
to the resolution necessary

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.650
to image on the surface of the moon.

00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:46.291
In fact, here I show one of the highest
resolution images ever taken

00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:47.712
of the moon from Earth.

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:50.293
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:54.367
and yet each pixel would contain
over 1.5 million oranges.

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:57.188
So how big of a telescope do we need

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:59.977
in order to see an orange
on the surface of the moon

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.215
and, by extension, our black hole?

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.579
Well, it turns out
that by crunching the numbers,

00:04:04.603 --> 00:04:07.213
you can easily calculate
that we would need a telescope

00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:08.630
the size of the entire Earth.

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:09.678
(Laughter)

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:11.821
If we could build
this Earth-sized telescope,

00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:14.770
we could just start to make out
that distinctive ring of light

00:04:14.794 --> 00:04:16.977
indicative of the black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.919
Although this picture wouldn't contain
all the detail we see

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:21.449
in computer graphic renderings,

00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:23.772
it would allow us to safely get
our first glimpse

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.283
of the immediate environment
around a black hole.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.920
However, as you can imagine,

00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:31.568
building a single-dish telescope
the size of the Earth is impossible.

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:33.479
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:35.294
"You can't always get what you want,

00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.505
but if you try sometimes,
you just might find

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.744
you get what you need."

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:41.232
And by connecting telescopes
from around the world,

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:44.794
an international collaboration
called the Event Horizon Telescope

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:47.927
is creating a computational telescope
the size of the Earth,

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.488
capable of resolving structure

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:51.711
on the scale of a black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:55.122
This network of telescopes is scheduled
to take its very first picture

00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.961
of a black hole next year.

00:04:56.985 --> 00:05:00.323
Each telescope in the worldwide
network works together.

00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:03.059
Linked through the precise timing
of atomic clocks,

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:05.740
teams of researchers at each
of the sights freeze light

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.726
by collecting thousands
of terabytes of data.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.767
This data is then processed in a lab
right here in Massachusetts.

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.585
So how does this even work?

00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:19.012
Remember if we want to see the black hole
in the center of our galaxy,

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:22.018
we need to build this impossibly large
Earth-sized telescope?

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.274
For just a second,
let's pretend we could build

00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:26.140
a telescope the size of the Earth.

00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:28.619
This would be a little bit
like turning the Earth

00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:30.390
into a giant spinning disco ball.

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.614
Each individual mirror would collect light

00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:35.235
that we could then combine
together to make a picture.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.920
However, now let's say
we remove most of those mirrors

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:39.916
so only a few remained.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.817
We could still try to combine
this information together,

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.834
but now there are a lot of holes.

00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:49.231
These remaining mirrors represent
the locations where we have telescopes.

00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:53.334
This is an incredibly small number
of measurements to make a picture from.

00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:57.196
But although we only collect light
at a few telescope locations,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.643
as the Earth rotates, we get to see
other new measurements.

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:04.486
In other words, as the disco ball spins,
those mirrors change locations

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.409
and we get to observe
different parts of the image.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:11.451
The imaging algorithms we develop
fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:14.508
in order to reconstruct
the underlying black hole image.

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:17.168
If we had telescopes located
everywhere on the globe --

00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:19.133
in other words, the entire disco ball --

00:06:19.157 --> 00:06:20.441
this would be trivial.

00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:23.787
However, we only see a few samples,
and for that reason,

00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.199
there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:29.187
that are perfectly consistent
with our telescope measurements.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.227
However, not all images are created equal.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.127
Some of those images look more like
what we think of as images than others.

00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.373
And so, my role in helping to take
the first image of a black hole

00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:43.329
is to design algorithms that find
the most reasonable image

00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:45.575
that also fits the telescope measurements.

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:50.489
Just as a forensic sketch artist
uses limited descriptions

00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:54.027
to piece together a picture using
their knowledge of face structure,

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.366
the imaging algorithms I develop
use our limited telescope data

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.712
to guide us to a picture that also
looks like stuff in our universe.

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:05.387
Using these algorithms,
we're able to piece together pictures

00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:07.591
from this sparse, noisy data.

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:12.144
So here I show a sample reconstruction
done using simulated data,

00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:14.101
when we pretend to point our telescopes

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.710
to the black hole
in the center of our galaxy.

00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:21.189
Although this is just a simulation,
reconstruction such as this give us hope

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:24.666
that we'll soon be able to reliably take
the first image of a black hole

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.285
and from it, determine
the size of its ring.

00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:31.137
Although I'd love to go on
about all the details of this algorithm,

00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.335
luckily for you, I don't have the time.

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:35.360
But I'd still like
to give you a brief idea

00:07:35.384 --> 00:07:37.686
of how we define
what our universe looks like,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.176
and how we use this to reconstruct
and verify our results.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.696
Since there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.085
that perfectly explain
our telescope measurements,

00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:49.714
we have to choose
between them in some way.

00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:51.576
We do this by ranking the images

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.434
based upon how likely they are
to be the black hole image,

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.940
and then choosing the one
that's most likely.

00:07:56.964 --> 00:07:59.159
So what do I mean by this exactly?

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:01.660
Let's say we were trying to make a model

00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:04.867
that told us how likely an image
were to appear on Facebook.

00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:06.592
We'd probably want the model to say

00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:10.173
it's pretty unlikely that someone
would post this noise image on the left,

00:08:10.197 --> 00:08:12.616
and pretty likely that someone
would post a selfie

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.974
like this one on the right.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:15.637
The image in the middle is blurry,

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.300
so even though it's more likely
we'd see it on Facebook

00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:19.684
compared to the noise image,

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.668
it's probably less likely we'd see it
compared to the selfie.

00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:24.982
But when it comes to images
from the black hole,

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:28.508
we're posed with a real conundrum:
we've never seen a black hole before.

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.823
In that case, what is a likely
black hole image,

00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:33.785
and what should we assume
about the structure of black holes?

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.441
We could try to use images
from simulations we've done,

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.995
like the image of the black hole
from "Interstellar,"

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.957
but if we did this,
it could cause some serious problems.

00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:45.361
What would happen
if Einstein's theories didn't hold?

00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:49.346
We'd still want to reconstruct
an accurate picture of what was going on.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.741
If we bake Einstein's equations
too much into our algorithms,

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.520
we'll just end up seeing
what we expect to see.

00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:57.820
In other words,
we want to leave the option open

00:08:57.844 --> 00:09:00.767
for there being a giant elephant
at the center of our galaxy.

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:01.848
(Laughter)

00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:04.861
Different types of images have
very distinct features.

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:08.433
We can easily tell the difference
between black hole simulation images

00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:10.733
and images we take
every day here on Earth.

00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:13.861
We need a way to tell our algorithms
what images look like

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:17.134
without imposing one type
of image's features too much.

00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:19.578
One way we can try to get around this

00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:22.664
is by imposing the features
of different kinds of images

00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:26.818
and seeing how the type of image we assume
affects our reconstructions.

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:31.023
If all images' types produce
a very similar-looking image,

00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:33.104
then we can start to become more confident

00:09:33.128 --> 00:09:37.301
that the image assumptions we're making
are not biasing this picture that much.

00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:40.315
This is a little bit like
giving the same description

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:43.335
to three different sketch artists
from all around the world.

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:46.219
If they all produce
a very similar-looking face,

00:09:46.243 --> 00:09:48.036
then we can start to become confident

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.676
that they're not imposing their own
cultural biases on the drawings.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.015
One way we can try to impose
different image features

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:57.480
is by using pieces of existing images.

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.194
So we take a large collection of images,

00:10:00.218 --> 00:10:02.936
and we break them down
into their little image patches.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.245
We then can treat each image patch
a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:11.547
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces
to piece together an image

00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:14.023
that also fits our telescope measurements.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.603
Different types of images have
very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.

00:10:18.627 --> 00:10:21.433
So what happens when we take the same data

00:10:21.457 --> 00:10:25.587
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces
to reconstruct the image?

00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:30.377
Let's first start with black hole
image simulation puzzle pieces.

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:31.992
OK, this looks reasonable.

00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:34.710
This looks like what we expect
a black hole to look like.

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:35.927
But did we just get it

00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:39.265
because we just fed it little pieces
of black hole simulation images?

00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:41.169
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces

00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:43.702
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.

00:10:44.734 --> 00:10:46.860
OK, we get a similar-looking image.

00:10:46.884 --> 00:10:49.120
And then how about pieces
from everyday images,

00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:51.929
like the images you take
with your own personal camera?

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.247
Great, we see the same image.

00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:58.637
When we get the same image
from all different sets of puzzle pieces,

00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.707
then we can start to become more confident

00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:02.697
that the image assumptions we're making

00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:05.642
aren't biasing the final
image we get too much.

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.919
Another thing we can do is take
the same set of puzzle pieces,

00:11:08.943 --> 00:11:11.432
such as the ones derived
from everyday images,

00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:15.056
and use them to reconstruct
many different kinds of source images.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.351
So in our simulations,

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.150
we pretend a black hole looks like
astronomical non-black hole objects,

00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:24.023
as well as everyday images like
the elephant in the center of our galaxy.

00:11:24.047 --> 00:11:27.215
When the results of our algorithms
on the bottom look very similar

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:29.335
to the simulation's truth image on top,

00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:32.705
then we can start to become
more confident in our algorithms.

00:11:32.729 --> 00:11:34.596
And I really want to emphasize here

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.554
that all of these pictures were created

00:11:36.578 --> 00:11:39.514
by piecing together little pieces
of everyday photographs,

00:11:39.538 --> 00:11:41.753
like you'd take with your own
personal camera.

00:11:41.777 --> 00:11:45.053
So an image of a black hole
we've never seen before

00:11:45.077 --> 00:11:49.020
may eventually be created by piecing
together pictures we see all the time

00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:51.789
of people, buildings,
trees, cats and dogs.

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:54.458
Imaging ideas like this
will make it possible for us

00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:57.101
to take our very first pictures
of a black hole,

00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.572
and hopefully, verify
those famous theories

00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:02.017
on which scientists rely on a daily basis.

00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:04.649
But of course, getting
imaging ideas like this working

00:12:04.673 --> 00:12:07.995
would never have been possible
without the amazing team of researchers

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.906
that I have the privilege to work with.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.093
It still amazes me

00:12:11.117 --> 00:12:14.468
that although I began this project
with no background in astrophysics,

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:17.111
what we have achieved
through this unique collaboration

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:19.894
could result in the very first
images of a black hole.

00:12:19.918 --> 00:12:22.616
But big projects like
the Event Horizon Telescope

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.454
are successful due to all
the interdisciplinary expertise

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.268
different people bring to the table.

00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:28.998
We're a melting pot of astronomers,

00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:31.254
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.

00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:33.832
This is what will make it soon possible

00:12:33.856 --> 00:12:36.709
to achieve something
once thought impossible.

00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:38.989
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:41.109
and help push the boundaries of science,

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:45.034
even if it may at first seem
as mysterious to you as a black hole.

00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:46.232
Thank you.

00:12:46.256 --> 00:12:48.653
(Applause)
