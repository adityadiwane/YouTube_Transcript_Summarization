00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.236
For the last five years,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.420
I have documented the lives
of teenage mothers in Latin America.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.316
I started with a series of photographs

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.036
about the moment of birth

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.660
in my country, Uruguay.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.340
(Video) (Screaming)

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.860
(Grunting)

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.140
(Newborn crying)

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.076
I am the son of a teenage mother

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.340
and my sister became
a teenage mother when she was 16.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.156
I began exploring the theme

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
to better understand
myself and my origins.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.420
In developing countries,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.396
7.3 million girls under the age of 18

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.570
give birth each year.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.476
Projections suggest

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.196
that the teen pregnancy rate
in Latin America

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.236
will be the highest in the world

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.780
for the next 80 years.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.476
In Mexico, almost one in two
sexually active adolescents

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.580
get pregnant between the ages
of 12 to 19 years old.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780
Teenage pregnancy
is not just about young pregnancies.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.436
It is about gender violence,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.180
physical, symbolic, psychological
and economic violence.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.836
Girls who become pregnant
before they are 18

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.460
rarely achieve an adequate
standard of living.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.516
The pattern of poverty

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.396
and limited access
to education and health care

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.900
are a common thread
among teen pregnancies.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.196
If a girl in Latin America
gets pregnant before she is 16,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.676
the risk of maternal death
increases fourfold

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.540
over a woman in their 20s.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.940
And somehow, in spite of all this,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.716
motherhood also imparts a status

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.580
and a respect to the adolescent
in her community.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.380
Her child becomes her life project.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.436
A high percentage of girls
under the age of 18 are single mothers,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.700
as was my mother.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.596
When I was learning to be a parent,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.996
I began to focus on the relationship
between father and child,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.740
a subject rarely given much attention.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.876
I wanted to highlight the ways

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.556
in which we need
to educate boys differently

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.660
without turning them into macho men.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.900
In some cases, families
send boys to school but not girls.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.476
The persistence of teen pregnancy
heightened the gender equity gap

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700
and the continued existence
of traditional roles.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.116
If we were to allow
equal opportunities to girls,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.780
they could gain independence.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.796
Educating girls is key

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.660
to breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.636
Girls getting pregnant
between the ages of 10 to 14

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.436
are an extremely vulnerable population,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.060
and they can be easy prey
for men twice their age.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.116
There are many cases of violence,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.196
incest and sexual abuse

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.100
perpetrated against this group.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.836
This is Gloria.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.356
She became a teen mother at the age of 12,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.196
a result of the ongoing
abuse by her father,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.180
who was also raping Gloria's two sisters,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.700
ages 8 and 16.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.500
In this portrait,
she has butterflies in her hair,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.340
symbols of resurrection.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.260
For me, it's extremely important
to portray this mother with dignity.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.116
Pregnancies among girls
younger than 15 is a growing trend,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.676
not only in Latin America,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.740
but many developing
countries in the world.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.796
Our region is marred
by bad social and cultural inequalities,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.060
and teen pregnancy
further increases this divide.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.196
I am committing
to being part of the solution

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.076
by making work that implicitly
and emphatically

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.980
calls for human rights for girls.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.875
The day life projects
for boys and girls become similar,

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:33.796
teenage pregnancy will decrease.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.036
Thank you.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.220
(Applause)
