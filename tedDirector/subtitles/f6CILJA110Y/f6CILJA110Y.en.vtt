00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.030
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.839
I've spent hundreds of days

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.326
in psychiatric hospitals.

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.131
I might have ended up spending

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.958
most of my life on the back ward of a hospital,

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.158
but that isn't how my life turned out.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:30.606
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:32.095
for almost three decades,

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.038
perhaps my proudest accomplishment.

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.232
That's not to say that I've remained clear

00:00:36.232 --> 00:00:37.839
of all psychiatric struggles.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.264
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and

00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:43.270
got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.855
announced to me that he was going to close his practice

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.735
in three months, several years

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:49.432
before I had planned to leave New Haven.

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:52.201
White had been enormously helpful to me,

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.258
and the thought of his leaving

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:55.144
shattered me.

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:56.614
My best friend Steve,

00:00:56.614 --> 00:00:58.366
sensing that something was terribly wrong,

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.198
flew out to New Haven to be with me.

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:02.286
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings:

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:04.801
"I opened the door to my studio apartment.

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.974
Steve would later tell me that,

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.710
for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.711
could have prepared him for what he saw that day.

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:14.384
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:16.944
I was gaunt. I walked

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.558
as though my legs were wooden.

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.585
My face looked and felt like a mask.

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:24.429
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.384
in the middle of the day

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.398
the apartment was in near total darkness.

00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:30.150
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.466
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.599
many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.287
he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:42.366
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.490
where I sat in silence for several moments.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.335
'Thank you for coming, Steve.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:50.386
Crumbling world, word, voice.

00:01:50.386 --> 00:01:52.255
Tell the clocks to stop.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:54.046
Time is. Time has come.'

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:57.287
'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.

00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:00.718
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:02.345
'Gravity is pulling me down.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.478
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:08.190
As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.694
on three different occasions for lengthy periods.

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:13.486
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:16.081
and gave me a prognosis of "grave."

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.511
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,

00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:21.215
and work at menial jobs.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.215
Fortunately, I did not actually

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:24.990
enact that grave prognosis.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.831
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.456
and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:32.086
I have many close friends

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:35.271
and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:39.798
(Applause) Thank you.

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:45.072
He's definitely the star of my show.

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:47.870
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.639
describe my experience of being psychotic.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.119
I hasten to add that it's my experience,

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:55.775
because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.836
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.

00:02:58.836 --> 00:03:01.057
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.482
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.074
out of touch with reality.

00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:06.896
Delusions and hallucinations

00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:08.450
are hallmarks of the illness.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.202
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:15.018
to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.

00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:17.368
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have

00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:19.619
the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.196
of people with my thoughts.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:22.901
I sometimes have the idea that

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.396
nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:27.732
Occasionally, I have hallucinations,

00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:29.500
like one time I turned around and saw a man

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.077
with a raised knife.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.869
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.079
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.625
to the point of incoherence.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.504
Loose associations involves putting together words

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.287
that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:46.677
and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:51.115
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not

00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:54.530
the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.081
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.660
Everyone has seen a street person,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.683
unkempt, probably ill-fed,

00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:05.260
standing outside of an office building muttering

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.073
to himself or shouting.

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:09.670
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.001
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.825
of socioeconomic status, and there are people

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.355
with the illness who are full-time professionals

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:19.707
with major responsibilities.

00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:20.918
Several years ago, I decided

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:24.353
to write down my experiences and my personal journey,

00:04:24.353 --> 00:04:26.651
and I want to share some more of that story with you today

00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:28.314
to convey the inside view.

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:31.099
So the following episode happened the seventh week

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.962
of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:36.167
Quoting from my writings:

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:39.636
"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date

00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:42.597
to meet in the law school library on Friday night

00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:44.881
to work on our memo assignment together.

00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:46.683
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.206
that made no sense.

00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:51.270
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.790
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.245
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:58.261
Rebel and Val looked at me

00:04:58.261 --> 00:04:59.932
as if they or I had been

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.512
splashed in the face with cold water.

00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:03.068
'What are you talking about, Elyn?'

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.077
'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:08.332
heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.

00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:09.908
It's a flat surface. It's safe.'

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.492
Rebel and Val followed

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:12.941
and they asked what had gotten into me.

00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.804
'This is the real me,' I announced,

00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:16.349
waving my arms above my head.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.124
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof

00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:20.281
of the Yale Law School,

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.573
I began to sing, and not quietly either.

00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:25.677
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.

00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:26.988
Do you want to dance?'

00:05:26.988 --> 00:05:29.463
'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.919
'High? Me? No way, no drugs.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.486
Come to the Florida sunshine bush,

00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:37.759
where there are lemons, where they make demons.'

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.453
'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val

00:05:40.453 --> 00:05:42.232
headed back into the library.

00:05:42.232 --> 00:05:44.349
I shrugged and followed them.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.716
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:49.933
having the same experience of words jumping around

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.277
our cases as I was.

00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:55.300
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.804
'We've got to case the joint.

00:05:56.804 --> 00:05:58.387
I don't believe in joints, but

00:05:58.387 --> 00:05:59.852
they do hold your body together.'" --

00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:02.221
It's an example of loose associations. --

00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:04.605
"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:06.964
and once there, I couldn't settle down.

00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:08.789
My head was too full of noise,

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.476
too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:15.108
and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.453
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,

00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:20.485
moaning in fear and isolation."

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:23.612
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:25.852
I had two earlier in England.

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.413
Continuing with the writings:

00:06:27.413 --> 00:06:29.877
"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask

00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:31.454
for an extension on the memo assignment,

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.611
and I began gibbering unintelligably

00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:34.957
as I had the night before,

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:36.630
and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.431
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'

00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.398
and his whole team of goons swooped down,

00:06:42.398 --> 00:06:43.807
lifted me high into the air,

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:45.480
and slammed me down on a metal bed

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.832
with such force that I saw stars.

00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:50.390
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.057
with thick leather straps.

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:55.403
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:

00:06:55.403 --> 00:06:57.431
half groan, half scream,

00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:00.775
barely human and pure terror.

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:02.446
Then the sound came again,

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:04.370
forced from somewhere deep inside my belly

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.967
and scraping my throat raw."

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:10.246
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:13.787
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me

00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:15.072
against my will was that I was

00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:16.479
"gravely disabled."

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.575
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable

00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:21.367
to do my Yale Law School homework.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.408
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.

00:07:24.408 --> 00:07:26.014
(Laughter)

00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:28.703
During the next year, I would

00:07:28.703 --> 00:07:30.855
spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:34.334
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,

00:07:34.334 --> 00:07:37.824
arms tied, arms and legs tied down,

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.343
arms and legs tied down with a net tied

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:42.151
tightly across my chest.

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:44.198
I never struck anyone.

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.104
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:49.878
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have

00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.575
a benign image of the experience.

00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:54.550
There's nothing benign about it.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.335
Every week in the United States,

00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:59.255
it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.

00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:01.871
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,

00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:04.024
they suffocate, they have a heart attack.

00:08:04.024 --> 00:08:06.550
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.070
is actually saving lives or costing lives.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.864
While I was preparing to write my student note

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:14.064
for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,

00:08:14.064 --> 00:08:16.416
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.501
a psychiatrist,

00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:19.214
and said surely he would agree

00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:21.510
that restraints must be degrading,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.046
painful and frightening.

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:25.157
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:27.486
"Elyn, you don't really understand:

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:29.224
These people are psychotic.

00:08:29.224 --> 00:08:30.745
They're different from me and you.

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:33.509
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:36.343
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,

00:08:36.343 --> 00:08:38.344
no, we're not that different from him.

00:08:38.344 --> 00:08:40.702
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed

00:08:40.702 --> 00:08:43.032
and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.

00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:45.184
In fact, until very recently,

00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:47.166
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:50.198
that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.

00:08:50.198 --> 00:08:52.630
I've never met a psychiatric patient

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.024
who agreed with that view.

00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:56.735
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.238
but very anti-force.

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:01.229
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.966
using force is a terrible thing to do to another person

00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:05.325
with a terrible illness.

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:08.046
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.544
to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.

00:09:10.544 --> 00:09:12.864
For years, I had resisted medication,

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:14.854
making many, many efforts to get off.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.529
I felt that if I could manage without medication,

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:19.567
I could prove that, after all,

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:22.317
I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.

00:09:22.317 --> 00:09:25.624
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.

00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:28.712
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me

00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:31.212
just to stay on medication and get on with my life,

00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:34.687
but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.

00:09:34.687 --> 00:09:36.119
Quoting from the text:

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:39.759
"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.871
I began feeling the effects.

00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:44.712
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:48.089
Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:50.322
covered my face, and began shaking.

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:53.477
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.

00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:55.645
They'd slice me up in thin slices

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:57.287
or make me swallow hot coals.

00:09:57.287 --> 00:10:00.664
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'

00:10:00.664 --> 00:10:03.749
Even in this state, what he accurately described as

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:05.440
acutely and forwardly psychotic,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.453
I refused to take more medication.

00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:10.253
The mission is not yet complete.

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:12.871
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:15.169
I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert

00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:17.477
who was following me for medication side effects.

00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:20.498
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.

00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:23.926
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:25.565
and began muttering.

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:27.795
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.

00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:30.260
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?'

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.892
'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'

00:10:32.892 --> 00:10:33.875
said Marder.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:37.027
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.

00:10:37.027 --> 00:10:38.675
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:41.252
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'

00:10:41.252 --> 00:10:42.987
'Elyn, do you feel like you're

00:10:42.987 --> 00:10:44.484
dangerous to yourself or others?

00:10:44.484 --> 00:10:46.899
I think you need to be in the hospital.

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:48.756
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing

00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:49.891
could be very discrete.'

00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:51.572
'Ha, ha, ha.

00:10:51.572 --> 00:10:53.909
You're offering to put me in hospitals?

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:56.852
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.

00:10:56.852 --> 00:11:00.516
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.099
At that point in the text,

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.004
where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband

00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:05.029
made a marginal note.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:06.636
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.867
(Laughter)

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:12.619
"'I give life and I take it away.

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:14.316
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.'

00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:17.630
Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.138
everybody convinced me to take more medication.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.084
I could no longer deny the truth,

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:23.606
and I could not change it.

00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:26.255
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,

00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:29.368
separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,

00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:31.479
lay smashed and in ruins."

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.152
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.026
but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:39.418
First, I've had excellent treatment.

00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:42.364
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy

00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:45.348
for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.

00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:49.392
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me

00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:50.646
and know my illness.

00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:52.970
These relationships have given my life a meaning

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.137
and a depth, and they also helped me navigate

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:57.105
my life in the face of symptoms.

00:11:57.105 --> 00:12:00.273
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:01.858
at USC Law School.

00:12:01.858 --> 00:12:04.883
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:06.274
but actually embraces them.

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:09.305
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place,

00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:11.897
and occupying my mind with complex problems

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:15.330
has been my best and most powerful and most reliable

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.050
defense against my mental illness.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.353
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and

00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:22.269
friends, supportive work environment —

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:24.602
I did not make my illness public

00:12:24.602 --> 00:12:26.035
until relatively late in life,

00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:28.554
and that's because the stigma against mental illness

00:12:28.554 --> 00:12:31.162
is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:33.578
If you hear nothing else today,

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:37.012
please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."

00:12:37.012 --> 00:12:40.163
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people

00:12:40.163 --> 00:12:42.258
may be your spouse, they may be your child,

00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:44.682
they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,

00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:46.106
they may be your coworker.

00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:48.962
So let me share some final thoughts.

00:12:48.962 --> 00:12:52.394
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment

00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:53.634
of mental illness.

00:12:53.634 --> 00:12:55.690
The better we understand these illnesses, the better

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.898
the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments

00:12:57.898 --> 00:13:00.338
we can provide, the more we can offer people care,

00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:01.786
and not have to use force.

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:04.738
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.

00:13:04.738 --> 00:13:08.786
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail

00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:11.428
is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.

00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:15.344
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:17.828
from severe mental illness, and many of them are there

00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:19.805
because they never received adequate treatment.

00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:23.234
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.

00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:26.458
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:30.522
On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma

00:13:30.522 --> 00:13:32.338
and prejudice of many kinds.

00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:35.338
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,

00:13:35.338 --> 00:13:37.466
your plays, your columns,

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:39.290
who suffer with severe mental illness.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.050
Portray them sympathetically,

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.689
and portray them in all the richness and depth

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:47.216
of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.

00:13:47.216 --> 00:13:49.492
Recently, a friend posed a question:

00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:51.267
If there were a pill I could take

00:13:51.267 --> 00:13:53.078
that would instantly cure me, would I take it?

00:13:53.078 --> 00:13:55.771
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke

00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.243
was offered psychoanalysis.

00:13:57.243 --> 00:13:59.555
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,

00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:01.314
because my angels may flee too."

00:14:01.314 --> 00:14:03.507
My psychosis, on the other hand,

00:14:03.507 --> 00:14:06.179
is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.115
that all my angels have already fled.

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:12.019
So would I take the pill? In an instant.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.700
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.093
the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,

00:14:17.093 --> 00:14:19.375
nor am I asking anyone for their pity.

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:22.506
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share

00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:25.139
is more important than the mental illness we may not.

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:27.597
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want

00:14:27.597 --> 00:14:29.051
is what everybody wants:

00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:31.585
in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:34.608
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:35.285
(Applause)

00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:40.078
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:46.685
Thank you. (Applause)
