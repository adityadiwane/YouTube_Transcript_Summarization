00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.626
When I was seven years old,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.761
some well-meaning adult asked me
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.803
Proudly, I said: "An artist."

00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:22.188
"No, you don't," he said,

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:24.494
"You can't make a living being an artist!"

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.990
My little seven-year-old
Picasso dreams were crushed.

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:29.686
But I gathered myself,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.569
went off in search of a new dream,

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:34.451
eventually settling on being a scientist,

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:37.119
perhaps something like
the next Albert Einstein.

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:39.724
(Laughter)

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:42.087
I have always loved math and science,

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.622
later, coding.

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:46.665
And so I decided to study
computer programming in college.

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:48.463
In my junior year,

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:52.278
my computer graphics professor
showed us these wonderful short films.

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:56.128
It was the first computer animation
any of us had ever seen.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.346
I watched these films
in wonder, transfixed,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.581
fireworks going off in my head,

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.403
thinking, "That is what
I want to do with my life."

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.539
The idea that all the math, science
and code I had been learning

00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:11.701
could come together to create
these worlds and characters

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:13.587
and stories I connected with,

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.142
was pure magic for me.

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:18.015
Just two years later, I started working

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.058
at the place that made those films,
Pixar Animation Studios.

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:23.812
It was here I learned how
we actually execute those films.

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:25.462
To create our movies,

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:28.255
we create a three-dimensional
world inside the computer.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.525
We start with a point that makes
a line that makes a face

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.257
that creates characters,

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.953
or trees and rocks
that eventually become a forest.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.438
And because it's
a three-dimensional world,

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:41.858
we can move a camera
around inside that world.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.417
I was fascinated by all of it.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.722
But then I got my first taste of lighting.

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:52.230
Lighting in practice is placing lights
inside this three-dimensional world.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:54.974
I actually have icons of lights
I move around in there.

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:56.720
Here you can see I've added a light,

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:59.608
I'm turning on the rough version
of lighting in our software,

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.863
turn on shadows

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.291
and placing the light.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:03.482
As I place a light,

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.218
I think about what it might
look like in real life,

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:10.168
but balance that out with what we need
artistically and for the story.

00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.131
So it might look like this at first,

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:16.569
but as we adjust this and move that

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.138
in weeks of work,

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:20.377
in rough form it might look like this,

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:23.401
and in final form, like this.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.357
There's this moment in lighting
that made me fall utterly in love with it.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.131
It's where we go from this

00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:36.021
to this.

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:38.581
It's the moment where
all the pieces come together,

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.208
and suddenly the world comes to life

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:43.620
as if it's an actual place that exists.

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.716
This moment never gets old,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.608
especially for that little seven-year-old
girl that wanted to be an artist.

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:50.785
As I learned to light,

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.340
I learned about using light
to help tell story,

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:56.173
to set the time of day,

00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:58.810
to create the mood,

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:01.879
to guide the audience's eye,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.009
how to make a character look appealing

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.990
or stand out in a busy set.

00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:09.534
Did you see WALL-E?

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:10.597
(Laughter)

00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:11.834
There he is.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.713
As you can see,

00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:17.444
we can create any world that we want
inside the computer.

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.166
We can make a world with monsters,

00:03:20.837 --> 00:03:22.666
with robots that fall in love,

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.335
we can even make pigs fly.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.772
(Laughter)

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:32.138
While this is an incredible thing,

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:34.637
this untethered artistic freedom,

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.643
it can create chaos.

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.518
It can create unbelievable worlds,

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.026
unbelievable movement,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.200
things that are jarring to the audience.

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.985
So to combat this, we tether
ourselves with science.

00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:48.406
We use science and the world we know

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.780
as a backbone,

00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:53.278
to ground ourselves in something
relatable and recognizable.

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:56.335
"Finding Nemo" is an excellent
example of this.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.004
A major portion of the movie
takes place underwater.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.278
But how do you make it look underwater?

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:02.933
In early research and development,

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:06.855
we took a clip of underwater footage
and recreated it in the computer.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.140
Then we broke it back down

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.938
to see which elements make up
that underwater look.

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:13.133
One of the most critical elements

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:15.339
was how the light travels
through the water.

00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:18.159
So we coded up a light
that mimics this physics --

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.927
first, the visibility of the water,

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:22.060
and then what happens with the color.

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:26.045
Objects close to the eye
have their full, rich colors.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.272
As light travels deeper into the water,

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:30.206
we lose the red wavelengths,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.574
then the green wavelengths,

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:33.948
leaving us with blue at the far depths.

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:37.766
In this clip you can see
two other important elements.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.812
The first is the surge and swell,

00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:41.553
or the invisible underwater current

00:04:41.577 --> 00:04:44.762
that pushes the bits of particulate
around in the water.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.803
The second is the caustics.

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.337
These are the ribbons of light,

00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:50.385
like you might see
on the bottom of a pool,

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.959
that are created when the sun
bends through the crests

00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:55.657
of the ripples and waves
on the ocean's surface.

00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:58.336
Here we have the fog beams.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.015
These give us color depth cues,

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.134
but also tells which direction is up

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:04.434
in shots where we don't
see the water surface.

00:05:04.788 --> 00:05:06.907
The other really cool thing
you can see here

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.091
is that we lit that particulate
only with the caustics,

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:12.773
so that as it goes in and out
of those ribbons of light,

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:14.310
it appears and disappears,

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:17.403
lending a subtle, magical
sparkle to the underwater.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.072
You can see how we're using the science --

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:23.972
the physics of water,
light and movement --

00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:26.042
to tether that artistic freedom.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.891
But we are not beholden to it.

00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:30.714
We considered each of these elements

00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:33.752
and which ones had to be
scientifically accurate

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:37.858
and which ones we could push and pull
to suit the story and the mood.

00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:41.691
We realized early on that color
was one we had some leeway with.

00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:44.327
So here's a traditionally colored
underwater scene.

00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:47.192
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor
and push it fairly green

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:49.476
to suit the sad mood of what's happening.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.574
In this scene, it's really important
we see deep into the underwater,

00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:56.265
so we understand what
the East Australian Current is,

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.677
that the turtles are diving into
and going on this roller coaster ride.

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:01.638
So we pushed the visibility of the water

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:04.365
well past anything you would
ever see in real life.

00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:06.005
Because in the end,

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.653
we are not trying to recreate
the scientifically correct real world,

00:06:10.677 --> 00:06:12.717
we're trying to create a believable world,

00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.688
one the audience can immerse
themselves in to experience the story.

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:20.067
We use science to create
something wonderful.

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:24.818
We use story and artistic touch
to get us to a place of wonder.

00:06:25.578 --> 00:06:28.054
This guy, WALL-E, is a great
example of that.

00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:30.508
He finds beauty in the simplest things.

00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:33.621
But when he came in to lighting,
we knew we had a big problem.

00:06:33.978 --> 00:06:37.423
We got so geeked-out on making
WALL-E this convincing robot,

00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:40.827
that we made his binoculars
practically optically perfect.

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:42.381
(Laughter)

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:47.322
His binoculars are one of the most
critical acting devices he has.

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:50.888
He doesn't have a face or even
traditional dialogue, for that matter.

00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:53.839
So the animators were heavily
dependent on the binoculars

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:56.116
to sell his acting and emotions.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.219
We started lighting and we realized

00:06:58.243 --> 00:07:02.457
the triple lenses inside his binoculars
were a mess of reflections.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.042
He was starting to look glassy-eyed.

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.790
(Laughter)

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:10.228
Now, glassy-eyed
is a fundamentally awful thing

00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:12.268
when you are trying
to convince an audience

00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:15.775
that a robot has a personality
and he's capable of falling in love.

00:07:16.498 --> 00:07:20.022
So we went to work on these optically
perfect binoculars,

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:23.748
trying to find a solution that would
maintain his true robot materials

00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:25.763
but solve this reflection problem.

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:27.554
So we started with the lenses.

00:07:27.578 --> 00:07:28.970
Here's the flat-front lens,

00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:30.500
we have a concave lens

00:07:30.524 --> 00:07:31.781
and a convex lens.

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:33.910
And here you see all three together,

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:35.819
showing us all these reflections.

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:37.838
We tried turning them down,

00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:39.558
we tried blocking them,

00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:41.022
nothing was working.

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:42.937
You can see here,

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:46.085
sometimes we needed something specific
reflected in his eyes --

00:07:46.109 --> 00:07:47.260
usually Eve.

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:50.815
So we couldn't just use some faked
abstract image on the lenses.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.989
So here we have Eve on the first lens,

00:07:53.013 --> 00:07:55.064
we put Eve on the second lens,

00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:56.333
it's not working.

00:07:56.357 --> 00:07:57.517
We turn it down,

00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.217
it's still not working.

00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.571
And then we have our eureka moment.

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:05.411
We add a light to WALL-E
that accidentally leaks into his eyes.

00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:09.482
You can see it light up
these gray aperture blades.

00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:13.560
Suddenly, those aperture blades
are poking through that reflection

00:08:13.584 --> 00:08:15.369
the way nothing else has.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:19.508
Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:22.181
As humans we have the white of our eye,

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:23.356
the colored iris

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.601
and the black pupil.

00:08:24.948 --> 00:08:28.289
Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,

00:08:28.313 --> 00:08:29.840
the gray aperture blades

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:31.283
and the black pupil.

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:35.331
Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:38.233
like there's a character
with emotion inside.

00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:41.855
Later in the movie towards the end,

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.357
WALL-E loses his personality,

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:44.959
essentially going dead.

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.910
This is the perfect time to bring back
that glassy-eyed look.

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:52.033
In the next scene,
WALL-E comes back to life.

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:55.240
We bring that light back to bring
the aperture blades back,

00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:58.724
and he returns to that sweet,
soulful robot we've come to love.

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:03.808
(Video) WALL-E: Eva?

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.961
Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty
in these unexpected moments --

00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:13.551
when you find the key
to unlocking a robot's soul,

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:16.738
the moment when you discover
what you want to do with your life.

00:09:17.135 --> 00:09:20.437
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo"
was one of those moments for me.

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:24.052
There are scenes in every movie
that struggle to come together.

00:09:24.076 --> 00:09:26.011
This was one of those scenes.

00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:28.169
The director had a vision for this scene

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:32.001
based on some wonderful footage
of jellyfish in the South Pacific.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.996
As we went along,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.473
we were floundering.

00:09:36.497 --> 00:09:38.586
The reviews with the director

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.299
turned from the normal
look-and-feel conversation

00:09:41.323 --> 00:09:45.450
into more and more questions
about numbers and percentages.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.776
Maybe because unlike normal,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.053
we were basing it on
something in real life,

00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:52.662
or maybe just because we had lost our way.

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.797
But it had become about using
our brain without our eyes,

00:09:55.821 --> 00:09:57.676
the science without the art.

00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:01.430
That scientific tether
was strangling the scene.

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:04.380
But even through all the frustrations,

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.439
I still believed it could be beautiful.

00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:08.122
So when it came in to lighting,

00:10:08.146 --> 00:10:09.377
I dug in.

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:13.440
As I worked to balance
the blues and the pinks,

00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:16.280
the caustics dancing
on the jellyfish bells,

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:18.478
the undulating fog beams,

00:10:18.502 --> 00:10:20.924
something promising began to appear.

00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:24.913
I came in one morning and checked
the previous night's work.

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:26.413
And I got excited.

00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:28.545
And then I showed it
to the lighting director

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:29.744
and she got excited.

00:10:29.768 --> 00:10:34.184
Soon, I was showing to the director
in a dark room full of 50 people.

00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:35.826
In director review,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.908
you hope you might get some nice words,

00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:40.645
then you get some notes
and fixes, generally.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.845
And then, hopefully, you get a final,

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:45.917
signaling to move on to the next stage.

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:49.830
I gave my intro, and I played
the jellyfish scene.

00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:54.555
And the director was silent
for an uncomfortably long amount of time.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.747
Just long enough for me to think,

00:10:57.771 --> 00:10:59.627
"Oh no, this is doomed."

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.679
And then he started clapping.

00:11:03.381 --> 00:11:05.773
And then the production
designer started clapping.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.384
And then the whole room was clapping.

00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:17.371
This is the moment
that I live for in lighting.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:19.558
The moment where it all comes together

00:11:19.582 --> 00:11:22.229
and we get a world that we can believe in.

00:11:22.718 --> 00:11:26.606
We use math, science and code
to create these amazing worlds.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.876
We use storytelling and art
to bring them to life.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.451
It's this interweaving of art and science

00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:38.138
that elevates the world
to a place of wonder,

00:11:38.162 --> 00:11:39.795
a place with soul,

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.589
a place we can believe in,

00:11:42.262 --> 00:11:45.603
a place where the things
you imagine can become real --

00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:50.283
and a world where a girl suddenly realizes

00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:52.467
not only is she a scientist,

00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:53.806
but also an artist.

00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:55.695
Thank you.

00:11:55.719 --> 00:11:58.999
(Applause)
