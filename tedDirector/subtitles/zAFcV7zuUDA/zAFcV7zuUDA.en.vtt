00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:17.743
I'm used to thinking of the TED audience

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.451
as a wonderful collection
of some of the most effective,

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.236
intelligent, intellectual, savvy,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.354
worldly and innovative
people in the world.

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:26.895
And I think that's true.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.679
However, I also have reason to believe
that many, if not most, of you

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:34.132
are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:35.236
(Laughter)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.192
Now I know that seems ludicrous.

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:39.679
I know that seems ludicrous.

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:43.399
And believe me, I lived the same sad life
until about three years ago.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.407
And what happened to me

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:48.835
was I bought, what was for me,
a very expensive pair of shoes.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.775
But those shoes came
with round nylon laces,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.236
and I couldn't keep them tied.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.616
So I went back to the store
and said to the owner,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.854
"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:00.602
He took a look and said,
"Oh, you're tying them wrong."

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.817
Now up until that moment,

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.499
I would have thought that, by age 50,

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.630
one of the life skills
that I had really nailed

00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:09.869
was tying my shoes.

00:01:09.893 --> 00:01:10.894
(Laughter)

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:13.116
But not so -- let me demonstrate.

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.125
This is the way

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.149
that most of us
were taught to tie our shoes.

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:24.776
Now as it turns out -- thank you.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.925
(Applause)

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:27.709
Wait, there's more.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.211
As it turns out --

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:30.236
(Laughter)

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.348
there's a strong form
and a weak form of this knot,

00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:34.957
and we were taught the weak form.

00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:36.236
And here's how to tell.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.951
If you pull the strands
at the base of the knot,

00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.236
you will see that the bow
will orient itself

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.236
down the long axis of the shoe.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.518
That's the weak form of the knot.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:46.685
But not to worry.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.724
If we start over

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:54.182
and simply go the other direction
around the bow,

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:57.190
we get this, the strong form of the knot.

00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:59.355
And if you pull the cords under the knot,

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.101
you will see that the bow orients itself

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.156
along the transverse axis of the shoe.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.204
This is a stronger knot.

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:08.220
It will come untied less often.

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:12.078
It will let you down less,
and not only that, it looks better.

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:14.673
We're going to do this one more time.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:18.095
(Applause)

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.412
Start as usual --

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:21.706
(Applause)

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.627
go the other way around the loop.

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:25.378
This is a little hard for children,

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.896
but I think you can handle it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.340
Pull the knot.

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:34.236
There it is: the strong form
of the shoe knot.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.236
Now, in keeping with today's theme,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.791
I'd like to point out --
something you already know --

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:44.647
that sometimes a small advantage
someplace in life

00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.464
can yield tremendous results
someplace else.

00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:48.563
(Laughter)

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:49.993
Live long and prosper.

00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:52.934
(Applause)
