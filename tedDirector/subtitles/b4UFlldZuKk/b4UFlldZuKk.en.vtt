00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.306
I would like to share with you today

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.460
a project that has changed how I approach

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.371
and practice architecture:

00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:21.299
the Fez River Rehabilitation Project.

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:23.640
My hometown of Fez, Morocco,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.307
boasts one of the largest walled
medieval cities in the world,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:30.036
called the medina, nestled in a river valley.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.634
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.610
Since the 1950s, as the
population of the medina grew,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.530
basic urban infrastructure

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.460
such as green open spaces and sewage

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.110
quickly changed and got highly stressed.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.065
One of the biggest casualties of the situation

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:54.028
was the Fez River, which bisects
the medina in its middle

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:57.000
and has been considered for many centuries

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.572
as the city's very soul.

00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:01.990
In fact, one can witness the presence

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.170
of the river's extensive water network

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.451
all throughout the city,

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:10.072
in places such as private and public fountains.

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:13.921
Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.357
it has been covered little by little

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:19.431
by concrete slabs since 1952.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.859
This process of erasure was coupled

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.895
with the destruction of many houses

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:26.387
along the river banks

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:28.376
to be able to make machineries

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:33.040
enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.335
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:38.291
or trash yards.

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.260
Actually, the state of the river

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.535
before entering the medina is pretty healthy.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.830
Then pollution takes its toll,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.249
mainly due to untreated sewage

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.900
and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.950
At some point, I couldn't bear

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.605
the desecration of the river,

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:58.335
such an important part of my city,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:01:59.986
and I decided to take action,

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:02.321
especially after I heard that the city

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:05.415
received a grant to divert sewage water

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:07.035
and to treat it.

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:08.992
With clean water, suddenly

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:11.467
the uncovering of the river became possible,

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.347
and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,

00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:16.563
my partner Takako Tajima and I

00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:20.194
were commissioned by the city to
work with a team of engineers

00:02:20.194 --> 00:02:22.302
to uncover the river.

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:24.257
However, we were sneaky,

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:25.574
and we proposed more:

00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:30.250
to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.210
and then to connect these pathways

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.853
back to the city fabric,

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.406
and finally to convert the urban voids

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.837
along the riverbanks into public spaces

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:42.187
that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:43.954
I will show you briefly now

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:46.991
two of these public spaces.

00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.771
The first one is the Rcif Plaza,

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.853
which sits actually right on top of the river,

00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:55.890
which you can see here in dotted lines.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.557
This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub

00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:01.481
that actually compromised the urban integrity

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.849
of the medina, that has the largest

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.448
pedestrian network in the world.

00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:09.553
And right beyond the historic
bridge that you can see here,

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:11.364
right next to the plaza,

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:13.524
you can see that the river looked like

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:15.785
a river of trash.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.017
Instead, what we proposed is to make

00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:20.375
the plaza entirely pedestrian,

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.278
to cover it with recycled leather canopies,

00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:27.030
and to connect it to the banks of the river.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.914
The second site of intervention

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:31.920
is also an urban void along the river banks,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.267
and it used to be an illegal parking,

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:35.722
and we proposed to transform it

00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.797
into the first playground in the medina.

00:03:38.797 --> 00:03:42.525
The playground is constructed using recycled tires

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.360
and also is coupled with a constructed wetland

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.790
that not only cleans the water of the river

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.381
but also retains it when floods occur.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.412
As the project progressed and
received several design awards,

00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:56.680
new stakeholders intervened

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.458
and changed the project goals and design.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:03.240
The only way for us to be able to bring

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.532
the main goals of the project ahead

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:08.962
was for us to do something very unusual

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:10.874
that usually architects don't do.

00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:14.126
It was for us to take our design ego

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.602
and our sense of authorship

00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:17.736
and put it in the backseat

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.245
and to focus mainly on being activists

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:22.150
and on trying to coalesce

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.441
all of the agendas of stakeholders

00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:27.264
and focus on the main goals of the project:

00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:29.796
that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:31.790
and provide public spaces for all.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.282
We were actually very lucky,

00:04:33.282 --> 00:04:35.825
and many of those goals happened

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.418
or are in the process of happening.

00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:39.478
Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.169
This is how it looked like about six years ago.

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.251
This is how it looks like today.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.983
It's still under construction,

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:47.480
but actually it is heavily used

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.123
by the local population.

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:51.946
And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like

00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:53.831
when the project is completed.

00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:57.829
This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:59.651
Then after many years of work,

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.385
the river with clean water, uncovered.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.410
And finally, you can see here the river

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.851
when the project will be completed.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.292
So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.710
will keep on changing and adapting

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.938
to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.998
but we strongly believe that by reimagining

00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:19.439
the role and the agency of the architect,

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.398
we have set up the core idea
of the project into motion;

00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:25.907
that is, to transform the river from sewage

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:27.561
to public space for all,

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.733
thereby making sure that the city of Fez

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.960
will remain a living city for its inhabitants

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.120
rather than a mummified heritage.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.856
Thank you very much.

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:37.775
(Applause)
