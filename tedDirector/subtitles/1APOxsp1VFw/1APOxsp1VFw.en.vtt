00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.976
My title: "Queerer than we can
suppose: the strangeness of science."

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:35.558
"Queerer than we can suppose" comes
from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:40.360
who said, "Now, my own suspicion
is that the universe is not only queerer

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:44.443
than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose.

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:47.579
I suspect that there are more things
in heaven and earth

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:52.393
than are dreamed of, or can
be dreamed of, in any philosophy."

00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:59.028
Richard Feynman compared
the accuracy of quantum theories --

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:00.878
experimental predictions --

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:07.189
to specifying the width of North America
to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.718
This means that quantum theory
has got to be, in some sense, true.

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:14.677
Yet the assumptions
that quantum theory needs to make

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.140
in order to deliver those
predictions are so mysterious

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:21.918
that even Feynman himself
was moved to remark,

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:24.781
"If you think you understand
quantum theory,

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.432
you don't understand quantum theory."

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.076
It's so queer that physicists
resort to one or another

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.822
paradoxical interpretation of it.

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:39.871
David Deutsch, who's talking here,
in "The Fabric of Reality,"

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:44.976
embraces the many-worlds
interpretation of quantum theory,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.021
because the worst that you
can say about it

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.298
is that it's preposterously wasteful.

00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:55.727
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing
number of universes existing in parallel,

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:57.562
mutually undetectable,

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:04.005
except through the narrow porthole
of quantum mechanical experiments.

00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:06.976
And that's Richard Feynman.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.769
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes

00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:12.508
that the queerness of modern physics

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.218
is just an extreme example.

00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:16.542
Science, as opposed to technology,

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.239
does violence to common sense.

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.890
Every time you drink a glass
of water, he points out,

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:26.395
the odds are that you will imbibe
at least one molecule

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.377
that passed through the bladder
of Oliver Cromwell.

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.208
(Laughter)

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:33.459
It's just elementary probability theory.

00:02:33.483 --> 00:02:34.659
(Laughter)

00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:37.900
The number of molecules
per glassful is hugely greater

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.710
than the number of glassfuls,
or bladdersful, in the world.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.944
And of course, there's nothing special
about Cromwell or bladders --

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:47.397
you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom

00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:50.976
that passed through the right lung
of the third iguanodon

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.709
to the left of the tall cycad tree.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:58.878
"Queerer than we can suppose."

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:03.326
What is it that makes us
capable of supposing anything,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.890
and does this tell us anything
about what we can suppose?

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:13.082
Are there things about the universe
that will be forever beyond our grasp,

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:16.473
but not beyond the grasp
of some superior intelligence?

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:18.186
Are there things about the universe

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.457
that are, in principle,
ungraspable by any mind,

00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.000
however superior?

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:30.159
The history of science has been
one long series of violent brainstorms,

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:33.283
as successive generations
have come to terms with

00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:36.150
increasing levels of queerness
in the universe.

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:39.913
We're now so used to the idea
that the Earth spins,

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:42.268
rather than the Sun moves across the sky,

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:43.601
it's hard for us to realize

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:47.107
what a shattering mental revolution
that must have been.

00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:50.834
After all, it seems obvious
that the Earth is large and motionless,

00:03:50.858 --> 00:03:52.637
the Sun, small and mobile.

00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:57.246
But it's worth recalling
Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.249
"Tell me," he asked a friend,
"why do people always say

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:05.348
it was natural for man to assume
that the Sun went 'round the Earth,

00:04:05.372 --> 00:04:08.031
rather than that the Earth was rotating?"

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:10.871
And his friend replied, "Well, obviously,

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:14.489
because it just looks as though
the Sun is going round the Earth."

00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:18.876
Wittgenstein replied, "Well,
what would it have looked like

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.412
if it had looked as though
the Earth was rotating?"

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:26.411
(Laughter)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.027
Science has taught us,
against all intuition,

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.452
that apparently solid things,
like crystals and rocks,

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:37.357
are really almost entirely
composed of empty space.

00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:42.001
And the familiar illustration
is the nucleus of an atom

00:04:42.025 --> 00:04:45.140
is a fly in the middle
of a sports stadium,

00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:48.191
and the next atom
is in the next sports stadium.

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:52.084
So it would seem the hardest,
solidest, densest rock

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:55.697
is really almost entirely empty space,

00:04:55.721 --> 00:05:00.295
broken only by tiny particles
so widely spaced they shouldn't count.

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:04.970
Why, then, do rocks look and feel
solid and hard and impenetrable?

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.874
As an evolutionary biologist,
I'd say this: our brains have evolved

00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:16.976
to help us survive within the orders
of magnitude, of size and speed

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.740
which our bodies operate at.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:22.068
We never evolved to navigate
in the world of atoms.

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:25.417
If we had, our brains
probably would perceive rocks

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:26.887
as full of empty space.

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.355
Rocks feel hard and impenetrable

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.976
to our hands, precisely because
objects like rocks and hands

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.877
cannot penetrate each other.

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:38.329
It's therefore useful

00:05:38.353 --> 00:05:44.479
for our brains to construct notions
like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"

00:05:44.503 --> 00:05:47.976
because such notions help us
to navigate our bodies

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.247
through the middle-sized world
in which we have to navigate.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.421
Moving to the other end of the scale,

00:05:54.445 --> 00:05:57.835
our ancestors never had to navigate
through the cosmos

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.223
at speeds close to the speed of light.

00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:04.853
If they had, our brains would be
much better at understanding Einstein.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:10.266
I want to give the name "Middle World"
to the medium-scaled environment

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.688
in which we've evolved
the ability to take act --

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:14.439
nothing to do with "Middle Earth" --

00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:15.614
Middle World.

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:16.976
(Laughter)

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.009
We are evolved denizens of Middle World,

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:23.509
and that limits what
we are capable of imagining.

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:26.314
We find it intuitively easy
to grasp ideas like,

00:06:26.338 --> 00:06:29.103
when a rabbit moves
at the sort of medium velocity

00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:31.976
at which rabbits and other
Middle World objects move,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.852
and hits another Middle World object
like a rock, it knocks itself out.

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:43.608
May I introduce Major General
Albert Stubblebine III,

00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:47.965
commander of military
intelligence in 1983.

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:53.723
"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington,
Virginia, and decided to do it.

00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:59.304
As frightening as the prospect was,
he was going into the next office.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:04.008
He stood up and moved
out from behind his desk.

00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:08.920
'What is the atom mostly made of?'
he thought, 'Space.'

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:14.594
He started walking. 'What am I
mostly made of? Atoms.'

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.498
He quickened his pace,
almost to a jog now.

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:20.526
'What is the wall mostly made of?'

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.551
(Laughter)

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:22.725
'Atoms!'

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:26.850
All I have to do is merge the spaces.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:33.656
Then, General Stubblebine banged
his nose hard on the wall of his office.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.278
Stubblebine, who commanded
16,000 soldiers,

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:42.229
was confounded by his continual failure
to walk through the wall.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.321
He has no doubt that this ability
will one day be a common tool

00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:46.972
in the military arsenal.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:50.811
Who would screw around with an army
that could do that?"

00:07:50.835 --> 00:07:52.804
That's from an article in Playboy,

00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:54.543
which I was reading the other day.

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:56.174
(Laughter)

00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:58.094
I have every reason to think it's true;

00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:01.606
I was reading Playboy because I, myself,
had an article in it.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:07.491
(Laughter)

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:12.165
Unaided human intuition,
schooled in Middle World,

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:15.496
finds it hard to believe Galileo
when he tells us

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.914
a heavy object and a light object,
air friction aside,

00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:20.914
would hit the ground at the same instant.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:24.492
And that's because in Middle World,
air friction is always there.

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:25.865
If we'd evolved in a vacuum,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.695
we would expect them to hit
the ground simultaneously.

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:30.619
If we were bacteria,

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.958
constantly buffeted by thermal
movements of molecules,

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:35.133
it would be different.

00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:38.435
But we Middle-Worlders are too big
to notice Brownian motion.

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:42.206
In the same way, our lives
are dominated by gravity,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.525
but are almost oblivious
to the force of surface tension.

00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:48.676
A small insect would reverse
these priorities.

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.520
Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left,

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:54.099
Douglas Adams is on the right.

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:57.821
Steve Grand, in his book,
"Creation: Life and How to Make It,"

00:08:57.845 --> 00:09:02.648
is positively scathing about our
preoccupation with matter itself.

00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:07.337
We have this tendency to think
that only solid, material things

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:09.242
are really things at all.

00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:14.242
Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation
in a vacuum seem unreal.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.596
Victorians thought the waves
had to be waves in some material medium:

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.770
the ether.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.747
But we find real matter comforting

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:27.738
only because we've evolved
to survive in Middle World,

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:30.508
where matter is a useful fiction.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.238
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand,
is a thing with just as much reality

00:09:35.262 --> 00:09:36.412
as a rock.

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.628
In a desert plain in Tanzania,

00:09:40.652 --> 00:09:43.842
in the shadow of the volcano
Ol Doinyo Lengai,

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.923
there's a dune made of volcanic ash.

00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:49.651
The beautiful thing
is that it moves bodily.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.207
It's what's technically known
as a "barchan,"

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.435
and the entire dune walks
across the desert in a westerly direction

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:59.459
at a speed of about 17 meters per year.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:04.316
It retains its crescent shape and moves
in the direction of the horns.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.316
What happens is that the wind blows
the sand up the shallow slope

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.548
on the other side,

00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:13.317
and then, as each sand grain hits
the top of the ridge, it cascades down

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:14.799
on the inside of the crescent,

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.819
and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:23.293
Steve Grand points out
that you and I are, ourselves,

00:10:23.317 --> 00:10:26.249
more like a wave than a permanent thing.

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:28.728
He invites us, the reader,

00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:31.157
to think of an experience
from your childhood,

00:10:31.181 --> 00:10:32.739
something you remember clearly,

00:10:32.763 --> 00:10:35.797
something you can see,
feel, maybe even smell,

00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:37.536
as if you were really there.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.333
After all, you really were there
at the time, weren't you?

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:43.461
How else would you remember it?

00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:46.143
But here is the bombshell:
You weren't there.

00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:48.584
Not a single atom
that is in your body today

00:10:48.608 --> 00:10:51.118
was there when that event took place.

00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:53.285
Matter flows from place to place

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:56.237
and momentarily comes together to be you.

00:10:56.261 --> 00:10:57.613
Whatever you are, therefore,

00:10:57.637 --> 00:11:01.719
you are not the stuff
of which you are made.

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.791
If that doesn't make the hair stand up
on the back of your neck,

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:08.131
read it again until it does,
because it is important.

00:11:09.283 --> 00:11:13.377
So "really" isn't a word that we should
use with simple confidence.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.272
If a neutrino had a brain,

00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:19.038
which it evolved
in neutrino-sized ancestors,

00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:23.063
it would say that rocks really
do consist of empty space.

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:26.626
We have brains that evolved
in medium-sized ancestors

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.650
which couldn't walk through rocks.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.650
"Really," for an animal, is whatever
its brain needs it to be

00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:35.674
in order to assist its survival.

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:38.822
And because different species
live in different worlds,

00:11:38.846 --> 00:11:42.933
there will be a discomforting
variety of "reallys."

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.607
What we see of the real world
is not the unvarnished world,

00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:53.912
but a model of the world,
regulated and adjusted by sense data,

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:57.919
but constructed so it's useful
for dealing with the real world.

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:01.617
The nature of the model depends
on the kind of animal we are.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.633
A flying animal needs
a different kind of model

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:08.357
from a walking, climbing
or swimming animal.

00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:12.801
A monkey's brain must have
software capable of simulating

00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:16.120
a three-dimensional world
of branches and trunks.

00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:20.521
A mole's software for constructing models
of its world will be customized

00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:22.497
for underground use.

00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:26.388
A water strider's brain
doesn't need 3D software at all,

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.562
since it lives on the surface of the pond,

00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:30.906
in an Edwin Abbott flatland.

00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:36.681
I've speculated that bats may see
color with their ears.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.584
The world model that a bat needs
in order to navigate

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:42.585
through three dimensions catching insects

00:12:42.609 --> 00:12:45.682
must be pretty similar to the world
model that any flying bird --

00:12:45.706 --> 00:12:49.584
a day-flying bird like a swallow --
needs to perform the same kind of tasks.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.290
The fact that the bat uses
echoes in pitch darkness

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.081
to input the current
variables to its model,

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:58.874
while the swallow uses
light, is incidental.

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:04.734
Bats, I've even suggested, use
perceived hues, such as red and blue,

00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:10.873
as labels, internal labels,
for some useful aspect of echoes --

00:13:10.897 --> 00:13:15.444
perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces,
furry or smooth and so on --

00:13:15.468 --> 00:13:20.031
in the same way as swallows or indeed,
we, use those perceived hues --

00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:21.659
redness and blueness, etc. --

00:13:21.683 --> 00:13:24.555
to label long and short
wavelengths of light.

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:27.906
There's nothing inherent about red
that makes it long wavelength.

00:13:28.747 --> 00:13:32.971
The point is that the nature of the model
is governed by how it is to be used,

00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:36.882
rather than by the sensory
modality involved.

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.691
J.B.S. Haldane himself had
something to say about animals

00:13:40.715 --> 00:13:43.000
whose world is dominated by smell.

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:49.369
Dogs can distinguish two very similar
fatty acids, extremely diluted:

00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:52.077
caprylic acid and caproic acid.

00:13:52.101 --> 00:13:53.499
The only difference, you see,

00:13:53.523 --> 00:13:56.807
is that one has an extra pair
of carbon atoms in the chain.

00:13:56.831 --> 00:14:01.319
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably
be able to place the acids

00:14:01.343 --> 00:14:04.787
in the order of their molecular
weights by their smells,

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.933
just as a man could place
a number of piano wires

00:14:07.957 --> 00:14:11.162
in the order of their lengths
by means of their notes.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:15.513
Now, there's another
fatty acid, capric acid,

00:14:15.537 --> 00:14:17.149
which is just like the other two,

00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:19.727
except that it has two more carbon atoms.

00:14:20.481 --> 00:14:23.304
A dog that had never met
capric acid would, perhaps,

00:14:23.328 --> 00:14:26.281
have no more trouble imagining its smell

00:14:26.305 --> 00:14:29.461
than we would have trouble
imagining a trumpet, say,

00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:33.875
playing one note higher than we've heard
a trumpet play before.

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:42.831
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other
smell-oriented animals smell in color.

00:14:43.268 --> 00:14:46.133
And the argument would be exactly
the same as for the bats.

00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:51.940
Middle World -- the range
of sizes and speeds

00:14:51.964 --> 00:14:55.552
which we have evolved to feel
intuitively comfortable with --

00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:59.344
is a bit like the narrow range
of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:14:59.368 --> 00:15:02.196
that we see as light of various colors.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.540
We're blind to all
frequencies outside that,

00:15:04.564 --> 00:15:07.068
unless we use instruments to help us.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.142
Middle World is the narrow
range of reality

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:15.420
which we judge to be normal,
as opposed to the queerness

00:15:15.444 --> 00:15:19.004
of the very small, the very large
and the very fast.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.849
We could make a similar
scale of improbabilities;

00:15:22.873 --> 00:15:25.484
nothing is totally impossible.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.769
Miracles are just events
that are extremely improbable.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.059
A marble statue could wave its hand at us;

00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:34.946
the atoms that make up
its crystalline structure

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.187
are all vibrating back and forth anyway.

00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:38.869
Because there are so many of them,

00:15:38.893 --> 00:15:40.976
and because there's no
agreement among them

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.076
in their preferred direction of movement,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.165
the marble, as we see it
in Middle World, stays rock steady.

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:49.799
But the atoms in the hand
could all just happen to move

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:52.447
the same way at the same time,
and again and again.

00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:54.120
In this case, the hand would move,

00:15:54.144 --> 00:15:57.927
and we'd see it waving at us
in Middle World.

00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:00.537
The odds against it,
of course, are so great

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:05.041
that if you set out writing zeros
at the time of the origin of the universe,

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:08.080
you still would not have written
enough zeros to this day.

00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:12.234
Evolution in Middle World
has not equipped us

00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:15.885
to handle very improbable events;
we don't live long enough.

00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:21.188
In the vastness of astronomical space
and geological time,

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:24.010
that which seems impossible
in Middle World

00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:26.283
might turn out to be inevitable.

00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:31.700
One way to think about that
is by counting planets.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.406
We don't know how many planets
there are in the universe,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.881
but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20,
or 100 billion billion.

00:16:38.374 --> 00:16:43.323
And that gives us a nice way to express
our estimate of life's improbability.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.403
We could make some sort of landmark points
along a spectrum of improbability,

00:16:48.427 --> 00:16:52.703
which might look like the electromagnetic
spectrum we just looked at.

00:16:53.568 --> 00:16:56.409
If life has arisen only once on any --

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:03.073
life could originate once per planet,
could be extremely common

00:17:03.097 --> 00:17:05.661
or it could originate once per star

00:17:05.685 --> 00:17:10.677
or once per galaxy or maybe only
once in the entire universe,

00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:12.886
in which case it would have to be here.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.961
And somewhere up there would be the chance

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.786
that a frog would turn into a prince,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.691
and similar magical things like that.

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:24.075
If life has arisen on only one planet
in the entire universe,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.095
that planet has to be our planet,
because here we are talking about it.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.771
And that means that if we want
to avail ourselves of it,

00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:34.632
we're allowed to postulate chemical events
in the origin of life

00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:38.536
which have a probability as low
as one in 100 billion billion.

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:41.669
I don't think we shall have
to avail ourselves of that,

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:44.660
because I suspect that life
is quite common in the universe.

00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:47.722
And when I say quite common,
it could still be so rare

00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:51.871
that no one island of life
ever encounters another,

00:17:51.895 --> 00:17:53.475
which is a sad thought.

00:17:54.665 --> 00:17:57.928
How shall we interpret
"queerer than we can suppose?"

00:17:58.397 --> 00:18:00.652
Queerer than can in principle be supposed,

00:18:00.676 --> 00:18:04.114
or just queerer than we can suppose,
given the limitations

00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:08.400
of our brain's evolutionary
apprenticeship in Middle World?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.854
Could we, by training and practice,

00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:13.068
emancipate ourselves from Middle World

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:17.735
and achieve some sort of intuitive
as well as mathematical understanding

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.898
of the very small and the very large?

00:18:19.922 --> 00:18:22.034
I genuinely don't know the answer.

00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:25.692
I wonder whether we might help ourselves
to understand, say, quantum theory,

00:18:25.716 --> 00:18:28.976
if we brought up children
to play computer games

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.582
beginning in early childhood,

00:18:30.606 --> 00:18:34.527
which had a make-believe world of balls
going through two slits on a screen,

00:18:34.551 --> 00:18:38.539
a world in which the strange goings-on
of quantum mechanics were enlarged

00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:40.457
by the computer's make-believe,

00:18:40.481 --> 00:18:44.326
so that they became familiar
on the Middle-World scale of the stream.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.904
And similarly, a relativistic
computer game,

00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:52.244
in which objects on the screen manifest
the Lorentz contraction, and so on,

00:18:52.268 --> 00:18:56.692
to try to get ourselves -- to get children
into the way of thinking about it.

00:18:57.124 --> 00:19:01.005
I want to end by applying
the idea of Middle World

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:03.000
to our perceptions of each other.

00:19:03.735 --> 00:19:08.022
Most scientists today subscribe
to a mechanistic view of the mind:

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:11.450
we're the way we are because our brains
are wired up as they are,

00:19:11.474 --> 00:19:13.126
our hormones are the way they are.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.661
We'd be different, our characters
would be different,

00:19:15.685 --> 00:19:19.548
if our neuro-anatomy and our
physiological chemistry were different.

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.884
But we scientists are inconsistent.

00:19:22.424 --> 00:19:23.805
If we were consistent,

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:27.142
our response to a misbehaving
person, like a child-murderer,

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.500
should be something like:

00:19:28.524 --> 00:19:31.770
this unit has a faulty component;
it needs repairing.

00:19:31.794 --> 00:19:32.976
That's not what we say.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.163
What we say -- and I include
the most austerely mechanistic among us,

00:19:37.187 --> 00:19:38.401
which is probably me --

00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:42.235
what we say is, "Vile monster,
prison is too good for you."

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:45.976
Or worse, we seek revenge,
in all probability thereby triggering

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.570
the next phase in an escalating
cycle of counter-revenge,

00:19:49.594 --> 00:19:52.052
which we see, of course,
all over the world today.

00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:54.772
In short, when we're
thinking like academics,

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:58.095
we regard people as elaborate
and complicated machines,

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:00.264
like computers or cars.

00:20:00.663 --> 00:20:02.677
But when we revert to being human,

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.412
we behave more like Basil Fawlty,
who, we remember,

00:20:06.436 --> 00:20:08.275
thrashed his car to teach it a lesson,

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:10.574
when it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."

00:20:10.598 --> 00:20:11.951
(Laughter)

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:16.292
The reason we personify things
like cars and computers

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:19.684
is that just as monkeys live
in an arboreal world

00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:22.370
and moles live in an underground world

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:26.208
and water striders live in a surface
tension-dominated flatland,

00:20:26.232 --> 00:20:28.361
we live in a social world.

00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:30.571
We swim through a sea of people --

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:32.928
a social version of Middle World.

00:20:33.562 --> 00:20:37.277
We are evolved to second-guess
the behavior of others

00:20:37.301 --> 00:20:41.028
by becoming brilliant,
intuitive psychologists.

00:20:41.464 --> 00:20:42.856
Treating people as machines

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.395
may be scientifically
and philosophically accurate,

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.332
but it's a cumbersome waste of time

00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:51.517
if you want to guess what this person
is going to do next.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.976
The economically useful way
to model a person

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.611
is to treat him as a purposeful,
goal-seeking agent

00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:01.051
with pleasures and pains,
desires and intentions,

00:21:01.075 --> 00:21:02.757
guilt, blame-worthiness.

00:21:03.456 --> 00:21:07.566
Personification and the imputing
of intentional purpose

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.233
is such a brilliantly successful
way to model humans,

00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:14.378
it's hardly surprising
the same modeling software

00:21:14.402 --> 00:21:17.976
often seizes control when we're
trying to think about entities

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.371
for which it's not appropriate,
like Basil Fawlty with his car

00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:26.336
or like millions of deluded people,
with the universe as a whole.

00:21:26.717 --> 00:21:28.976
(Laughter)

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.141
If the universe is queerer
than we can suppose,

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.667
is it just because
we've been naturally selected

00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:37.660
to suppose only what we needed to suppose

00:21:37.684 --> 00:21:40.000
in order to survive
in the Pleistocene of Africa?

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:46.563
Or are our brains so versatile
and expandable that we can train ourselves

00:21:46.587 --> 00:21:49.242
to break out of the box of our evolution?

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:54.322
Or finally, are there some things
in the universe so queer

00:21:54.346 --> 00:22:00.213
that no philosophy of beings,
however godlike, could dream them?
