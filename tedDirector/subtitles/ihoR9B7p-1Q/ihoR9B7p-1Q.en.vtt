00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.924
The entire model of capitalism

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:18.103
and the economic model that you and I

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:19.782
did business in,

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:21.609
and, in fact, continue to do business in,

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.232
was built around what probably Milton Friedman

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:26.950
put more succinctly.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.530
And Adam Smith, of course, 
the father of modern economics

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.879
actually said many, many years ago,

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.397
the invisible hand,

00:00:33.397 --> 00:00:35.053
which is, "If you continue to operate

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:37.166
in your own self-interest

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.922
you will do the best good for society."

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:44.653
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things

00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:47.455
and I've talked about a lot of good 
things that have happened,

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:50.841
but equally, it has not been able to meet up

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:52.777
with some of the challenges that we've seen

00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:54.438
in society.

00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.652
The model that at least I was brought up in

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:58.932
and a lot of us doing
business were brought up in

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:00.641
was one which talked about

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.069
what I call the three G's of growth:

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:04.658
growth that is consistent,

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:06.184
quarter on quarter;

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:07.622
growth that is competitive,

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:08.952
better than the other person;

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:10.514
and growth that is profitable,

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.003
so you continue to make

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.922
more and more shareholder value.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.714
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:20.374
and we have to move from this 3G model

00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:22.688
to a model of what I call

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:24.234
the fourth G:

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:28.123
the G of growth that is responsible.

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:31.560
And it is this that has to become

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800
a very important part

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.675
of creating value.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.400
Of not just creating economic value

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.854
but creating social value.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.654
And companies that will thrive are those

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:47.019
that will actually embrace the fourth G.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.044
And the model of 4G is quite simple:

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:53.816
Companies cannot afford 
to be just innocent bystanders

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:56.151
in what's happening around in society.

00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:59.718
They have to begin to play their role

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.878
in terms of serving the communities

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.976
which actually sustain them.

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:05.673
And we have to move to a model

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:07.766
of an and/and model which is

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.248
how do we make money and do good?

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:13.056
How do we make sure

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:14.636
that we have a great business

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.508
but we also have a great environment around us?

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:18.828
And that model

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:21.797
is all about doing well and doing good.

00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:24.118
But the question is easier said than done.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:26.255
But how do we actually get that done?

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:27.601
And I do believe

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.691
that the answer to that is going to be leadership.

00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.048
It is going to be to redefine

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:33.918
the new business models

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:35.264
which understand

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:37.269
that the only license to operate

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.406
is to combine these things.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:41.338
And for that you need businesses

00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:44.097
that can actually define their role

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.182
in society

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:47.826
in terms of a much larger purpose

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.657
than the products and brands that they sell.

00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:53.890
And companies that actually define a true north,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.636
things that are nonnegotiable

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:58.196
whether times are good, bad, ugly --

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.463
doesn't matter.

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:01.629
There are things that you stand for.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.121
Values and purpose are going to be the two

00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:08.256
drivers of software

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:09.968
that are going to create

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:12.034
the companies of tomorrow.

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:13.440
And I'm going to now shift

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.458
to talking a little bit about my own experiences.

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:20.338
I joined Unilever in 1976

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.471
as a management trainee in India.

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.806
And on my first day of work

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.140
I walked in and my boss tells me,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.247
"Do you know why you're here?"

00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:33.544
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:36.630
And he said, 
"No, you're here to change lives."

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.922
You're here to change lives.

00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:40.552
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:43.367
We are a company that sells soap and soup.

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:46.239
What are we doing about changing lives?

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.254
And it's then I realized

00:03:50.254 --> 00:03:52.577
that simple acts

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:55.009
like selling a bar of soap

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.498
can save more lives

00:03:56.498 --> 00:03:57.975
than pharmaceutical companies.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:03:59.597
I don't know how many of you know

00:03:59.597 --> 00:04:02.932
that five million children don't reach the age of five

00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:05.808
because of simple infections that can be prevented

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.748
by an act of washing their hands with soap.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.200
We run the largest

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.429
hand-washing program

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.334
in the world.

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:14.495
We are running a program on hygiene and health

00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:16.997
that now touches half a billion people.

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:18.597
It's not about selling soap,

00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:20.558
there is a larger purpose out there.

00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:22.616
And brands indeed can be

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.623
at the forefront of social change.

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:26.280
And the reason for that is,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.890
when two billion people use your brands

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.542
that's the amplifier.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.743
Small actions can make a big difference.

00:04:33.743 --> 00:04:35.281
Take another example,

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.551
I was walking around in 
one of our villages in India.

00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:40.194
Now those of you who have done this

00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:45.368
will realize that this is no walk in the park.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.943
And we had this lady

00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:52.083
who was one of our small distributors --

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.695
beautiful, very, very modest, her home --

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.103
and she was out there,

00:04:58.103 --> 00:04:59.655
dressed nicely,

00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:01.815
her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind

00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:04.041
and her sister-in-law behind her.

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.113
The social order was changing

00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:07.863
because this lady

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.999
is part of our Project Shakti

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.283
that is actually teaching women

00:05:12.283 --> 00:05:14.154
how to do small business

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:15.333
and how to carry the message

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.976
of nutrition and hygiene.

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:20.183
We have 60,000 such women

00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:22.035
now in India.

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:24.488
It's not about selling soap,

00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:25.941
it's about making sure

00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:27.981
that in the process of doing so

00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.174
you can change people's lives.

00:05:30.174 --> 00:05:33.371
Small actions, big difference.

00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.090
Our R&amp;D folks

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.719
are not only working to give us 
some fantastic detergents,

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.488
but they're working to make sure we use less water.

00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:43.652
A product that we've just launched recently,

00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:47.180
One Rinse product that allows you to save water

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.356
every time you wash your clothes.

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:52.381
And if we can convert all our users to using this,

00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:54.614
that's 500 billion liters of water.

00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:56.908
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water

00:05:56.908 --> 00:06:00.092
for a whole huge continent.

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:01.768
So just think about it.

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:05.335
There are small actions that 
can make a big difference.

00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:06.953
And I can go on and on.

00:06:06.953 --> 00:06:09.050
Our food chain, our brilliant products --

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.419
and I'm sorry I'm giving you 
a word from the sponsors --

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.121
Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.

00:06:15.121 --> 00:06:17.181
We are committed to making sure that

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:19.138
all our agricultural raw materials

00:06:19.138 --> 00:06:21.944
are sourced from sustainable sources,

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:24.044
100-percent sustainable sources.

00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:25.592
We were the first

00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:27.801
to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil

00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.763
from sustainable sources.

00:06:29.763 --> 00:06:33.683
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,

00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:36.096
and not buying it from sustainable sources,

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:38.701
can create deforestation that is responsible

00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:41.243
for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.759
We were the first to embrace that,

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.157
and it's all because we market soap and soup.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.355
And the point I'm making here

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:53.878
is that companies like yours, companies like mine

00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:56.001
have to define a purpose

00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:58.282
which embraces responsibility

00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:00.982
and understands that we have to play our part

00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:03.819
in the communities in which we operate.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.719
We introduced something called

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.463
The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,

00:07:08.463 --> 00:07:11.349
"Our purpose is to make 
sustainable living commonplace,

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.176
and we are gong to change the lives

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.901
of one billion people over 2020."

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:17.701
Now the question here is,

00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:19.225
where do we go from here?

00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:21.145
And the answer to that is very simple:

00:07:21.145 --> 00:07:23.278
We're not going to change the world alone.

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:25.868
There are plenty of you and plenty of us

00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:27.338
who understand this.

00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:28.503
The question is,

00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:31.134
we need partnerships, we need coalitions

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:33.590
and importantly, we need that leadership

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.550
that will allow us to take this from here

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.839
and to be the change

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.375
that we want to see around us.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.695
Thank you very much.

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:44.510
(Applause)
