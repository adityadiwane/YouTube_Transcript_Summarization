00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect --

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
it was called Natal -- I was inspired,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and I thought for a moment,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
maybe it's possible

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
to address that one problem of storytelling,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to create a character

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
which seemed alive,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
which noticed me,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that could look me in the eyes

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and feel real,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and sculpt a story about our relationship.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And so a year ago,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I showed this off

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
at a computer show called E3.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And this was a piece of technology

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And there was a huge row online

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
about, "Hey, this can't be real."

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And so I waited till now

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to have an actual demo

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
of the real tech.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Now, this tech incorporates

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
three big elements.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The first is a Kinect camera,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
which will be out in November,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
some incredible AI

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
that was hidden in the dusty vaults,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
collecting dust

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
in Microsoft,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
plus our quite crude

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
attempts at AI

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
at a company called Lionhead,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
mixing all those things together

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
just to get to this one simple idea:

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to create a real, living

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
being in a computer.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Now, I'll be honest with you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and say that most of it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is just a trick,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
but it's a trick that actually works.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So why don't we go over and have

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
a look at the demo now.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
This is Dimitri.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Now, you notice he's sitting.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
There are no controllers,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
no keyboards,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
or mice,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
or joysticks, or joypads.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
He is just going to use

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
his hand, his body and his voice,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So let's move forward.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We had to give him a problem

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
because when we first created Milo,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
to be honest with you.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
He was quite a know-it-all,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
So the problem we introduced to him was this:

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
he's just moved house.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
He's moved from London

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
to New England, over in America.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
His parents are too busy

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
to listen to his problems,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So here he is

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
walking through the grass.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And you're able to interact with his world.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
The cool thing is, what we're doing

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
is we're changing the mind

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
of Milo constantly.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
That means no two people's Milos

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
can be the same.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
You're actually sculpting a human being here.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So, he's discovering the garden.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
You're helping him discover the garden

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
by just pointing out these snails.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Very simple at the start.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
if you're a girl, it's butterflies

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
because what we found was that girls hate snails.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
(Laughter)

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
So remember, this is the first time you've met him,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
His face, by the way,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is fully AI-driven.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
We have complete control over his blush responses,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
the diameter of his nostrils

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
to denote stress.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
We actually do something called body matching.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
If you're leaning forward,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
he will try and slightly change

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
because we went out with this strong idea:

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
how can we make you believe that something's real?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Now we've used the hand.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
The other thing to use is your body.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
with a mouse or with a joypad,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
why not use your body just to lean on the chair --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
again, relaxed?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
You can lean back,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but the camera will change its perspective

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
depending on which way you're looking.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So Dimitri's now going to use --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
he's used his hand; he's used his body.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and that's his voice.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Now, the thing about voice is,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
our experience with voice recognition

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is pretty awful, isn't it?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
It never works.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So we've tackled that problem,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Milo: I could just squish it.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
but remember, even this choice

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
will affect how Milo develops.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Do you want Milo to squash it?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
When you see the microphone,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Now look at his response.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
What we're using there is,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
We've got a database of words which we recognize.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
We pick those words out.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We also reference that

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
with the tonation database

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that we build up of Dimitri's voice,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
or the user's voice.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Now we need to have a bit more engagement,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and again, what we can do

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
is we can look at the body.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And we'll do that in a second.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Milo: I wonder how deep it is.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Deep.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
is teach Milo to skim stones.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
We're actually teaching him.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It's very, very interesting

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
that men, more than women,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
tend to be more competitive here.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
but then they want to beat Milo,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
where women,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
they're more nurturing about this.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Okay, this is skimming stones.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
How do you skim stones?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
You stand up,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and you skim the stone.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
It's that simple.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Just recognizing your body,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
recognizing the body's motions, the tech,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
understanding that you've gone

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
from sitting down to standing up.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Again, all of this is done

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
in the way us humans do things,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and that's crucially important

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
if we want Milo to appear real.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Try hitting the boat.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
Milo: Ahhh. So close.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Milo: Okay.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
giving us time to be alone

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and to help him out.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
his parents had asked him to clean up his room.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And we're going to help him with this now.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But this is going to be an introduction,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
We're trying to introduce you

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
to what I believe is the most wonderful part,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
you being able to talk

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
in your natural voice to Milo.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Now, to do that, we needed a set up,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
like a magician's trick.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And what we did was,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
we needed to give Milo this big problem.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
So as Dimitri

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
starts tidying up,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
you can overhear a conversation

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
that Milo's having with his parents.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
PM: So he's just spilled

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
a plate of sausages on the floor,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
on the brand-new carpet.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Now's a chance for Dimitri

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
It's all been too much for him.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Now is the time

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
when we open that portal

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and allow you to talk to Milo.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
to cheer Milo up.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
They're always getting stressed.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
We don't know anyone.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Milo: It was good skimming stones.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
This looks nice.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
You cleaned up my room.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Thanks.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
he recognizes you.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
that is a truly wonderful moment.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And we're ready now

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
to tell a story about his childhood and his life,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and it goes on,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and he has, you know, many adventures.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
he's got to go to school.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
The cool thing is

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
that we're doing as well:

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
as you interact with him,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
His mind is based in a cloud.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
That means Milo's mind,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
as millions of people use it,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
will get smarter and cleverer.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
He'll recognize more objects

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and thus understand more words.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
But for me,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
this is a wonderful opportunity

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
where technology, at last, can be connected with,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
where I am no longer restrained

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
by the finger I hold in my hand --

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
as far as a computer game's concerned --

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
or by the blandness of not being noticed

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
if you're watching a film or a book.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And I love those revolutions,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and I love the future that Milo brings.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Thank you very much indeed.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
(Applause)
