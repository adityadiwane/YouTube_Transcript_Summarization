00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:18.216
Writing biography is a strange thing to do.

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:20.899
It's a journey into the foreign territory

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.095
of somebody else's life,

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.768
a journey, an exploration that can take you places

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:29.039
you never dreamed of going

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.264
and still can't quite believe you've been,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.992
especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:36.817
and the life you've been exploring

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:41.649
is that of Muhammad.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.080
Five years ago, for instance,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.348
I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:50.831
to what I knew was an impossible question:

00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:54.049
What actually happened

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.488
one desert night,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.082
half the world and almost half of history away?

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.802
What happened, that is,

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.120
on the night in the year 610

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.971
when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran

00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:11.048
on a mountain just outside Mecca?

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:15.653
This is the core mystical moment of Islam,

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:17.019
and as such, of course,

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:20.095
it defies empirical analysis.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:24.200
Yet the question wouldn't let go of me.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.384
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:29.263
just asking it could be seen

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.523
as pure chutzpah.

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:35.205
(Laughter)

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.816
And I plead guilty as charged,

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.847
because all exploration, physical or intellectual,

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:45.724
is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,

00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:49.121
of crossing boundaries.

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:55.136
Still, some boundaries are larger than others.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:58.056
So a human encountering the divine,

00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:01.178
as Muslims believe Muhammad did,

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:04.019
to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:05.776
but of wishful fiction,

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:09.714
and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.598
Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.375
we have of that night,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.194
what struck me even more than what happened

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:22.716
was what did not happen.

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:25.868
Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:28.818
as though walking on air.

00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:31.292
He did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!"

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:33.652
and "Bless the Lord!"

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:37.380
He did not radiate light and joy.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.959
There were no choirs of angels,

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.259
no music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.921
no golden aura surrounding him,

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.063
no sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:53.139
as the messenger of God.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.094
That is, he did none of the things

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.848
that might make it easy to cry foul,

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:03.995
to put down the whole story as a pious fable.

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:06.827
Quite the contrary.

00:03:06.827 --> 00:03:10.572
In his own reported words,

00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:12.949
he was convinced at first

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:18.230
that what had happened couldn't have been real.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.942
At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination --

00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:22.751
a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.926
or his own mind working against him.

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:27.103
At worst, possession --

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:29.392
that he'd been seized by an evil jinn,

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:31.183
a spirit out to deceive him,

00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:34.192
even to crush the life out of him.

00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:37.216
In fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.844
possessed by a jinn,

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.956
that when he found himself still alive,

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:45.805
his first impulse was to finish the job himself,

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:48.008
to leap off the highest cliff

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.126
and escape the terror of what he'd experienced

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:59.228
by putting an end to all experience.

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:02.148
So the man who fled down the mountain that night

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:04.599
trembled not with joy

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.319
but with a stark, primordial fear.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.239
He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.040
And that panicked disorientation,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.919
that sundering of everything familiar,

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.587
that daunting awareness of something

00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:27.512
beyond human comprehension,

00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:34.087
can only be called a terrible awe.

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:37.301
This might be somewhat difficult to grasp

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:39.839
now that we use the word "awesome"

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:44.018
to describe a new app or a viral video.

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:47.223
With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:49.871
we're protected from real awe.

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.759
We close the doors and hunker down,

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.305
convinced that we're in control,

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:57.327
or, at least, hoping for control.

00:04:57.327 --> 00:04:59.235
We do our best to ignore the fact that

00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:01.296
we don't always have it,

00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:04.053
and that not everything can be explained.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:08.215
Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,

00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:10.910
whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.174
came from inside himself or from outside,

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:19.878
what's clear is that he did experience them,

00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:22.314
and that he did so with a force that would shatter

00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:24.635
his sense of himself and his world

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:27.775
and transform this otherwise modest man

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:34.468
into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:39.710
Fear was the only sane response,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.734
the only human response.

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:47.242
Too human for some,

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:49.975
like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.842
the account of his wanting to kill himself

00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:54.280
shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.734
that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:01.525
They insist that he never doubted

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:08.135
for even a single moment, let alone despaired.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:11.972
Demanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:16.691
human imperfection.

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:23.886
Yet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:26.860
As I read those early accounts, I realized it was

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.670
precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.067
that allowed me to begin to see him in full,

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:36.653
to accord him the integrity of reality.

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:38.822
And the more I thought about it,

00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:41.839
the more it made sense that he doubted,

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:48.422
because doubt is essential to faith.

00:06:48.422 --> 00:06:51.302
If this seems a startling idea at first,

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:54.963
consider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:58.798
is the heart of the matter.

00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:03.203
Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,

00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:08.446
but absolute, heartless conviction.

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:12.317
You're certain that you possess the Truth --

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:16.608
inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T --

00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:19.166
and this certainty quickly devolves

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:22.678
into dogmatism and righteousness,

00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:26.781
by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride

00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.569
in being so very right,

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:38.457
in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:42.933
It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:45.991
that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists

00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:49.182
is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists

00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:51.994
known as Crusaders:

00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:57.219
"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless."

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:01.558
Doubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:06.023
is in fact the opposite of faith.

00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:11.982
In effect, they are the infidels.

00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:14.809
Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes,

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:18.654
they have no questions, only answers.

00:08:18.654 --> 00:08:21.446
They found the perfect antidote to thought

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:25.217
and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.

00:08:25.217 --> 00:08:27.166
They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.216
wrestling through the night with the angel,

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:32.374
or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,

00:08:32.374 --> 00:08:35.576
or like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,

00:08:35.576 --> 00:08:38.070
but throughout his years as a prophet,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.254
with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:45.542
and condemning those who most loudly proclaim

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:49.339
that they know everything there is to know

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:56.233
and that they and they alone are right.

00:08:56.233 --> 00:09:03.646
And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,

00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:09.415
have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:11.908
We've allowed Judaism to be claimed

00:09:11.908 --> 00:09:15.779
by violently messianic West Bank settlers,

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:18.726
Christianity by homophobic hypocrites

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:21.246
and misogynistic bigots,

00:09:21.246 --> 00:09:26.205
Islam by suicide bombers.

00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:28.976
And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that

00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:31.168
no matter whether they claim to be Christians,

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:32.783
Jews or Muslims,

00:09:32.783 --> 00:09:38.438
militant extremists are none of the above.

00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:44.052
They're a cult all their own, blood brothers

00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:49.546
steeped in other people's blood.

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:51.748
This isn't faith.

00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:56.910
It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.932
We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.

00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:06.010
It's difficult and stubborn.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.248
It involves an ongoing struggle,

00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:11.302
a continual questioning of what we think we know,

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:13.867
a wrestling with issues and ideas.

00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:17.167
It goes hand in hand with doubt,

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:20.244
in a never-ending conversation with it,

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:26.639
and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:31.687
And this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,

00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:35.828
can still have faith.

00:10:35.828 --> 00:10:38.816
I have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East

00:10:38.816 --> 00:10:43.126
is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:46.287
to the contrary.

00:10:46.287 --> 00:10:48.659
I'm not convinced of this.

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:50.783
I can hardly say I believe it.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.725
I can only have faith in it,

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:56.743
commit myself, that is, to the idea of it,

00:10:56.743 --> 00:10:59.744
and I do this precisely because of the temptation

00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:01.744
to throw up my hands in resignation

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.265
and retreat into silence.

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:09.946
Because despair is self-fulfilling.

00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:12.266
If we call something impossible,

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:16.034
we act in such a way that we make it so.

00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:21.967
And I, for one, refuse to live that way.

00:11:21.967 --> 00:11:24.266
In fact, most of us do,

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:27.842
whether we're atheist or theist

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:31.782
or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,

00:11:31.782 --> 00:11:36.098
what drives us is that, despite our doubts

00:11:36.098 --> 00:11:38.426
and even because of our doubts,

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:42.898
we reject the nihilism of despair.

00:11:42.898 --> 00:11:46.131
We insist on faith in the future

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:50.869
and in each other.

00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:54.370
Call this naive if you like.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.467
Call it impossibly idealistic if you must.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.895
But one thing is sure:

00:11:59.895 --> 00:12:03.361
Call it human.

00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:06.396
Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world

00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:09.248
without such faith, without the refusal

00:12:09.248 --> 00:12:13.964
to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?

00:12:13.964 --> 00:12:17.230
I think not.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.273
After keeping company with him as a writer

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:22.573
for the past five years, I can't see

00:12:22.573 --> 00:12:27.676
that he'd be anything but utterly outraged

00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:30.823
at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:36.292
and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:40.582
He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population

00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:43.580
because of their gender.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:51.561
He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.

00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:54.267
He'd call out terrorism for what it is,

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:59.011
not only criminal but an obscene travesty

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:03.916
of everything he believed in and struggled for.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:09.185
He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life

00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:12.386
takes the life of all humanity.

00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:19.582
Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:22.652
And he'd commit himself fully

00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:29.672
to the hard and thorny process of making peace.

00:13:29.672 --> 00:13:31.107
Thank you.

00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:35.506
(Applause)

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:39.506
Thank you. (Applause)
