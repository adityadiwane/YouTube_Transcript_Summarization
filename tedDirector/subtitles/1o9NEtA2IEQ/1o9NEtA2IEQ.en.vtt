00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.060
All right, let's get up
our picture of the earth.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.796
The earth is pretty awesome.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.249
I'm a geologist, so I get
pretty psyched about this,

00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:21.636
but the earth is great.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.116
It's powerful, it's dynamic,
it's constantly changing.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.940
It's a pretty exciting place to live.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.796
But I want to share with you guys today
my perspective as a geologist

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.036
in how understanding earth's past

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.556
can help inform and guide
decisions that we make today

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.660
about how to sustainably live
on earth's surface.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.076
So there's a lot of exciting things
that go on on the surface of the earth.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.660
If we zoom in here a little bit,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.836
I want to talk to you guys a little bit
about one of the things that happens.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.606
Material get shuffled around
earth's surface all the time,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.856
and one of the big thing that happens
is material from high mountains

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.356
gets eroded and transported
and deposited in the sea.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.336
And this process is ongoing all the time,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.756
and it has huge effects
on how the landscape works.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.676
So this example here in south India --

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.196
we have some of the biggest
mountains in the world,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.196
and you can see in this satellite photo

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.396
rivers transporting material
from those mountains out to the sea.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.595
You can think of these rivers
like bulldozers.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.340
They're basically taking these mountains
and pushing them down towards the sea.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.076
We'll give you guys an example here.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.436
So we zoom in a little bit.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.996
I want to talk to you guys
specifically about a river.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.676
We can see these beautiful patterns
that the rivers make

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.796
as they're pushing material
down to the sea,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.436
but these patterns aren't static.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.146
These rivers are wiggling
and jumping around quite a bit,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.136
and it can have big impacts on our lives.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.556
So an example of this
is this is the Kosi River.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.236
So the Kosi River
has this nice c-shaped pathway,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.716
and it exits the big mountains of Nepal

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.876
carrying with it a ton of material,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.866
a lot of sediments that's being
eroded from the high mountains,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.746
and it spreads out across India

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.090
and moves this material.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.676
So we're going to zoom in to this area

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.129
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
about what happened with the Kosi.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.716
It's an example of how dynamic
these systems can be.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.316
So this is a satellite image
from August of 2008,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.036
and this satellite image is colored

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.236
so that vegetations or plants
show up as green

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.916
and water shows up as blue.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.476
So here again you can see
that c-shaped pathway

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.420
that this river takes as it exits Nepal.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.956
And now this is monsoon season.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.476
August is monsoon season
in this region of the world,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.396
and anyone that lives near a river
is no stranger to flooding

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.992
and the hazards and inconveniences
at minimum that are associated with that.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.516
But something interesting
happened in 2008,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.436
and this river moved in a way
that's very different.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.460
It flooded in a way that's very
different than it normally does.

00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.236
So the Kosi River is flowing down here,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.836
but sometimes as these rivers
are bulldozing sediment,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.116
they kind of get clogged,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.276
and these clogs can
actually cause the rivers

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.996
to shift their course dramatically.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.876
So this satellite image
is from just two weeks later.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.836
Here's the previous pathway,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.476
that c-shaped pathway,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.596
and you notice it's not blue anymore.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.596
But now what we have is this blue pathway

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.076
that cuts down the middle
of the field of view here.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.436
What happened is
the Kosi River jumped its banks,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.156
and for reference,
the scale bar here is 40 miles.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.700
This river moved
over 30 miles very abruptly.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.556
So this river got clogged
and it jumped its banks.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.676
Here's an image from about a week later,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.956
and you can see
these are the previous pathways,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.636
and you can see this process
of river-jumping continues

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.232
as this river moves farther away
from its major course.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.796
So you can imagine
in landscapes like this,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.436
where rivers move around frequently,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.956
it's really important to understand when,
where and how they're going to jump.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.860
But these kinds of processes
also happen a lot closer to home as well.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.276
So in the United States,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.356
we have the Mississippi River
that drains most of the continental US.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.756
It pushes material
from the Rocky Mountains

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.316
and from the Great Plains.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.556
It drains it and moves it
all the way across America

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.500
and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.596
So this is the course of the Mississippi
that we're familiar with today,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.716
but it didn't always flow
in this direction.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.396
If we use the geologic record,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.140
we can reconstruct
where it went in the past.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.236
So for example, this red area here

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.796
is where we know the Mississippi River
flowed and deposited material

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.460
about 4,600 years ago.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.156
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.556
to follow the course
outlined here in orange.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.596
And it kept moving and it keeps moving.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.516
So here's about 2,000 years ago,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.236
a thousand years ago,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.476
700 years ago.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.916
And it was only
as recently as 500 years ago

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.779
that it occupied the pathway
that we're familiar with today.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.836
So these processes are really important,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.716
and especially here, this delta area,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.556
where these river-jumping events
in the Mississippi

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.396
are building land at the interface
of the land and the sea.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.156
This is really valuable real estate,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.436
and deltas like this are some of the most
densely populated areas on our planet.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.916
So understanding the dynamics
of these landscapes,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.076
how they formed and how they will
continue to change in the future

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.500
is really important
for the people that live there.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.836
So rivers also wiggle.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.756
These are sort of bigger jumps
that we've been talking about.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.036
I want to show you guys
some river wiggles here.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.596
So we're going to fly down
to the Amazon River basin,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.636
and here again we have a big river system

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.036
that is draining and moving and plowing
material from the Andean Mountains,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.876
transporting it across South America

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.580
and dumping it out
into the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.076
So if we zoom in here, you guys
can see these nice, curvy river pathways.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.076
Again, they're really beautiful,
but again, they're not static.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.836
These rivers wiggle around.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.476
We can use satellite imagery
over the last 30 or so years

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.636
to actually monitor how these change.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.836
So take a minute and just watch
any bend or curve in this river,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.836
and you'll see it doesn't stay
in the same place for very long.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.140
It changes and evolves
and warps its pattern.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.036
If you look in this area in particular,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.036
I want you guys to notice
there's a sort of a loop in the river

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.476
that gets completely cut off.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.076
It's almost like a whip cracking

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.780
and snaps off the pathway
of the river at a certain spot.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.796
So just for reference, again,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.756
in this location, that river
changed its course over four miles

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.460
over the course of a season or two.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.796
So the landscapes
that we live in on earth,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.236
as this material
is being eroded from the mountains

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.596
and transported to the sea,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.236
are wiggling around all the time.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.716
They're changing all the time,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.196
and we need to be able
to understand these processes

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.956
so we can manage and live
sustainably on these landscapes.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.036
But it's hard to do
if the only information we have

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.396
is what's going on today
at earth's surface.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.476
Right? We don't have
a lot of observations.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.316
We only have 30 years' worth
of satellite photos, for example.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.236
We need more observations
to understand these processes more.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.876
And additionally, we need to know

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.116
how these landscapes are going
to respond to changing climate

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.396
and to changing land use

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.260
as we continue to occupy
and modify earth's surface.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.516
So this is where the rocks come in.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.036
So as rivers flow,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.956
as they're bulldozing material
from the mountains to the sea,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.436
sometimes bits of sand and clay
and rock get stuck in the ground.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.156
And that stuff that gets stuck
in the ground gets buried,

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.916
and through time, we get
big, thick accumulations of sediments

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.956
that eventually turn into rocks.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.556
What this means is that we can
go to places like this,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.276
where we see big, thick stacks
of sedimentary rocks,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.796
and go back in time

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.556
and see what the landscapes
looked like in the past.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.716
We can do this to help reconstruct

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.060
and understand
how earth landscapes evolve.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.596
This is pretty convenient, too,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.596
because the earth has had
sort of an epic history. Right?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.436
So this video here
is a reconstruction of paleogeography

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.076
for just the first
600 million years of earth's history.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.076
So just a little bit of time here.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.836
So as the plates move around,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.996
we know climate has changed,
sea level has changed,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.676
we have a lot of different
types of landscapes

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.436
and different types of environments
that we can go back --

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.836
if we have a time machine --

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.196
we can go back and look at,

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.956
and we do indeed have a time machine

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.316
because we can look at the rocks
that were deposited at these times.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.356
So I'm going to give you
an example of this

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.596
and take you to a special
time in earth's past.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.836
About 55 million years ago,
there was a really abrupt warming event,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.356
and what happened was
a whole bunch of carbon dioxide

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.196
was released into earth's atmosphere,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.076
and it caused a rapid
and pretty extreme global warming event.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.756
And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.756
that there were things
like crocodiles and palm trees

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.796
as far north as Canada
and as far south as Patagonia.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.996
So this was a pretty warm time
and it happened really abruptly.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.236
So what we can do

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.316
is we can go back and find rocks
that were deposited at this time

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.940
and reconstruct how the landscape changed
in response to this warming event.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.276
So here, yay, rocks.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.636
(Laughter)

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.396
Here's a pile of rocks.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.036
This yellow blob here,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.796
this is actually a fossil river,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.487
so just like this cartoon I showed,

00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.796
these are deposits that were
laid down 55 million years ago.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.916
As geologists, we can go
and look at these up close

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.369
and reconstruct the landscape.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.556
So here's another example.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.036
The yellow blob here is a fossil river.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.596
Here's another one above it.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.916
We can go and look in detail
and make measurements and observations,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.316
and we can measure features.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.716
For example, the features
I just highlighted there

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.196
tell us that this particular river
was probably about three feet deep.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.316
You could wade
across this cute little stream

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.580
if you were walking around
55 million years ago.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.196
The reddish stuff that's above
and below those channels,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.996
those are ancient soil deposits.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.876
So we can look at those to tell us
what lived and grew on the landscape

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.460
and to understand how these rivers
were interacting with their floodplains.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.876
So we can look in detail
and reconstruct with some specificity

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.756
how these rivers flowed
and what the landscapes looked like.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.260
So when we do this
for this particular place

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.196
at this time,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.956
if we look what happened
before this abrupt warming event,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.596
the rivers kind of carved their way
down from the mountains to the sea,

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.756
and they looked maybe similar to what
I showed you in the Amazon River basin.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.236
But right at the onset
of this climate change event,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.740
the rivers change dramatically.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.156
All of a sudden they got much broader,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.740
and they started to slide back and forth
across the landscape more readily.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.596
Eventually, the rivers reverted
back to a state that was more similar

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.436
to what they would have looked like
before this climate event,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.100
but it took a long, long time.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.916
So we can go back in earth's time
and do these kinds of reconstructions

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.556
and understand how
earth's landscape has changed

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.356
in response to a climate event like this
or a land use event.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.476
So some of the ways that rivers change

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.276
or the reasons that rivers change
their pattern and their movements

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.236
is because of things like with extra water
falling on the land's surface

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.196
when climate is hotter,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.756
we can move more sediment
and erode more sediment,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.620
and that changes how rivers behave.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.596
So ultimately,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.236
as long as earth's surface is our home,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.636
we need to carefully manage
the resources and risks

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.636
associated with living
in dynamic environments.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.596
And I think the only way
we can really do that sustainably

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.836
is if we include information

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.956
about how landscapes evolved
and behaved in earth's past.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.196
Thank you.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.660
