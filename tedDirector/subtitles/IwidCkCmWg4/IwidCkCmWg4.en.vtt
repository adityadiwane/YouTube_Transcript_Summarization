00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Please close your eyes,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and open your hands.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
an apple, maybe your wallet.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Now open your eyes.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
What about a life?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
What you see here is a premature baby.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
enough fat on his body to stay warm.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Sadly, 20 million babies like this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
are born every year around the world.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Four million of these babies die annually.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
its only job is to grow.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
resulting in a range of health problems

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
from diabetes, to heart disease,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
to low I.Q.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
if these babies were just kept warm.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
That is the primary function of an incubator.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
But traditional incubators require electricity

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
As a result, parents resort to local solutions

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and the doctor advised her to take Rani

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
But that hospital was over four hours away,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
so her baby died.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
something that could work without electricity,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We needed something that was portable,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and something ultra-low-cost,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
compared to the 20,000 dollars

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So, this is what we came up with.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
This is a phase-change material.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
You can melt this simply using hot water

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
for four to six hours at a time,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
after which you simply reheat the pouch.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and it creates a warm micro-environment

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
for the baby.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
less than 0.1 percent of the cost

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
of a traditional incubator.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
of almost a million babies.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
This seems counterintuitive,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
population sizes also decrease,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because parents don't need to anticipate

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
that their babies are going to die.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and other simple innovations like this

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
represent a new trend for the future of technology:

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
simple, localized, affordable solutions

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
We really tried to understand the end user,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
in this case, people like Sevitha.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
We tried to understand the root of the problem

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
rather than being biased by what already exists.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to address this problem.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
