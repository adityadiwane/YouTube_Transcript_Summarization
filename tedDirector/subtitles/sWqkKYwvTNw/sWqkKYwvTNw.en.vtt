00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.216
My name is Lovegrove.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.336
I only know nine Lovegroves,
two of which are my parents.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.176
They are first cousins, and you know
what happens when, you know --

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.416
(Laughter)

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.656
So there's a terribly weird
freaky side to me,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.536
which I'm fighting with all the time.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.336
So to try and get through today,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.416
I've kind of disciplined myself
with an 18-minute talk.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.936
I was hanging on to have a pee.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.296
I thought perhaps
if I was hanging on long enough,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.320
that would guide me
through the 18 minutes.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.656
(Laughter)

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.176
OK. I am known as Captain Organic

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.439
and that's a philosophical position
as well as an aesthetic position.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.816
But today what I'd like to talk
to you about is that love of form

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.800
and how form can touch
people's soul and emotion.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.616
Not very long ago,
not many thousands of years ago,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.576
we actually lived in caves,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.856
and I don't think
we've lost that coding system.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.016
We respond so well to form.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.496
But I'm interested
in creating intelligent form.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.456
I'm not interested at all in blobism

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.496
or any of that superficial rubbish
that you see coming out as design.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.160
This artificially induced
consumerism -- I think it's atrocious.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.216
My world is the world
of people like Amory Lovins,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.696
Janine Benyus, James Watson.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.336
I'm in that world,
but I work purely instinctively.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.096
I'm not a scientist.
I could have been, perhaps,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.936
but I work in this world
where I trust my instincts.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.616
So I am a 21st-century
translator of technology

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.776
into products that we use everyday
and relate beautifully and naturally with.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.536
And we should be developing things --
we should be developing packaging

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.416
for ideas which elevate
people's perceptions

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.936
and respect for the things
that we dig out of the earth

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.216
and translate into products
for everyday use.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.696
So, the water bottle.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.376
I'll begin with this concept
of what I call DNA.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.576
DNA: Design, Nature, Art.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.981
These are the three things
that condition my world.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:41.496
Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,
500 years ago, before photography.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.576
It shows how observation,
curiosity and instinct

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.816
work to create amazing art.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.616
Industrial design is the art form
of the 21st century.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.176
People like Leonardo --
there have not been many --

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.816
had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.336
I work from a similar position.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.503
I don't want to sound
pretentious saying that,

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:07.296
but this is my drawing made
on a digital pad a couple of years ago --

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.656
well into the 21st century,
500 years later.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.656
It's my impression of water.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.204
Impressionism being the most valuable
art form on the planet as we know it:

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.576
100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.456
I use, now, a whole new process.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.456
A few years ago I reinvented my process

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.016
to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,
Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.376
all these people that I think
are persevering and pioneering

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.416
with fantastic new ideas
of how to create form.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.936
This is all created digitally.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.216
Here you see the machining,
the milling of a block of acrylic.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.479
This is what I show to the client to say,
"That's what I want to do."

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:45.027
At that point, I don't know
if that's possible at all.

00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:49.508
It's a seductor, but I just feel
in my bones that that's possible.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.136
So we go, we look at the tooling.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.776
We look at how that is produced.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.753
These are the invisible things
that you never see in your life.

00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.336
This is the background noise
of industrial design.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.176
That is like an Anish Kapoor
flowing through a Richard Serra.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.439
It is more valuable
than the product in my eyes.

00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:07.845
I don't have one.

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.757
When I do make some money,
I'll have one machined for myself.

00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:12.034
This is the final product.

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:14.275
When they sent it to me,
I thought I'd failed.

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.656
It felt like nothing.
It has to feel like nothing.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.216
It was when I put the water in

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.896
that I realized that I'd put
a skin on water itself.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.936
It's an icon of water itself,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.776
and it elevates people's perception
of contemporary design.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.136
Each bottle is different,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.780
meaning the water level
will give you a different shape.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.816
It's mass individualism
from a single product.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.056
It fits the hand.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.416
It fits arthritic hands.
It fits children's hands.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.583
It makes the product strong,
the tessellation.

00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:41.896
It's a millefiori of ideas.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.656
In the future, they will look like that,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.307
because we need to move away
from those type of polymers

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.958
and use that for medical equipment

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:51.038
and more important things,
perhaps, in life.

00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:53.736
Biopolymers, these new
ideas for materials,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.176
will come into play in probably a decade.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.776
It doesn't look as cool, does it?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.856
But I can live up to that.
I don't have a problem with that.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.560
I design for that condition,
biopolymers. It's the future.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.176
I took this video in Cape Town last year.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.936
This is the freaky side coming out.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.496
I have this special interest
in things like this, which blow my mind.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.456
I don't know whether to,
you know, drop to my knees, cry;

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.736
I don't know what I think.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760
But I just know that nature --

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.096
nature improves with ever-greater purpose

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.056
that which once existed,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.216
and that strangeness
is a consequence of innovative thinking.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.496
When I look at these things,
they look pretty normal to me.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.901
But these things evolved over many years,
and what we're trying to do --

00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:43.096
I get three weeks to design a telephone.
How the hell do I do that,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.716
when you get these things that take
hundreds of millions of years to evolve?

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.136
How do you condense that?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.696
It comes back to instinct.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.656
I'm not talking about designing
telephones that look like that

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.300
and I'm not looking
at designing architecture like that.

00:05:55.324 --> 00:05:57.536
I'm just interested
in natural growth patterns

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.736
and the beautiful forms
that only nature really creates.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.536
How that flows through me
and how that comes out

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.176
is what I'm trying to understand.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.096
This is a scan through the human forearm.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.136
It's then blown up
through rapid prototyping

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.736
to reveal its cellular structure.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.256
I have these in my office.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.296
My office is a mixture
of the Natural History Museum

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.976
and a NASA space lab.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.816
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.936
This is one of my specimens.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.176
This is made --

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.976
bone is made from a mixture
of inorganic minerals and polymers.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.736
I studied cooking in school
for four years, and in that experience,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.475
which was called "domestic science,"

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:43.071
it was a bit of a cheap trick for me
to try and get a science qualification.

00:06:43.095 --> 00:06:44.656
(Laughter)

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.376
Actually, I put marijuana
in everything I cooked --

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.616
(Laughter)

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.260
And I had access to all
the best girls. It was fabulous.

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:53.665
All the guys in the rugby team
couldn't understand.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.256
Anyway -- this is a meringue.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.736
This is another sample I have.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.136
A meringue is made exactly the same way,
in my estimation, as a bone.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.816
It's made from
polysaccharides and proteins.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.016
If you pour water on that, it dissolves.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.696
Could we be manufacturing
from foodstuffs in the future?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.496
Not a bad idea. I don't know.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.282
I need to talk to Janine
and a few other people about that,

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:18.096
but I believe instinctively that
that meringue can become something,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.320
a car -- I don't know.

00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:22.176
I'm also interested in growth patterns:

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.696
the unbridled way that nature grows things

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.296
so you're not restricted by form at all.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.976
These interrelated forms,
they do inspire everything I do,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.456
although I might end up
making something incredibly simple.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.696
This is a detail of a chair
that I've designed in magnesium.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.776
It shows this interlocution of elements
and the beauty of, kind of, engineering

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.785
and biological thinking,

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:48.896
shown pretty much as a bone structure.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.736
Any one of those elements
you could sort of hang on the wall

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.416
as some kind of art object.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.216
It's the world's first chair
made in magnesium.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.296
It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.296
It's called "Go," by Bernhardt, USA.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.056
It went into Time magazine in 2001
as the new language of the 21st century.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.880
Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales
in a little village, that's enough.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.176
It shows how you make one holistic form,
like the car industry,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.915
and then you break up what you need.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.136
This is an absolutely
beautiful way of working.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.416
It's a godly way of working.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.696
It's organic and it's essential.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.387
It's an absolutely fat-free design,

00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:29.296
and when you look at it,
you see human beings.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.749
When that moves into polymers,

00:08:30.773 --> 00:08:35.136
you can change the elasticity,
the fluidity of the form.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.776
This is an idea for a gas-injected,
one-piece polymer chair.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.576
What nature does
is it drills holes in things.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.816
It liberates form.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.936
It takes away anything extraneous.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.176
That's what I do.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.616
I make organic things which are essential.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.736
And they look funky, too --
but I don't set out to make funky things

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.816
because I think
that's an absolute disgrace.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.936
I set out to look at natural forms.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.936
If you took the idea of fractal technology
further, take a membrane,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.655
shrinking it down constantly
like nature does --

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.256
that could be a seat for a chair.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.056
It could be a sole for a sports shoe.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.936
It could be a car blending into seats.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.616
Wow. Let's go for it.
That's the kind of stuff.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.456
This is what exists in nature.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.416
Observation now allows us
to bring that natural process

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.456
into the design process every day.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.696
That's what I do.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.776
This is a show
that's currently on in Tokyo.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.456
It's called "Superliquidity."
It's my sculptural investigation.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.136
It's like 21st-century Henry Moore.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.976
When you see a Henry Moore, still,
your hair stands up.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.216
There's some amazing spiritual connect.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.136
If he was a car designer,
phew, we'd all be driving one.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.336
In his day, he was
the highest taxpayer in Britain.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.736
That is the power of organic design.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.160
It contributes immensely to our --

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.256
sense of being,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.138
our sense of relationships with things,

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:57.336
our sensuality and,
you know, the sort of --

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.376
even the sort of socio-erotic side,
which is very important.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.896
This is my artwork.
This is all my process.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.936
These actually are sold as artwork.
They're very big prints.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.456
But this is how I get to that object.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.656
Ironically, that object was made
by the Killarney process,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.296
which is a brand-new process here
for the 21st century,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.336
and I can hear Greg Lynn
laughing his socks off as I say that.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.056
I'll tell you about that later.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.856
When I look into these data images,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.616
I see new things.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.216
It's self-inspired.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.096
Diatomic structures, radiolaria,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.549
the things that we couldn't see
but we can do now --

00:10:33.573 --> 00:10:34.909
these, again, are cored out.

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:38.336
They're made virtually from nothing.
They're made from silica.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.536
Why not structures from cars like that?

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.656
Coral, all these natural forces,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.856
take away what they don't need
and they deliver maximum beauty.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.136
We need to be in that realm.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.536
I want to do stuff like that.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.608
This is a new chair which should
come on the market in September.

00:10:56.632 --> 00:11:00.456
It's for a company called Moroso in Italy.
It's a gas-injected polymer chair.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.136
Those holes you see there
are very filtered-down,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.176
watered-down versions of the extremity
of the diatomic structures.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.724
It goes with the flow
of the polymer and you'll see --

00:11:09.748 --> 00:11:12.736
there's an image coming up
right now that shows the full thing.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.656
It's great to have companies in Italy
who support this way of dreaming.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.831
If you see the shadows
that come through that,

00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:21.577
they're actually probably
more important than the product,

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.038
but it's the minimum it takes.

00:11:23.062 --> 00:11:25.336
The coring out of the back
lets you breathe.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.313
It takes away any material you don't need

00:11:27.337 --> 00:11:29.617
and it actually garners flexure too.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.416
I was going to break into a dance then.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.376
This is some current work I'm doing.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.456
I'm looking at single-surface structures

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.176
and how they stretch and flow.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.680
It's based on furniture typologies,
but that's not the end motivation.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.640
It's made from aluminum ...

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.056
as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.296
It's grown in my mind,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.896
and then it's grown in terms
of the whole process that I go through.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.576
This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,
who build parts for Bentleys and so on.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.776
It's being built as we speak

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.776
and it will be on show in Phillips
next year in New York.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.656
I have a big show
with Phillips Auctioneers.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.656
When I see these animations,
oh Jesus, I'm blown away.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.696
This is what goes on
in my studio everyday.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.496
I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.854
Some guy's got that on a computer --
there's this like, oh my goodness.

00:12:21.878 --> 00:12:25.616
So I try to create this energy
of invention every day in my studio.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.656
This kind of effervescent --

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.256
fully charged sense of soup
that delivers ideas.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.256
Single-surface products.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.976
Furniture's a good one.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.816
How you grow legs out of a surface.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.460
I would love to build this one day

00:12:41.484 --> 00:12:44.456
and perhaps I'd like
to build it also out of flour, sugar,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.096
polymer, wood chips --
I don't know, human hair.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.816
I don't know. I'd love a go at that.
I don't know. If I just got some time.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.656
That's the weird side coming out again.
A lot of companies don't understand that.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.376
Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.797
They said, "Give us the dream.
What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"

00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:04.020
I said, "You don't copy Apple,
that's for sure.

00:13:04.044 --> 00:13:05.304
You get into biopolymers."

00:13:05.328 --> 00:13:06.963
They looked straight through me.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.736
What a waste. Anyway.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.976
(Laughter)

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.216
No, it's true. Fuck them.
You know, I mean --

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.576
(Laughter)

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.816
I'm delivering; they're not taking.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.376
I've had this image 20 years.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.016
I've had this image of a water droplet
for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.816
That is an image of a car for me.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.221
That's the car of the future.
It's a water droplet.

00:13:27.245 --> 00:13:29.816
I've been banging on about this
like I can't believe.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.056
Cars are all wrong.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.319
I'm going to show you
something a bit weird now.

00:13:33.343 --> 00:13:35.936
They laughed everywhere
over the world I showed this.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.016
The only place
that didn't laugh was Moscow.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.856
Cars are made from 30,000 components.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.536
How ridiculous is that?
Couldn't you make that from 300?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.696
It's got a vacuum-formed,
carbon-nylon pan.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.252
Everything's holistically integrated.
It opens and closes like a bread bin.

00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:54.759
There is no engine.
There's a solar panel on the back

00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:58.083
and there are batteries in the wheels;
they're fitted like Formula 1.

00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:00.917
You take them off your wall,
you plug them in. Off you go.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.656
A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.919
transparent, so you can see
the people in there.

00:14:05.943 --> 00:14:07.420
You drive different.

00:14:07.444 --> 00:14:09.616
You see that thing. You do. You do.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.336
And not anesthetized, separated from life.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.656
There's a hole at the front
and there's a reason for that.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.096
It's a city car.
You drive along. You get out.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.720
You drive on to a proboscis. You get out.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.176
It lifts you up.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.716
It presents the solar panel to the sun,
and at night, it's a street lamp.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.896
(Applause)

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.968
That's what happens if you get inspired
by the street lamp first,

00:14:34.992 --> 00:14:36.176
and do the car second.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.816
I can see these bubbles
with these hydrogen packages,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.616
floating around
on the ground, driven by AI.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.315
When I showed this in South Africa,

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:48.442
everybody afterwards was going,
"Hey, car on a stick. Like this."

00:14:48.466 --> 00:14:50.126
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.336
(Laughter)

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.976
If you put it next to
contemporary architecture,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.536
it feels totally natural to me.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.418
And that's what I do with my furniture.

00:14:57.442 --> 00:15:00.576
I'm not putting Charles Eames'
furniture in buildings anymore.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.193
I'm trying to build furniture
which fits architecture.

00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:05.224
I'm trying to build
transportation systems.

00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:07.542
I work on aircraft for Airbus,

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:08.856
I do all this sort of stuff

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.656
trying to force these natural,
inspired-by-nature dreams home.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.456
I'm going to finish on two things.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.976
This is the stereolithography
of a staircase.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.760
It's a little bit of a dedication
to James, James Watson.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.496
I built this thing for my studio.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.736
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.656
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.896
I built this.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.696
This is the data that goes with that.
Incredibly complex.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.536
Took about two years,
because I'm looking for fat-free design.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.160
Lean, efficient things. Healthy products.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.536
This is built by composites.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.176
It's a single element which rotates around
to create a holistic element,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.016
and this is a carbon-fiber handrail
which is only supported in two places.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.936
Modern materials
allow us to do modern things.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.576
This is a shot in the studio.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.136
This is how it looks
pretty much every day.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.936
You wouldn't want to have
a fear of heights coming down it.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.336
There is virtually no handrail.
It doesn't pass any standards.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.416
(Laughter)

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.656
Who cares?

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.096
(Laughter)

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.978
And it has an internal handrail
which gives it its strength.

00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:17.193
It's this holistic integration.
That's my studio. It's subterranean.

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:19.536
It's in Notting Hill,
next to all the crap --

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.256
the prostitutes and all that stuff.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.416
It's next to David Hockney's
original studio.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.115
It has a lighting system
that changes throughout the day.

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:29.004
My guys go out for lunch.
The door's open. They come back in,

00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:31.963
because it's normally raining
and they prefer to stay in.

00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:33.172
This is my studio.

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:35.416
Elephant skull
from Oxford University, 1988.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.060
I bought that last year.
They're very difficult to find.

00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:40.656
If anybody's got a whale skeleton
they want to sell me,

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.216
I'll put it in the studio.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.576
So I'm just going
to interject a little bit

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.336
with some of the things
that you'll see in the video.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.656
It's a homemade video, made it myself
at three o'clock in the morning

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.096
just to show you how my real world is.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.336
You never see that.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.503
You never see architects or designers
showing you their real world.

00:16:57.527 --> 00:16:58.816
This is called a "Plasnet."

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.696
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair
I'm doing in Italy.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.696
World's first bamboo bike
with folding handlebars.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.496
We should all be riding one of these.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.616
As China buys all these crappy cars,
we should be riding things like this.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.840
Counterbalance.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.576
Like I say, it's a cross

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.816
between Natural History Museum
and a NASA laboratory.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.016
It's full of prototypes and objects.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.710
It's self-inspirational, again.

00:17:22.734 --> 00:17:24.609
I mean, the rare times when I'm there,

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:26.216
I do enjoy it.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.096
And I get lots and lots of kids coming.

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:35.336
I'm a contaminator for all those children
of investment bankers -- wankers.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:36.576
Sorry.

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.536
(Laughter)

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.376
That's a solar seed.
It's a concept for new architecture.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.136
That thing on the top is the world's
first solar-powered garden lamp --

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.896
the first produced.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.096
Giles Revell should be
talking here today --

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:51.336
amazing photography
of things you can't see.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:55.360
The first sculptural model
I made for that thing in Tokyo.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.776
Lots of stuff.
There's a little leaf chair --

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800
that golden looking thing
is called "Leaf."

00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:03.376
It's made from Kevlar.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.536
On the wall is my book
called "Supernatural,"

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.418
which allows me to remember
what I've done, because I forget.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:11.016
There's an aerated brick
I did in Limoges last year,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.480
in Concepts for New Ceramics
in Architecture.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.976
Gernot Oberfell, working
at three o'clock in the morning --

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.400
and I don't pay overtime.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.976
Overtime is the passion of design,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.776
so join the club or don't.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.336
(Laughter)

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg --

00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:33.765
we're traveling like you can't --
we fit it all in.

00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:35.576
I don't know how we do it.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.856
Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden,
then I'm in Beijing on Friday.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.416
You work that one out.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.616
And when I see Ed's photographs,
I think, why the hell am I going to China?

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.856
It's true. It's true.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.016
Because there's a soul
in this whole thing.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.536
We need to have a new instinct
for the 21st century.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.856
We need to combine all this stuff.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.576
If all the people who were
talking over this period

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.816
worked on a car together,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.520
it would be a joy, absolute joy.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.880
So there's a new X-light system
I'm doing in Japan.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.696
There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa.
There's a Kifwebe mask.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.280
These are my sculptures.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.936
A copper jelly mold.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.696
(Laughter)

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.292
It sounds like some quiz show
or something, doesn't it?

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.640
So, it's going to end.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.280
Thank you, James,
for your great inspiration.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.616
Thank you very much.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.240
(Applause)
