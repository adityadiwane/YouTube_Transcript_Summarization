00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
These are spinneret glands

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
on the abdomen of a spider.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
with raw materials of dead flies and water.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
That's roughly 10,000 times the range

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
of man-made fire detectors.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
maybe even factor 1,000 savings

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
in resource and energy use.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I believe there are three really big changes

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
we need to bring about.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
polluting way of using resources

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
to a closed-loop model.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to a solar economy.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
And for all three of these, I believe,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and all of those have benefited

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And let's start with radical increases

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in resource efficiency.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
When we were working on the Eden Project,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
we had to create a very large greenhouse

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
in a site that was not only irregular,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
It was a hell of a challenge,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and it was actually examples from biology

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
that provided a lot of the clues.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So for instance,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that would work regardless of the final ground levels.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Studying pollen grains

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and radiolaria and carbon molecules

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
helped us devise the most efficient structural solution

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
using hexagons and pentagons.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
The next move was that we wanted

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to try and maximize the size of those hexagons.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And in nature there are lots of examples

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It's a high-strength polymer.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And what you do is you put it together in three layers,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And the great thing about this stuff

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
is you can make it in units

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
of roughly seven times the size of glass,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So that was a factor-100 saving.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
in which one breakthrough facilitated another.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
So with such large, lightweight pillows,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
we had much less steel.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And with less overall weight in the superstructure,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
there were big savings in the foundations.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And at the end of the project we worked out

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that the weight of that superstructure

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
of how ideas from biology

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
delivering the same function,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
but with a fraction of the resource input.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And actually there are loads of examples in nature

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that you could turn to for similar solutions.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
based on giant Amazon water lilies,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
using nature as a design tool.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
The way we tend to use resources

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
is we extract them,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Nature works very differently.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
becomes the nutrient for something else in that system.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And there are some examples of projects

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And one of my favorites

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
by Graham Wiles.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It was ending up in landfills.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And I'm just going to talk through this animation.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
They then shredded the cardboard

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
They put it into worm recomposting systems,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So it transformed a linear process

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
into a closed-loop model,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and it created more value in the process.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
turning waste streams into schemes that create value.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And just as natural systems

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
there's a real sense with this project

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
that the number of possibilities

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
just continue increasing.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And I know it's a quirky example,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
but I think the implications of this are quite radical,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
because it suggests that we could actually

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And particularly in cities --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and look at those as opportunities.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
the Mobius Project,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
where we're trying to bring together a number of activities,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
all within one building,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And the kind of elements I'm talking about

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Then we would have an anaerobic digester,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
turn that into heat for the greenhouse

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and electricity to feed back into the grid.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
We'd have a water treatment system

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and generating energy from the solids

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
using just plants and micro-organisms.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and worms from the compost

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and supplying fish back to the restaurant.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So you can see that we're bringing together

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
cycles of food, energy and water and waste

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
all within one building.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
which at the moment is a complete eyesore.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Some of you may recognize this.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And with just a little bit of planning,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
we could transform a space dominated by traffic

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
into one that provides open space for people,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
reconnects people with food

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So the final project I want to talk about

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It may come as a surprise to some of you

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
were actually forested a fairly short time ago.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
huge areas of North Africa

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
were covered in cedar and cypress forests.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
And during the evolution of life on the Earth,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
it was the colonization

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
of the land by plants

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
The converse is also true.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
The more vegetation we lose,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and lead to further desertification.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And this animation,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
shift quite a lot,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and that raises the question

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And if you look at some of the organisms

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that have evolved to live in deserts,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
The way it does this is it comes out at night,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
crawls to the top of a sand dune,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and because it's got a matte black shell,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is able to radiate heat out to the night sky

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
goes even further.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
there are lots of little bumps on that shell.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And the effect of this is that

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
as the droplets start to form on the bumps,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
they stay in tight, spherical beads,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
which means they're much more mobile

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
So amazing example of an adaptation

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
to a very resource-constrained environment --

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and in that sense, very relevant

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
over the next few years, next few decades.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and you trickle seawater over that

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and is cooled in the process.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
So inside it's cool and humid,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
which means the plants need less water to grow.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And then at the back of the greenhouse,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
was it was producing slightly more freshwater

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
than it needed for the plants inside.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So they just started spreading this on the land around,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and the combination of that and the elevated humidity

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
had quite a dramatic effect on the local area.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
This photograph was taken on completion day,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and just one year later, it looked like that.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
turning barren land back into biologically productive land --

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to achieve restorative design.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
So we were keen to scale this up

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And when you think about nature,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
often you think about it as being all about competition.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
But actually in mature ecosystems,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
you're just as likely to find examples

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
of symbiotic relationships.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
So an important biomimicry principle

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is to find ways of bringing technologies together

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
in symbiotic clusters.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And the technology that we settled on

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
is concentrated solar power,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
to create electricity.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
consider that we receive

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
as we use in energy from all forms --

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
10,000 times.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
So our energy problems are not intractable.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It's a challenge to our ingenuity.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
CSP produces a lot of waste heat.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and enhance the restorative benefits.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
it's possible to grow all sorts of crops

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
that would not grow in direct sunlight.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
So this is how this scheme would look.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
We'd have concentrated solar power plants

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
at intervals along the way.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?"

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And it turns out

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
that different things crystallize out at different stages.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
is calcium carbonate.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And that builds up on the evaporators --

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and that's what that image on the left is --

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
So after a while, we could take that out,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
use it as a lightweight building block.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And if you think about the carbon in that,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and then locked away in a building product.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
The next thing is sodium chloride.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
You can also compress that into a building block,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
as they did here.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
This is a hotel in Bolivia.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And then after that, there are all sorts

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
of compounds and elements that we can extract,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And there's just about every element of the periodic table

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
in seawater.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
like lithium for high-performance batteries.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
due to the discharge of waste brine

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
from desalination plants.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
We could evaporate it

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
to enhance the restorative benefits

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and capture the salts,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
for how we could create zero-carbon food,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
as well as reversing desertification in certain areas.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
radical increases in resource efficiency,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
closing loops and a solar economy.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
They're not just possible; they're critical.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
will provide a lot of the solutions.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
Far too much of the talk about the environment

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
uses very negative language.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And this is an important point.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
you don't sit around talking about carpentry.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
No, you need to set people's souls ablaze

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
with visions of exploring distant shores."

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and let's make progress with what could be

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Thank you.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
(Applause)
