00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So the Awesome story:

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
It begins about 40 years ago,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And they got here in the late 1960s.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and they settled into a new life.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
They saw their first dentist,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
they ate their first hamburger,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and they had their first kids.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
My sister and I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
grew up here,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
We had close family,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
good friends, a quiet street.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
We grew up taking for granted

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
when they grew up --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
things like power always on

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in our houses,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
things like schools across the street

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and hospitals down the road

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and popsicles in the backyard.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
We grew up, and we grew older.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I went to high school.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I graduated.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I found a girl, I settled down --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
(Laughter)

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
but life was pretty good.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Life was pretty good.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
2006 was a great year.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I got married,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
2007 was a great year.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I graduated from school,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
(Laughter)

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
So you can't actually see them,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
but it was breathtaking,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
believe me.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Laughter)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
not just me.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
First of all, the news was so heavy.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
it was about ice caps melting,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
wars going on around the world,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
earthquakes, hurricanes

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and then eventually did collapse,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and so many of us losing our homes,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
or our jobs,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
or our retirements,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
or our livelihoods.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
My marriage wasn't going well,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and we just were growing further and further apart.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
One day my wife came home from work

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to have a very honest conversation.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
until only a month later,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
had been battling mental illness for some time.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And for those of you

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
you know how challenging it can be.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
on a Sunday night.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Very sadly, he took his own life.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And it was a really heavy time.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And as these dark clouds were circling me,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and I was finding it really, really difficult

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
to think of anything good,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I said to myself that I really needed a way

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
to focus on the positive somehow.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So I came home from work one night,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and I logged onto the computer,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and I started up a tiny website

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
called 1000awesomethings.com.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
I was trying to remind myself

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
but we just don't talk about enough --

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
things like waiters and waitresses

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
who bring you free refills without asking,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
being the first table to get called up

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and you get to be first in line --

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Laughter)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And slowly over time,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I started putting myself in a better mood.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I mean, 50,000 blogs

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
are started a day,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And nobody read it except for my mom.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and go up by 100 percent

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
when she forwarded it to my dad.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
(Laughter)

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
And then I got excited

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
when it started getting tens of hits,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and then hundreds and then thousands

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and then millions.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And then I got a phone call,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I was like, that sounds totally fake.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
(Laughter)

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.260
(Applause)

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
(Laughter)

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and I ended up walking a red carpet

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And the surprise

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and just the amazement of that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
when, in my inbox,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
10 literary agents were waiting for me

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
to talk about putting this into a book.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Flash-forward to the next year

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:21.260
(Applause)

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
So let's talk about those three As.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Over the last few years,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
I haven't had that much time to really think.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
that helped me grow my website,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
but also grow myself?"

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
as three As.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
They are Attitude, Awareness

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and Authenticity.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So Attitude:

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Look, we're all going to get lumps,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and we're all going to get bumps.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
We will all have high highs

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and big days and proud moments

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
of smiles on graduation stages,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
father-daughter dances at weddings

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
but between those high highs,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
but your husband might leave you,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
your girlfriend could cheat,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
It's not a happy thought,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
or bad scenes.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Your mom could get cancer,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
your dad could get mean.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And there are times in life

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and when that bad news washes over you,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
I just really hope you feel

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
like you've always got two choices.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
One, you can swirl and twirl

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and gloom and doom forever,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
or two, you can grieve

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and then face the future

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
with newly sober eyes.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
no matter what pain hits you,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
choosing to move forward and move on

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and take baby steps into the future.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
The second "A" is Awareness.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I love hanging out with three year-olds.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
I love the way that they see the world,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
because they're seeing the world for the first time.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
at their first baseball game

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and the smell of the hotdogs.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
for Thanksgiving dinner.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
I love the way that they see the world,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
because they're seeing the world

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
for the first time.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Having a sense of awareness

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Because you all used to be three years old.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
They're in there.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And being aware is just about remembering

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
that you saw everything you've seen

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
for the first time once, too.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So there was a time when it was your first time ever

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and smelt the bakery air,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and said, "Found money."

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
The last "A" is Authenticity.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Let's go all the way back to 1932

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
grew up and grew into

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.260
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
He's number 76 in the picture.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
you did not want to go up against.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
They were tough football players doing what they love,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
which was crushing skulls

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and separating shoulders on the football field.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
But Rosey Grier also had

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
another passion.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
In his deeply authentic self,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
He loved knitting.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
That's what he said.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
he started joining clubs.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And he even put out a book

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
(Laughter)

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
(Applause)

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
It's a great cover.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
(Laughter)

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And so what I love about this story

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
is that Rosey Grier

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
is just such an authentic person,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and that's what authenticity is all about.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And I think when you're authentic,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
you end up following your heart,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
and you put yourself in places

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and situations and in conversations

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
that you love and that you enjoy.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
You meet people that you like talking to.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
You go places you've dreamt about.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And you end you end up following your heart

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and feeling very fulfilled.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
So those are the three A's.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
to my parents coming to Canada.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
I don't know what it would feel like

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
I don't know, because I never did it,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and appreciating the small wonders

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that you're starting to see in your new world.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
you'd have to be really true to yourself

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
for about 10 seconds right now,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and my parents are sitting in the front row.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:45.260
(Applause)

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
of his first day in Canada.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And it's a great story, because what happened was

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
(Laughter)

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
for all the new immigrants to Canada.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
and there was this huge spread.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
there was olives, those little white onions.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
and little cubes of cheese.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and salmon salad sandwiches.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.260
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
(Laughter)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
I was eating olives with pie.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
(Laughter)

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
(Laughter)

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
When I was five years old,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and he would stare in wonder

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
Is this A&amp;P?"

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And when we did, my dad would say,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
drove it all the way to the docks

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and then sailed it all the way

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
across the Atlantic Ocean

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and then put it in another truck

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
There are so many things to be happy about.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
We are the only species

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
on the only life-giving rock

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
capable of experiencing

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
so many of these things.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
interior design and horoscope signs.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
You can sleep in clean sheets.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
You can go to the movies and get good seats.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
We've got all that,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
And that's the sad part.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
The cashiers at your grocery store,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
the foreman at your plant,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
every teacher you've ever had,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
every politician in every country,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
every actor in every movie,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
every single person in your family, everyone you love,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
everyone in this room and you

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
will be dead in a hundred years.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Life is so great that we only get such a short time

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
to experience and enjoy

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
And that moment is right now,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and those moments are counting down,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.260
You will never be as young as you are right now.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
with a great attitude,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
choosing to move forward and move on

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
whenever life deals you a blow,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
embracing your inner three year-old

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
and being authentic to yourself,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
being you and being cool with that,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
then I think you'll live a life

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
that is rich and is satisfying,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Thank you.
