00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I have a daughter, Mulan.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
And when she was eight, last year,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
she was doing a report for school

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
or she had some homework about frogs.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And we were at this restaurant,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and she said, "So, basically,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
frogs lay eggs

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and tadpoles turn into frogs."

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and then the males fertilize them.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And I said, "Yeah."

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
you know, that you need

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
to create a new frog

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter)

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?"

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And I thought, "Okay, here we go."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and all I could remember was,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
"Only answer the question they're asking.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Don't give any more information." (Laughter)

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
So I said, "Yes."

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And she said, "And where do, um,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
where do human women,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
like, where do women lay their eggs?"

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And I said, "Well,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
funny you should ask. (Laughter)

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
We have evolved to have our own pond.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And we lay our eggs there,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And I said, "Well,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Men, through their penis,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And you go through the woman's vagina."

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and she goes, "Mom!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Like, where you go to the bathroom?"

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And I said, "I know.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I know."

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.260
(Laughter)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
right next to an amusement park ...

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Bad zoning, but ..." (Laughter)

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
She's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
So how could that ever happen?"

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
"Human males and females

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
develop a special bond,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and when they're much older, much, much older than you,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and they have a very special feeling,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
then they can be naked together."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And she said, "Mom,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
have you done this before?"

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again."

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And I said, "..."

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Like, how do they know that's the time?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Mom, does the man just say,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
(Laughter)

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And I said, "Yes."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
(Laughter)

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
"That is exactly right.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
That's exactly how it happens."

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Oh ..."

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Would that ever happen?"

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And I said, "Oh, no, no.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
That's not how we do it."

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
"Mom, how do cats do it?"

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I don't understand the legs."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And I go, "I know, but the legs ..."

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And we watched them and I'm so thankful,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
She goes, "What about dogs?"

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So we put in dogs mating, and,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And then she goes, "Mom,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
do you think they would have, on the Internet,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
any humans mating?"

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
(Laughter)

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And then I realized that

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I had taken my little eight year old's hand,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And I looked into this

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
trusting, loving face,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and I said,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
"Oh, no.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
That would never happen."

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Thank you.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
(Applause)

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Thank you.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
(Applause)

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.
