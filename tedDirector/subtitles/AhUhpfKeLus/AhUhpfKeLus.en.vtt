00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:15.180
Silicon Valley
is obsessed with disruption,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.060
but these days, the biggest disruptor
didn't come out of Silicon Valley.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.300
It came out of steel towns in Ohio,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.380
rural communities in Pennsylvania,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300
the Panhandle in Florida.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.756
And this last US presidential election

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.400
was the mother of all disruptions.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.780
Once again, politics is personal.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.356
Millions of Americans
became activists overnight,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.196
pouring into the streets in record numbers

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.636
in record time.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.476
(Laughter)

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.836
The election has done
to family holiday dinners

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.620
what Uber has done
to New York City's taxi system.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.940
Couples have broken up
and marriages disrupted.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.076
And the election
is doing to my private life

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140
what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.020
These days, the ACLU
is on the front lines 24/7,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.860
and even if I manage to sneak away
for a couple of miles on the treadmill,

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:20.876
any cardio benefit I get
is instantly obliterated

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.340
when I read another presidential tweet
on the headline scroll.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.756
Even my secret pleasure

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.276
of studying the Italian painters

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.500
have been infected by politics.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.380
Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.676
This is my desk,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.516
with a postcard exhibition

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.396
of some famous and obscure paintings

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.420
mostly from the Italian Renaissance.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.556
Now, art used to provide me
with a necessary break

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.876
from the hurly-burly of politics

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.276
in my daily work at the ACLU,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.500
but not anymore.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.436
I was at the Women's March
in San Francisco

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.996
the day after inauguration,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.076
and the crowd was chanting,
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.260
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.356
And there I was holding my sign
and my umbrella in the rain,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.196
and I flashed on an old painting

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.340
that first captivated me many years ago.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.676
I struggled to remember
the different pieces

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.036
of an actual painting

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.260
of good and bad government.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.460
It was almost like the old master
was taunting me.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.180
You want to know
what democracy looks like?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.540
Go back and look at my frescoes.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.980
And so I did.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.756
In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti
finished a monumental commission

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.020
in the governing council chamber
of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.820
It's a painting that speaks to us,
even screams to us, today.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.076
"Art is a lie that makes us
realize truth,"

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.780
Pablo Picasso once said.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.756
And as we search for the truth
about government,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.676
we should keep Ambrogio's work,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.980
not a lie but an allegory,
in our collective mind's eye.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.796
During Lorenzetti's time,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.116
the political legitimacy
of Italian city-states

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.060
was often on very shaky ground.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.476
Siena was a republic,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.156
but there had been enormous unrest

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.420
in the two decades
leading up to the commission.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.356
Siena's political leaders,
who would literally govern

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.556
under the eyes
of these allegorical figures,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.820
were Lorenzetti's intended audience.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.756
He was cataloging the obligations

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.620
of the governing to the governed.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.236
Now, you can spend years
studying these frescoes.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.660
Some scholars have.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.316
I'm hardly an art historian,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.916
but I am passionate about art,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.516
and a work this massive can overwhelm me.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.980
So first, I focus on the big stuff.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.540
This is the allegory of good government.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.796
The majestic figure here in the middle

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.236
is dressed in Siena's colors

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.020
and he personifies the republic itself.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.076
Lorenzetti labels him "Commune,"

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.756
and he's basically telling the Sienese

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.860
that they, and not a king or a tyrant,
must rule themselves.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.700
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.260
Justice is enthroned.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.836
She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.180
who actually supports
her scales of justice.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.356
Concord, or Harmony,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.516
holds a string that comes
off the scales of justice

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.556
that binds her to the citizens,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.380
making them all
compatriots in the republic.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.676
And finally we see Peace.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.156
She looks chilled out,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.556
like she's listening to Bob Marley.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.556
When good government rules,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.460
Peace doesn't break a sweat.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.476
Now, these are big images and big ideas,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.700
but I really love the small stuff.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.716
Along another wall,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.076
Lorenzetti illustrates
the effects of good government

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.476
on the real and everyday lives
of ordinary people

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.380
with a series of delicious little details.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.940
In the countryside,
the hills are landscaped and farmed.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.796
Crops are being sown,
hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.220
all in one picture.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.540
Crops and livestock
are being brought to market.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.620
In the city, builders raise a tower.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.036
People attend a law lecture,
a TED Talk of the 14th century.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.620
(Laughter)

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.740
Schoolchildren play.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.580
Tradesmen thrive.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.780
Dancers larger than life dance with joy.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.740
And watching over the republic
is the winged figure Security,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.836
whose banner reads,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.540
"Everyone shall go forth
freely without fear."

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.756
Now, what's amazing
about these images from 800 years ago

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.700
is that they're familiar to us today.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.676
We see what democracy looks like.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.116
We experience the effects
of good government in our lives,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.100
just as Lorenzetti did in his life.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.716
But it is the allegory of bad government

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.100
that has been haunting me
since November 9.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.596
It's badly damaged,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.500
but it reads like today's newspapers.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.276
And ruling over bad government
is not the Commune

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.500
but the Tyrant.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.596
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.156
braided hair.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.596
He obviously spends
a lot of time on that hair.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.756
(Laughter)

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.076
Justice now lies helpless at his feet,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.396
shackled.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.220
Her scales have been severed.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.916
Justice is the key antagonist
to the Tyrant,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.620
and she's been taken out.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.836
Now, surrounding the Tyrant,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.140
Lorenzetti illustrates
the vices that animate bad government.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.796
Avarice is the old woman
clutching the strongbox

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.516
and a fisherman's hook

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.340
to pull in her fortune.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.916
Vainglory carries a mirror,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.996
and Lorenzetti warns us
against narcissistic leaders

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.860
who are guided
by their own ego and vanity.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.940
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.516
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.276
lulls us into a false sense of security

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.100
and then poisons a republic.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.020
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.140
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.660
She's dressed in Siena's colors.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.516
"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.660
She uses a carpenter's saw
to chop her body in half.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.036
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.180
the stone and knife.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.516
In the remainder of the fresco,
Lorenzetti shows us

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.500
the inevitable effects of bad government.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.516
The civic ideals celebrated
elsewhere in this room have failed us,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.076
and we see it.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.836
The once beautiful city
has fallen to pieces,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.676
the countryside barren,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.236
the farms abandoned.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.780
Many are in flames.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.756
And in the sky above
is not the winged figure Security,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.436
but that of Fear, whose banner reads:

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.475
"None shall pass along this road

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.780
without fear of death."

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.516
Now, the final image,
the most important one, really,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.356
is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.636
It is of the viewer.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.436
Today, the audience
for Lorenzetti's frescoes

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.916
is not the governing but the governed,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.756
the individual who stands
in front of his allegories

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.276
and walks away with insight,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.460
who heeds a call to action.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.036
Lorenzetti warns us
that we must recognize the shadows

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.956
of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.676
when they float
across our political landscape,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.516
especially when those shadows are cast

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.196
by political leaders loudly claiming
to be the voice of good government

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.380
and promising to make America great again.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.900
And we must act.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.180
Democracy must not be a spectator sport.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.116
The right to protest,
the right to assemble freely,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.036
the right to petition one's government,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.876
these are not just rights.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.396
In the face of Avarice,
Fraud and Division,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.260
these are obligations.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.076
We have to disrupt --

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.860
(Applause)

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.716
We have to disrupt our lives

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.396
so that we can disrupt

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.156
the amoral accretion of power

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.220
by those who would betray our values.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.756
We and we the people

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.636
must raise justice up

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.596
and must bring peace to our nation

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.796
and must come together in concord,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.540
and we have a choice.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.156
We could either paint ourselves

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.260
into the worst nightmare
of Lorenzetti's bad government,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.780
or we can stay in the streets,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.900
disruptive, messy, loud.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.940
That is what democracy looks like.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.076
Thank you.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.300
(Applause)

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.156
Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.596
Obviously, many people passionately --

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.636
you spoke to many people
passionately here.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.396
I'm sure there are other people here

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.116
who'd say, look, Trump was elected
by 63 million people.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.476
He's far from perfect,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.476
but he's trying to do
what he was elected to do.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.060
Shouldn't you give him a chance?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.636
Anthony Romero:
I think we have to recognize

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.436
the legitimacy of him as president

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.356
versus the legitimacy of his policies.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:24.156
And when so many of the policies
are contrary to fundamental values,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.116
that we're all equal under the law,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.716
that we're not judged by the color
of our skin or the religion we worship,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.476
we have to contest those values

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.756
even as we recognize and honor the fact

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.260
that our democracy rendered us a president
who is championing those values.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.036
CA: And the ACLU isn't just
this force on the left, right?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.476
You're making other arguments as well.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.116
AR: Well, you know,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.276
very often we piss
everyone off at one point.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.796
That's what we do.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.236
And we recently were taking stands

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.596
for why Ann Coulter needs
to be able to speak at Berkeley,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.036
and why Milo has free speech rights.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.636
And we even wrote a blog

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.316
that almost burnt the house down
among some of our members,

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.436
unfortunately,
when we talked about the fact

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.916
that even Donald Trump
has free speech rights as president,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.996
and an effort to hold him accountable

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.596
for incitement of violence
at his marches or his rallies

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.796
is unconstitutional and un-American.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.996
And when you put that statement out there

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.676
to a very frothy base

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.996
that always is very excited for you
to fight Donald Trump,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.516
and then you have a new one saying,
"Wait, these rights are for everybody,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.436
even the president that we don't like."

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.036
And that's our job.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.196
(Applause)

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.796
CA: Anthony, you spoke
to so many of us so powerfully.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.396
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.380
(Applause)
