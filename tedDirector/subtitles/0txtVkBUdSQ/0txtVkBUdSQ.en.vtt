00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:18.014
A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:21.746
Einstein published
his theory of general relativity,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.004
which is sort of a strange name,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:26.690
but it's a theory that explains gravity.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:31.713
It states that mass -- all matter,
the planets -- attracts mass,

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:36.351
not because of an instantaneous force,
as Newton claimed,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:40.338
but because all matter --
all of us, all the planets --

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:44.643
wrinkles the flexible fabric
of space-time.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:49.462
Space-time is this thing in which we live
and that connects us all.

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:54.801
It's like when we lie down on a mattress
and distort its contour.

00:00:55.938 --> 00:01:00.870
The masses move -- again,
not according to Newton's laws,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.801
but because they see
this space-time curvature

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:07.648
and follow the little curves,

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:11.236
just like when our bedmate
nestles up to us

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.572
because of the mattress curvature.

00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:15.596
(Laughter)

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:19.785
A year later, in 1916,

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:24.200
Einstein derived from his theory

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:28.037
that gravitational waves existed,

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:31.196
and that these waves were produced
when masses move,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.025
like, for example, when two stars
revolve around one another

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.009
and create folds in space-time
which carry energy from the system,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.500
and the stars move toward each other.

00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:47.079
However, he also estimated

00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:51.855
that these effects were so minute,

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.455
that it would never be possible
to measure them.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.629
I'm going to tell you the story of how,

00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:04.113
with the work of hundreds of scientists
working in many countries

00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:05.923
over the course of many decades,

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:09.556
just recently, in 2015,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.653
we discovered those gravitational
waves for the first time.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.066
It's a rather long story.

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:24.042
It started 1.3 billion years ago.

00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:27.550
A long, long time ago,

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:30.765
in a galaxy far, far away --

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.582
(Laughter)

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:38.225
two black holes were revolving
around one another --

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.137
"dancing the tango," I like to say.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.712
It started slowly,

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:45.838
but as they emitted gravitational waves,

00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:48.801
they grew closer together,
accelerating in speed,

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:52.424
until, when they were revolving
at almost the speed of light,

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:55.643
they fused into a single black hole

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:59.301
that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:03.827
but compressed
into the space of 360 kilometers.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.862
That's the size of the state of Louisiana,

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.146
where I live.

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:14.265
This incredible effect
produced gravitational waves

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:20.298
that carried the news of this cosmic hug
to the rest of the universe.

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:28.803
It took us a long time to figure out
the effects of these gravitational waves,

00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:35.566
because the way we measure them
is by looking for effects in distances.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.706
We want to measure longitudes, distances.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.863
When these gravitational waves
passed by Earth,

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.887
which was in 2015,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.791
they produced changes in all distances --

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:52.431
the distances between all of you,
the distances between you and me,

00:03:52.455 --> 00:03:53.651
our heights --

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:57.325
every one of us
stretched and shrank a tiny bit.

00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:02.227
The prediction is that the effect
is proportional to the distance.

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:04.694
But it's very small:

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:09.576
even for distances much greater
than my slight height,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.935
the effect is infinitesimal.

00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:17.941
For example, the distance
between the Earth and the Sun

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:22.413
changed by one atomic diameter.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.878
How can that be measured?

00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:26.953
How could we measure it?

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.929
Fifty years ago,

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:34.507
some visionary physicists
at Caltech and MIT --

00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:37.886
Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.956
thought they could precisely
measure distances

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.163
using lasers that measured
distances between mirrors

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.614
kilometers apart.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:54.498
It took many years, a lot of work
and many scientists

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:57.757
to develop the technology
and develop the ideas.

00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:00.088
And 20 years later,

00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:03.140
almost 30 years ago,

00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:09.177
they started to build two gravitational
wave detectors, two interferometers,

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.753
in the United States.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:14.990
Each one is four kilometers long;

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:19.612
one is in Livingston, Louisiana,

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.886
in the middle of a beautiful forest,

00:05:22.592 --> 00:05:26.420
and the other is in Hanford, Washington,

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:28.230
in the middle of the desert.

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:32.179
The interferometers have lasers

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:36.129
that travel from the center
through four kilometers in-vacuum,

00:05:36.153 --> 00:05:38.994
are reflected in mirrors
and then they return.

00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:41.662
We measure the difference in the distances

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.514
between this arm and this arm.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:48.747
These detectors are very,
very, very sensitive;

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:52.211
they're the most precise
instruments in the world.

00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:54.706
Why did we make two?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.329
It's because the signals
that we want to measure come from space,

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:02.818
but the mirrors are moving all the time,

00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:06.845
so in order to distinguish
the gravitational wave effects --

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:11.213
which are astrophysical effects
and should show up on the two detectors --

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:14.078
we can distinguish them
from the local effects,

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:17.182
which appear separately,
either on one or the other.

00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:22.075
In September of 2015,

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.068
we were finishing installing
the second-generation technology

00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:28.644
in the detectors,

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:33.708
and we still weren't at the optimal
sensitivity that we wanted --

00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:37.104
we're still not, even now,
two years later --

00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:39.655
but we wanted to gather data.

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:41.695
We didn't think we'd see anything,

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.345
but we were getting ready to start
collecting a few months' worth of data.

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:48.797
And then nature surprised us.

00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:53.737
On September 14, 2015,

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:56.823
we saw, in both detectors,

00:06:56.847 --> 00:06:59.026
a gravitational wave.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.522
In both detectors, we saw a signal

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.558
with cycles that increased
in amplitude and frequency

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:05.835
and then go back down.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:09.291
And they were the same in both detectors.

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.315
They were gravitational waves.

00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:17.225
And not only that --
in decoding this type of wave,

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:21.257
we were able to deduce
that they came from black holes

00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:23.274
fusing together to make one,

00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:26.312
more than a billion years ago.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.796
And that was --

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:35.379
(Applause)

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.339
that was fantastic.

00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:42.473
At first, we couldn't believe it.

00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:46.077
We didn't imagine
this would happen until much later;

00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:48.553
it was a surprise for all of us.

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:51.258
It took us months to convince
ourselves that it was true,

00:07:51.282 --> 00:07:54.469
because we didn't want to leave
any room for error.

00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:57.811
But it was true, and to clear up any doubt

00:07:57.835 --> 00:08:00.867
that the detectors
really could measure these things,

00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:02.785
in December of that same year,

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:05.689
we measured another gravitational wave,

00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:07.128
smaller than the first one.

00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:10.965
The first gravitational wave
produced a difference in the distance

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:13.613
of four-thousandths of a proton

00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:15.986
over four kilometers.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.504
Yes, the second detection was smaller,

00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:22.797
but still very convincing
by our standards.

00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:29.588
Despite the fact that these are space-time
waves and not sound waves,

00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:33.697
we like to put them into loudspeakers
and listen to them.

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:37.049
We call this "the music of the universe."

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:42.592
I'd like you to listen
to the first two notes of that music.

00:08:43.102 --> 00:08:45.362
(Chirping sound)

00:08:46.448 --> 00:08:48.576
(Chirping sound)

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.466
The second, shorter sound
was the last fraction of a second

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.284
of the two black holes which,

00:08:55.308 --> 00:09:00.238
in that fraction of a second,
emitted vast amounts of energy --

00:09:00.262 --> 00:09:06.913
so much energy, it was like three Suns
converting into energy,

00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:08.513
following that famous formula,

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:10.294
E = mc2.

00:09:10.318 --> 00:09:11.569
Remember that one?

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:18.007
We love this music so much
we actually dance to it.

00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.779
I'm going to have you listen again.

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:25.225
(Chirping sound)

00:09:26.558 --> 00:09:28.056
(Chirping sound)

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:31.303
It's the music of the universe!

00:09:31.327 --> 00:09:34.993
(Applause)

00:09:35.017 --> 00:09:38.139
People frequently ask me now:

00:09:38.163 --> 00:09:40.900
"What can gravitational waves
be used for?

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:45.510
And now that you've discovered them,
what else is there left to do?"

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.217
What can gravitational waves
be used for?

00:09:50.034 --> 00:09:54.352
When they asked Borges,
"What is the purpose of poetry?"

00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.217
he, in turn, answered,

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:57.937
"What's the purpose of dawn?

00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:59.961
What's the purpose of caresses?

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:01.985
What's the purpose
of the smell of coffee?"

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.424
He answered,

00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:10.253
"The purpose of poetry is pleasure;
it's for emotion, it's for living."

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:13.433
And understanding the universe,

00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:17.107
this human curiosity for knowing
how everything works,

00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:18.415
is similar.

00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:24.636
Since time immemorial, humanity --
all of us, everyone, as kids --

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.529
when we look up at the sky
for the first time and see the stars,

00:10:28.553 --> 00:10:29.716
we wonder,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.220
"What are stars?"

00:10:31.847 --> 00:10:34.571
That curiosity is what makes us human.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:38.292
And that's what we do with science.

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:45.616
We like to say that gravitational waves
now have a purpose,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.823
because we're opening up
a new way to explore the universe.

00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:53.618
Until now, we were able to see
the light of the stars

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.144
via electromagnetic waves.

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:01.744
Now we can listen
to the sound of the universe,

00:11:01.768 --> 00:11:05.763
even of things that don't emit light,
like gravitational waves.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.931
(Applause)

00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.107
Thank you.

00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:13.532
(Applause)

00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:15.556
But are they useful?

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:20.848
Can't we derive any technology
from gravitational waves?

00:11:21.507 --> 00:11:23.016
Yes, probably.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.628
But it will probably take a lot of time.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.316
We've developed
the technology to detect them,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.377
but in terms of the waves themselves,

00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:34.661
maybe we'll discover 100 years from now
that they are useful.

00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:38.739
But it takes a lot of time
to derive technology from science,

00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:40.349
and that's not why we do it.

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:42.648
All technology is derived from science,

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:45.775
but we practice science for the enjoyment.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.640
What's left to do?

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:50.827
A lot.

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.526
A lot; this is only the beginning.

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:57.707
As we make the detectors
more and more sensitive --

00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:59.648
and we have lots of work to do there --

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:01.917
not only are we going to see
more black holes

00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:06.245
and be able to catalog
how many there are, where they are

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:07.841
and how big they are,

00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:11.272
we'll also be able to see other objects.

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:16.889
We'll see neutron stars fuse
and turn into black holes.

00:12:16.913 --> 00:12:19.512
We'll see a black holes being born.

00:12:19.536 --> 00:12:22.674
We'll be able to see
rotating stars in our galaxy

00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:24.906
produce sinusoidal waves.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:30.768
We'll be able to see
explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:34.991
We'll be seeing
a whole spectrum of new sources.

00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:37.042
We like to say

00:12:37.637 --> 00:12:41.238
that we've added a new sense
to the human body:

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:42.960
now, in addition to seeing,

00:12:42.984 --> 00:12:45.077
we're able to hear.

00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:48.648
This is a revolution in astronomy,

00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:52.240
like when Galileo invented the telescope.

00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:56.309
It's like when they added sound
to silent movies.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.836
This is just the beginning.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.012
We like to think

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.767
that the road to science is very long --
very fun, but very long --

00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:16.154
and that we, this large,
international community of scientists,

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:18.738
working from many countries,
together as a team,

00:13:18.762 --> 00:13:21.445
are helping to build that road;

00:13:22.048 --> 00:13:25.838
that we're shedding light --
sometimes encountering detours --

00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.891
and building, perhaps,

00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:30.915
a highway to the universe.

00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:33.106
Thank you.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.055
(Applause)
