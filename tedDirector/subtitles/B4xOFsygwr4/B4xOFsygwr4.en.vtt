00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:15.770
Ah yes, those university days,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.673
a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:22.144
and world debating championships,

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:27.397
or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.389
Didn't get much sexier than the Spence

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:30.853
at university, let me tell you.

00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:35.239
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.570
from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.733
literally on the other side of the world.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.366
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.011
about Australians are true.

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:45.433
From the youngest of ages, we display

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.944
a prodigious sporting talent.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:52.289
On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.946
What you've heard is true.

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:56.770
Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.520
sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.707
This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.

00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:08.629
I'm almost five years old. Fair to say,

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:11.009
I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.889
But I stand before you today

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:16.335
not as a breakfast radio host,

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.241
not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,

00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:23.421
and always will be a mathematician.

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.615
And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug

00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:29.375
knows that it bites early and it bites deep.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.312
I cast my mind back when I was in second grade

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:34.335
at a beautiful little government-run school

00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:38.090
called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.151
and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:41.879
Ms. Russell, said to the class,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:44.344
"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:46.613
I've got no plans."

00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:49.760
It was an exercise in democratic schooling,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.382
and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:56.124
So some of the suggestions we made as to what

00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:58.688
we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.962
and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.107
and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:04.704
"That wouldn't work.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:08.695
That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.962
Now I wasn't trying to be smart.

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:11.797
I wasn't trying to be funny.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.012
I just politely raised my hand,

00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:15.995
and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.631
in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,

00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:22.194
"But Miss,

00:02:22.194 --> 00:02:25.990
surely if the diagonal of the square

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.201
is less than the diameter of the circle,

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:33.086
well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:36.104
(Laughter)

00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:40.375
"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.018
And there was that same awkward silence

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:43.216
from most of my classmates,

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:45.319
until sitting next to me, one of my friends,

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.771
one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.114
and punched me really hard in the head.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:51.198
(Laughter)

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:53.699
Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:58.248
you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.

00:02:58.248 --> 00:03:00.525
You can keep sitting here with us.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.195
Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:05.975
over there with them."

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:07.577
I thought about it for a nanosecond.

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:11.353
I took one look at the road map of life,

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:15.181
and I ran off down the street marked "Geek"

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:20.608
as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:24.336
I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:27.209
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.193
It's natural. It's everywhere.

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:32.498
Numbers are the musical notes

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:36.720
with which the symphony of the universe is written.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.003
The great Descartes said something quite similar.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.713
The universe "is written in the mathematical language."

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:45.937
And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:50.329
a number so beautiful, so massive,

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.902
I think it will blow your mind.

00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:55.649
Today we're going to talk about prime numbers.

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.615
Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:01.931
because it's 2 x 3.

00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.545
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7,

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.148
but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.131
or as we call them, factors.

00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:12.621
Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.

00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:14.632
One is not prime.

00:04:14.632 --> 00:04:17.172
The proof of that is a great party trick

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:20.076
that admittedly only works at certain parties.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:23.066
(Laughter)

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:26.728
Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.

00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:28.140
They keep going on forever.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.979
We know there are an infinite number of primes

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.929
due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:35.161
Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.

00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:36.858
But the third thing about prime numbers,

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:38.368
mathematicians have always wondered,

00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:40.630
well at any given moment in time,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.433
what is the biggest prime that we know about?

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:47.741
Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime.

00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.888
Don't freak out.

00:04:50.888 --> 00:04:53.889
All you need to know, of all the mathematics

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.374
you've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,

00:04:58.374 --> 00:05:00.107
never understood in the first place,

00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:02.492
all you need to know is this:

00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:06.739
When I say 2 ^ 5,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.586
I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:10.881
all multiplied together,

00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:14.097
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:17.501
So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,

00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.681
8, 16, 32.

00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:23.195
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.167
So 2 ^ 5,

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.879
those five little twos multiplied together.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.142
(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.

00:05:31.142 --> 00:05:34.453
31 is a prime number, and that five in the power

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:36.998
is also a prime number.

00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:40.502
And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:41.738
are of that form:

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:45.017
two to a prime number, take away one.

00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:47.434
I won't go into great detail as to why,

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:50.185
because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:54.396
but suffice to say, a number of that form

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.859
is fairly easy to test for primacy.

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:01.459
A random odd number is a lot harder to test.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:03.380
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.219
we realize it's not enough

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.960
just to put in any prime number in the power.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.557
(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:13.925
and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:16.051
(Laughter)

00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:19.291
But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:22.648
(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.517
After that point, they thin out a lot.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:27.647
And one of the things about the search for massive primes

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:30.786
that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:33.303
of all time have gone on this search.

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:36.040
This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.501
In the 1700s, other mathematicians said

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.533
he is simply the master of us all.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:44.721
He was so respected, they put him on European currency

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.366
back when that was a compliment.

00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:52.346
(Laughter)

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:55.429
Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:57.216
(2 ^ 31) - 1.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.564
It's over two billion.

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:01.599
He proved it was prime with nothing more

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.387
than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.

00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:06.341
You think that's big.

00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:09.618
We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1

00:07:09.618 --> 00:07:11.212
is a prime number.

00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:12.856
It's an absolute brute.

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:16.861
Look at it here: 39 digits long,

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:20.224
proven to be prime in 1876

00:07:20.224 --> 00:07:22.288
by a mathematician called Lucas.

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:24.224
Word up, L-Dog.

00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:25.969
(Laughter)

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.363
But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:29.560
it's not just finding the primes.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.811
Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.

00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:39.593
Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,

00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:42.269
21 digits long, was not prime.

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:44.698
But he didn't know what the factors were.

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.483
We knew it was like six, but we didn't know

00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:48.904
what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together

00:07:48.904 --> 00:07:50.154
to give us that massive number.

00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:52.195
We didn't know for almost 40 years

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.117
until Frank Nelson Cole came along.

00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:57.495
And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,

00:07:57.495 --> 00:08:01.291
he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,

00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.056
and started writing out the powers of two:

00:08:04.056 --> 00:08:07.177
two, four, eight, 16 --

00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:08.833
come on, join in with me, you know how it goes --

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:12.699
32, 64, 128, 256,

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:17.355
512, 1,024, 2,048.

00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:19.907
I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:22.677
Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there.

00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:24.340
He went on and on

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.009
and calculated 67 powers of two.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.501
He took away one and wrote that number on the board.

00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.842
A frisson of excitement went around the room.

00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:37.104
It got even more exciting when he then wrote down

00:08:37.104 --> 00:08:41.503
these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format --

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:45.416
and for the rest of the hour of his talk

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:50.049
Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.

00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:52.223
He had found the prime factors

00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:54.633
of (2 ^ 67) - 1.

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:57.135
The room went berserk --

00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.955
(Laughter) --

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.997
as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,

00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:04.344
having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:07.153
with no words.

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:09.840
He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.490
It took focus. It took dedication.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.490
It took him, by his estimate,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.461
"three years of Sundays."

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:20.799
But then in the field of mathematics,

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:23.914
as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,

00:09:23.914 --> 00:09:28.257
the age of the computer goes along and things explode.

00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:30.694
These are the largest prime numbers we knew

00:09:30.694 --> 00:09:34.101
decade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before

00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:37.301
as computers took over and our power to calculate

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:39.213
just grew and grew.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.295
This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.315
a very emotional year for me.

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:46.250
It was the year I left university.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.875
I was torn between mathematics and media.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.330
It was a tough decision. I loved university.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.203
My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.

00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:57.786
(Laughter)

00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:01.413
But I came to a realization about my own ability.

00:10:01.413 --> 00:10:04.930
Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.805
I'm a maths genius.

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:08.882
In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,

00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:12.611
I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.358
My skill is not in the mathematics.

00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:18.250
It is in telling the story of the mathematics.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.436
And during that time, since I've left university,

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:22.572
these numbers have got bigger and bigger,

00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:24.338
each one dwarfing the last,

00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:29.231
until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,

00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:32.590
who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.895
only to see it snatched away by a rival university.

00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:40.072
And then Curtis Cooper got it back.

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:45.399
Not years ago, not months ago, days ago.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.043
In an amazing moment of serendipity,

00:10:47.043 --> 00:10:51.195
I had to send TED a new slide

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:53.205
to show you what this guy had done.

00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:55.855
I still remember -- (Applause) --

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.358
I still remember when it happened.

00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:58.806
I was doing my breakfast radio show.

00:10:58.806 --> 00:11:00.178
I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:

00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:02.483
"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"

00:11:02.483 --> 00:11:03.897
I shivered --

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.637
(Laughter) --

00:11:05.637 --> 00:11:08.719
contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,

00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:11.170
and said "Girls, hold the front page.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.630
We're not talking politics today.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.587
We're not talking sport today.

00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:16.917
They found another megaprime."

00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:18.429
The girls just shook their heads,

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:20.666
put them in their hands, and let me go my own way.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.242
It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,

00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:25.571
currently the largest prime number we know,

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:33.581
is 2 ^ 57,885,161.

00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:36.384
Don't forget to subtract the one.

00:11:36.384 --> 00:11:43.608
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.

00:11:43.608 --> 00:11:47.034
If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,

00:11:47.034 --> 00:11:49.829
that's 22 meg.

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:51.873
For the slightly less geeky of you,

00:11:51.873 --> 00:11:54.010
think about the Harry Potter novels, okay?

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.360
This is the first Harry Potter novel.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.062
This is all seven Harry Potter novels,

00:11:58.062 --> 00:12:00.424
because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.

00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:03.943
(Laughter)

00:12:03.943 --> 00:12:06.255
Written out as a book, this number would run

00:12:06.255 --> 00:12:10.730
the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.269
Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.390
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.958
we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:29.328
it would have taken five hours to show you that number.

00:12:29.328 --> 00:12:32.294
I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.

00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.897
That's the way it goes.

00:12:34.897 --> 00:12:39.317
This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,

00:12:39.317 --> 00:12:43.440
and we know it is prime as confidently

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.814
as we know the number seven is prime.

00:12:46.814 --> 00:12:52.500
That fills me with almost sexual excitement.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.683
And who am I kidding when I say almost?

00:12:54.683 --> 00:12:57.245
(Laughter)

00:12:57.245 --> 00:12:58.896
I know what you're thinking:

00:12:58.896 --> 00:13:03.875
Adam, we're happy that you're happy,

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:06.373
but why should we care?

00:13:06.373 --> 00:13:09.083
Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.

00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:12.634
First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:15.713
"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,

00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:19.915
and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:22.236
is a remarkably simple question to ask.

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:25.249
It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:27.806
and just requires phenomenal grunt.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:29.975
Large prime numbers are a great way of testing

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.608
the speed and accuracy of computer chips.

00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:35.409
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:37.334
he wasn't the only guy searching.

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:38.519
My laptop at home was looking through

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.794
four potential candidate primes myself

00:13:40.794 --> 00:13:44.450
as part of a networked computer hunt around the world

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.705
for these large numbers.

00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:47.634
The discovery of that prime is similar to the work

00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:50.836
people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,

00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:53.908
in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:57.150
We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.669
are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia

00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:01.783
but on laptops, desktops,

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:03.649
in the palms of people's hands

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:07.062
who are simply helping out for the search.

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:09.391
But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.328
for the time in which we live,

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:16.172
when human minds and machines can conquer together.

00:14:16.172 --> 00:14:18.531
We've heard a lot about robots in this TED.

00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:20.141
We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.

00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:22.663
It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:26.558
an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.

00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:28.022
You think that's cool.

00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:30.588
Here's a machine doing something cool.

00:14:30.588 --> 00:14:32.774
This is the CubeStormer II.

00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:36.595
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.

00:14:36.595 --> 00:14:39.161
Using the power of the smartphone,

00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:46.354
it can examine the cube and solve the cube

00:14:46.354 --> 00:14:49.053
in five seconds.

00:14:49.053 --> 00:14:52.934
(Applause)

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:56.999
That scares some people. That excites me.

00:14:56.999 --> 00:15:00.230
How lucky are we to live in this age

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.523
when mind and machine can work together?

00:15:03.523 --> 00:15:05.795
I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:08.783
as a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.788
"What was your highlight of 2012?"

00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:12.250
People were expecting me to talk about

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.918
my beloved Sydney Swans football team.

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:17.926
In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,

00:15:17.926 --> 00:15:20.060
they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.051
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.

00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:25.165
It wasn't my highlight of 2012.

00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:27.128
People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.

00:15:27.128 --> 00:15:29.196
It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:31.251
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.

00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:33.415
It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.

00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:36.994
No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,

00:15:36.994 --> 00:15:40.626
was the discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:15:40.626 --> 00:15:43.302
Give it up for the fundamental particle

00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:46.307
that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.

00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:47.803
(Applause)

00:15:47.803 --> 00:15:50.616
And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.852
50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.262
considered one of the deepest of all questions:

00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:59.902
How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?

00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:04.361
I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?

00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:06.175
And he postulated a suggestion

00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:09.845
that there's this infinite, incredibly small field

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.963
stretching throughout the universe,

00:16:11.963 --> 00:16:14.048
and as other particles go through those particles

00:16:14.048 --> 00:16:16.440
and interact, that's where they get their mass.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.897
The rest of the scientific community said,

00:16:18.897 --> 00:16:20.506
"Great idea, Higgsy.

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:22.192
We've got no idea if we could ever prove it.

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:24.300
It's beyond our reach."

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.797
And within just 50 years,

00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:32.681
in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,

00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:36.313
we had designed the greatest machine ever

00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:39.379
to prove this incredible idea

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:43.342
that originated just in a human mind.

00:16:43.342 --> 00:16:45.874
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:47.960
We thought it might be there,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.380
and we went and found it.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.280
That is the essence of being human.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.954
That is what we are all about.

00:16:57.954 --> 00:16:59.923
Or as my friend Descartes might put it,

00:16:59.923 --> 00:17:01.636
we think,

00:17:01.636 --> 00:17:04.049
therefore we are.

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:05.440
Thank you.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.041
(Applause)
