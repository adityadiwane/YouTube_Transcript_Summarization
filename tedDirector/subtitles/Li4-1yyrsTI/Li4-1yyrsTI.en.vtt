00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.753
I want you to imagine

00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:16.708
what a breakthrough this was

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.136
for women who were victims of violence

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:21.092
in the 1980s.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:24.605
They would come into the emergency room

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.017
with what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,"

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:31.792
and I would see a woman who was beaten,

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:36.534
I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:38.295
and swollen eyes.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:42.333
And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.890
we would take her picture,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.042
we would wait 90 seconds,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.169
and we would give her the photograph.

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:52.063
And she would then have

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:55.290
the evidence she needed to go to court.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.724
We were making what was invisible visible.

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:01.695
I've been doing this for 30 years.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.858
I've been part of a social movement

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:05.821
that has been working on ending

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.928
violence against women and children.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:12.817
And for all those years,

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:17.549
I've had an absolutely passionate

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.496
and sometimes not popular belief

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:23.790
that this violence is not inevitable,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.795
that it is learned, and if it's learned,

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.860
it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.045
(Applause)

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.008
Why do I believe this?

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.221
Because it's true.

00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:44.458
It is absolutely true.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:50.014
Between 1993 and 2010,

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:53.347
domestic violence among adult women

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:54.699
in the United States

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:58.086
has gone down by 64 percent,

00:01:58.086 --> 00:02:00.763
and that is great news.

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:03.512
(Applause)

00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:06.615
Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:08.410
Our eyes were wide open.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.830
Thirty years ago, women were beaten,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.965
they were stalked, they were raped,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.506
and no one talked about it.

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:17.289
There was no justice.

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:21.913
And as an activist, that was not good enough.

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.384
And so step one on this journey

00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:26.381
is we organized,

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.015
and we created this extraordinary

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.007
underground network of amazing women

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:33.874
who opened shelters,

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.993
and if they didn't open a shelter,

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:37.585
they opened their home

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:40.619
so that women and children could be safe.

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.299
And you know what else we did?

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.764
We had bake sales, we had car washes,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.298
and we did everything we could do to fundraise,

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:50.275
and then at one point we said,

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.416
you know, it's time that we went

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.070
to the federal government

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.041
and asked them to pay for these

00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.056
extraordinary services that are saving people's lives.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:02.517
Right? (Applause)

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:05.591
And so, step number two,

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.936
we knew we needed to change the laws.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.223
And so we went to Washington,

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:15.093
and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.854
And I remember walking through the halls

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:20.264
of the U.S. Capitol,

00:03:20.264 --> 00:03:24.622
and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,

00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:26.728
and I couldn't imagine

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:28.855
that anybody would ever challenge

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:30.966
this important piece of legislation.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.902
I was probably 30 and naive.

00:03:33.902 --> 00:03:35.984
But I heard about a congressman

00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:38.301
who had a very, very different point of view.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.100
Do you know what he called

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.851
this important piece of legislation?

00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.338
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:48.517
The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:50.980
Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.056
in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.243
(Laughter)

00:03:57.243 --> 00:04:00.655
Ten years later, after lots of hard work,

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:03.732
we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:05.988
which is a life-changing act

00:04:05.988 --> 00:04:08.842
that has saved so many lives. (Applause)

00:04:08.842 --> 00:04:10.272
Thank you.

00:04:10.272 --> 00:04:13.163
I was proud to be part of that work,

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:15.613
and it changed the laws

00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:18.464
and it put millions of dollars into local communities.

00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:20.791
And you know what else it did? It collected data.

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.474
And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:26.056
In fact, I am a data nerd.

00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:28.084
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:29.429
I am a data nerd,

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.064
and the reason for that is I want to make sure

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:35.510
that if we spend a dollar, that the program works,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.974
and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:43.573
And I also want to say one other thing:

00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:45.788
We are not going to solve this problem

00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:48.641
by building more jails

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:50.938
or by even building more shelters.

00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:54.131
It is about economic empowerment for women,

00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.876
it is about healing kids who are hurt,

00:04:56.876 --> 00:05:00.336
and it is about prevention with a capital P.

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:04.730
And so, step number three on this journey:

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.682
We know, if we're going to
keep making this progress,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.983
we're going to have to turn up the volume,

00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:12.195
we're going to have to increase the visibility,

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.107
and we're going to have to engage the public.

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:18.517
And so knowing that, we went
to the Advertising Council,

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:20.838
and we asked them to help us

00:05:20.838 --> 00:05:23.428
build a public education campaign.

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:25.884
And we looked around the world to Canada

00:05:25.884 --> 00:05:28.526
and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.288
and we took this knowledge

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.781
and we built the first national

00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:34.872
public education campaign

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:37.442
called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:39.641
Take a look at one of our spots.

00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:41.502
(Video) Man: Where's dinner?

00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:45.014
Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so—

00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:48.058
Man: What is this? Pizza.
Woman: If you had just called me,
I would have known—

00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:51.231
Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza?
Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud.

00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:53.136
Please don't—Let go of me!

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:56.030
Man: Get in the kitchen!
Woman: No! Help!

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.385
Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:01.803
That's what hurts! That's what hurts!
(Breaking glass)

00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:04.044
Woman: Help me!

00:06:04.044 --> 00:06:07.463
["Children have to sit by and watch.
What's your excuse?"]

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:09.482
Esta Soler: As we were in the process

00:06:09.482 --> 00:06:11.144
of releasing this campaign,

00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:13.327
O.J. Simpson was arrested

00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:17.461
for the murder of his wife and her friend.

00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:19.564
We learned that he had a long history

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.937
of domestic violence.

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:23.463
The media became fixated.

00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:25.482
The story of domestic violence

00:06:25.482 --> 00:06:26.836
went from the back page,

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:29.642
but actually from the no-page, to the front page.

00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:32.596
Our ads blanketed the airwaves,

00:06:32.596 --> 00:06:34.946
and women, for the first time,

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:37.067
started to tell their stories.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:40.420
Movements are about moments,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.014
and we seized this moment.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:45.353
And let me just put this in context.

00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:48.489
Before 1980, do you have any idea

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:51.774
how many articles were in The New York Times

00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:54.787
on domestic violence?

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:58.451
I'll tell you: 158.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.962
And in the 2000s, over 7,000.

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:05.997
We were obviously making a difference.

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:08.743
But we were still missing a critical element.

00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:14.258
So, step four: We needed to engage men.

00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:16.201
We couldn't solve this problem

00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:19.318
with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.

00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:21.538
And I already told you I'm a data nerd.

00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:25.161
National polling told us that men felt indicted

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.660
and not invited into this conversation.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.376
So we wondered, how can we include men?

00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:33.495
How can we get men to talk about

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.239
violence against women and girls?

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:38.893
And a male friend of mine pulled me aside

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:42.269
and he said, "You want men to talk about violence

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:45.186
against women and girls. Men don't talk."

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:46.902
(Laughter)

00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:49.178
I apologize to the men in the audience.

00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:50.652
I know you do.

00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:52.706
But he said, "Do you know what they do do?

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.385
They do talk to their kids.

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:57.902
They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches."

00:07:57.902 --> 00:07:59.546
And that's what we did.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.320
We met men where they were at

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.859
and we built a program.

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:04.638
And then we had this one event

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:06.713
that stays in my heart forever

00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:09.298
where a basketball coach

00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:13.220
was talking to a room filled with male athletes

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.801
and men from all walks of life.

00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:17.704
And he was talking about the importance

00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:19.063
of coaching boys into men

00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:21.101
and changing the culture of the locker room

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.370
and giving men the tools to
have healthy relationships.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.298
And all of a sudden, he looked
at the back of the room,

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.010
and he saw his daughter,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.572
and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:33.431
and he said, "Michaela, come up here."

00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:35.638
And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,

00:08:35.638 --> 00:08:36.999
and she got up there,

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:39.605
and he said, "Sit down next to me."

00:08:39.605 --> 00:08:41.728
She sat right down next to him.

00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:44.536
He gave her this big hug, and he said,

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:47.788
"People ask me why I do this work.

00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:50.535
I do this work because I'm her dad,

00:08:50.535 --> 00:08:54.230
and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her."

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.582
And as a parent, I get it.

00:08:57.582 --> 00:08:59.738
I get it,

00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:02.621
knowing that there are so many sexual assaults

00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:04.489
on college campuses

00:09:04.489 --> 00:09:08.029
that are so widespread and so under-reported.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:10.134
We've done a lot for adult women.

00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:13.201
We've got to do a better job for our kids.

00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.391
We just do. We have to. (Applause)

00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:18.461
We've come a long way

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.472
since the days of the Polaroid.

00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:24.625
Technology has been our friend.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:28.684
The mobile phone is a global game changer

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:30.647
for the empowerment of women,

00:09:30.647 --> 00:09:34.852
and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube

00:09:34.852 --> 00:09:38.657
and all the social media helps us organize

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:42.108
and tell our story in a powerful way.

00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:44.606
And so those of you in this audience

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:46.447
who have helped build those applications

00:09:46.447 --> 00:09:48.808
and those platforms, as an organizer,

00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:51.218
I say, thank you very much.

00:09:51.218 --> 00:09:53.293
Really. I clap for you.

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.274
(Applause)

00:09:56.274 --> 00:09:59.021
I'm the daughter of a man

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.292
who joined one club in his life,

00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:04.966
the Optimist Club.

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:07.728
You can't make that one up.

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:11.278
And it is his spirit and his optimism

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.188
that is in my DNA.

00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:15.050
I have been doing this work

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.204
for over 30 years,

00:10:17.204 --> 00:10:19.901
and I am convinced, now more than ever,

00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:23.574
in the capacity of human beings to change.

00:10:23.574 --> 00:10:27.113
I believe we can bend the arc of human history

00:10:27.113 --> 00:10:30.131
toward compassion and equality,

00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:32.949
and I also fundamentally believe

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:34.987
and passionately believe

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:38.117
that this violence does not have to be part

00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:39.942
of the human condition.

00:10:39.942 --> 00:10:43.295
And I ask you, stand with us

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:47.110
as we create futures without violence

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.530
for women and girls and men and boys everywhere.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.692
Thank you very much.

00:10:53.692 --> 00:10:59.803
(Applause)
