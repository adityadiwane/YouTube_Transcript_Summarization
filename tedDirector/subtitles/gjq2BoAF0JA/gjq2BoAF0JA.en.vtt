00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:15.079
Can I get a show of hands --

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:18.805
how many of you in this room
have been on a plane in this past year?

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:21.411
That's pretty good.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.320
Well, it turns out that you
share that experience

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.179
with more than three billion
people every year.

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:30.340
And when we put so many people
in all these metal tubes

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.950
that fly all over the world,

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:34.647
sometimes, things like this can happen

00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:36.558
and you get a disease epidemic.

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:39.067
I first actually got into this topic

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:41.723
when I heard about the Ebola
outbreak last year.

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:43.207
And it turns out that,

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.061
although Ebola spreads
through these more range-limited,

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:47.419
large-droplet routes,

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:49.421
there's all these other sorts of diseases

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.421
that can be spread in the airplane cabin.

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:54.629
The worst part is, when we take
a look at some of the numbers,

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.066
it's pretty scary.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.850
So with H1N1,

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:00.263
there was this guy that decided
to go on the plane

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:02.058
and in the matter of a single flight

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.336
actually spread the disease
to 17 other people.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.488
And then there was this
other guy with SARS,

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.614
who managed to go on a three-hour flight

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:11.480
and spread the disease to 22 other people.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.912
That's not exactly my idea
of a great superpower.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.222
When we take a look at this,
what we also find

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:21.222
is that it's very difficult
to pre-screen for these diseases.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.710
So when someone actually
goes on a plane,

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:24.940
they could be sick

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:27.359
and they could actually
be in this latency period

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:29.542
in which they could actually
have the disease

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.138
but not exhibit any symptoms,

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.353
and they could, in turn,
spread the disease

00:01:33.377 --> 00:01:35.050
to many other people in the cabin.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.156
How that actually works is that right now

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.466
we've got air coming in
from the top of the cabin

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.916
and from the side of the cabin,
as you see in blue.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.142
And then also, that air goes out
through these very efficient filters

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.714
that eliminate 99.97 percent
of pathogens near the outlets.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.921
What happens right now, though,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.012
is that we have this
mixing airflow pattern.

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:56.868
So if someone were to actually sneeze,

00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:59.596
that air would get swirled
around multiple times

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.865
before it even has a chance
to go out through the filter.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.998
So I thought: clearly, this
is a pretty serious problem.

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:10.755
I didn't have the money
to go out and buy a plane,

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.017
so I decided to build a computer instead.

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.313
It actually turns out that
with computational fluid dynamics,

00:02:16.337 --> 00:02:18.938
what we're able to do
is create these simulations

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.756
that give us higher resolutions

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.400
than actually physically going
in and taking readings in the plane.

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:27.850
And so how, essentially, this works
is you would start out

00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:29.546
with these 2D drawings --

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.698
these are floating around
in technical papers around the Internet.

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:35.615
I take that and then I put it
into this 3D-modeling software,

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.418
really building that 3D model.

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:41.901
And then I divide that model
that I just built into these tiny pieces,

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:45.502
essentially meshing it so that
the computer can better understand it.

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:49.247
And then I tell the computer where
the air goes in and out of the cabin,

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:50.770
throw in a bunch of physics

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:55.015
and basically sit there and wait until
the computer calculates the simulation.

00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:59.642
So what we get, actually,
with the conventional cabin is this:

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.913
you'll notice the middle person sneezing,

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:06.159
and we go "Splat!" -- it goes
right into people's faces.

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.703
It's pretty disgusting.

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:11.075
From the front, you'll notice
those two passengers

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.885
sitting next to the central passenger

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.615
not exactly having a great time.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.825
And when we take a look
at that from the side,

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.842
you'll also notice those pathogens
spreading across the length of the cabin.

00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:24.367
The first thing I thought was,
"This is no good."

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.899
So I actually conducted
more than 32 different simulations

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:31.288
and ultimately, I came up
with this solution right here.

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:34.828
This is what I call a -- patent pending --
Global Inlet Director.

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:37.418
With this, we're able to reduce
pathogen transmission

00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:39.210
by about 55 times,

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:42.387
and increase fresh-air inhalation
by about 190 percent.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.015
So how this actually works

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.168
is we would install this piece
of composite material

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:50.160
into these existing spots
that are already in the plane.

00:03:50.184 --> 00:03:52.185
So it's very cost-effective to install

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.057
and we can do this directly overnight.

00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:57.629
All we have to do is put a couple
of screws in there and you're good to go.

00:03:57.653 --> 00:04:00.512
And the results that we get
are absolutely amazing.

00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:04.072
Instead of having those problematic
swirling airflow patterns,

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:05.838
we can create these walls of air

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:08.032
that come down in-between the passengers

00:04:08.056 --> 00:04:09.954
to create personalized breathing zones.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:12.963
So you'll notice the middle passenger
here is sneezing again,

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:15.700
but this time, we're able
to effectively push that down

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:18.437
to the filters for elimination.

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.857
And same thing from the side,

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:23.110
you'll notice we're able to directly
push those pathogens down.

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:27.176
So if you take a look again now
at the same scenario

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.889
but with this innovation installed,

00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:30.929
you'll notice the middle
passenger sneezes,

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:34.026
and this time, we're pushing
that straight down into the outlet

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.771
before it gets a chance
to infect any other people.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:40.919
So you'll notice the two passengers
sitting next to the middle guy

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:43.176
are breathing virtually
no pathogens at all.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.728
Take a look at that from the side as well,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.307
you see a very efficient system.

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:49.953
And in short, with this system, we win.

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:54.144
When we take a look at what this means,

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:57.640
what we see is that this not only works
if the middle passenger sneezes,

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:00.438
but also if the window-seat
passenger sneezes

00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:02.557
or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:06.254
And so with this solution, what does
this mean for the world?

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:09.792
Well, when we take a look at this

00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:12.385
from the computer simulation
into real life,

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.171
we can see with this 3D model
that I built over here,

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:17.283
essentially using 3D printing,

00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:20.266
we can see those same
airflow patterns coming down,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.876
right to the passengers.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.990
In the past, the SARS epidemic
actually cost the world

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.943
about 40 billion dollars.

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:29.126
And in the future,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.696
a big disease outbreak
could actually cost the world

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.578
in excess of three trillion dollars.

00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:37.419
So before, it used to be that you had
to take an airplane out of service

00:05:37.443 --> 00:05:39.315
for one to two months,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.911
spend tens of thousands of man hours
and several million dollars

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:44.258
to try to change something.

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:47.793
But now, we're able to install
something essentially overnight

00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:49.544
and see results right away.

00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:52.774
So it's really now a matter of taking
this through to certification,

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:53.988
flight testing,

00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:57.004
and going through all of these
regulatory approvals processes.

00:05:57.028 --> 00:06:00.092
But it just really goes to show
that sometimes the best solutions

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:01.554
are the simplest solutions.

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:05.125
And two years ago, even,

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.918
this project would not have happened,

00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:09.768
just because the technology then
wouldn't have supported it.

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:12.261
But now with advanced computing

00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:14.471
and how developed our Internet is,

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:17.134
it's really the golden era for innovation.

00:06:17.158 --> 00:06:20.401
And so the question I ask all
of you today is: why wait?

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.746
Together, we can build the future today.

00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:24.274
Thanks.

00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:27.404
(Applause)
