00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:20.709
In the past several days, I heard people talking about China.

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:24.663
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.126
Something is very challenging to me.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:30.187
I want to make my friends understand:

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:33.755
China is complicated.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:35.850
So I always want to tell the story, like,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.306
one hand it is that, the other hand is that.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.092
You can't just tell a one sided story.

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.273
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:50.683
BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:56.509
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.678
But at the same time, on the other hand,

00:00:59.678 --> 00:01:02.582
China is a SICK country,

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:08.538
the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file.

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:14.820
He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.500
The four countries have no access to Facebook.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.618
So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:24.612
(Laughter)

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:26.507
Another project was built up

00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:29.351
to watch China and Chinese Internet.

00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:32.734
And now, today I want to tell you my personal

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:37.966
observation in the past several years, from that wall.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.527
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:46.510
you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.386
It prevents weird things from the north.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:54.583
Same was true for China.

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:58.143
In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:03.515
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:07.578
But China also has a great firewall.

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:11.907
That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:16.232
It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.936
from the universal values, but also to prevent

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:23.611
China's own citizens to access the global free Internet,

00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:28.899
and even separate themselves into blocks, not united.

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:33.045
So, basically the "Internet" has two Internets.

00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:37.037
One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:40.829
But if you think the Chinanet is something

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.351
like a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.

00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:53.088
But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,

00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:56.111
to describe in the past 15 years

00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:59.511
the continuing fight between Chinese

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.791
censorship, government censorship, the cat,

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:08.943
and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:13.136
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:18.571
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.

00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:22.333
In China, we have 500 million Internet users.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:27.188
That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.

00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:32.699
So even though China's is a totally censored Internet,

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.293
but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:39.003
How to make it? It's simple.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.704
You have Google, we have Baidu.

00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.818
You have Twitter, we have Weibo.

00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:47.843
You have Facebook, we have Renren.

00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:53.176
You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:57.706
The Chinese government blocked every

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:01.417
single international Web 2.0 service,

00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:04.233
and we Chinese copycat every one.

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:05.626
(Laughter)

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:10.241
So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.

00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:13.809
That's not only to censor you.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.408
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:20.795
Block and clone.

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:25.899
On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:29.179
which is very important; people really love social networking.

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:32.004
But on the other hand, they want to keep the server

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:36.534
in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:40.782
That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,

00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:42.591
because they can't accept the fact

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:47.390
that Chinese government wants to keep the server.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.818
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.

00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:56.571
For example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.

00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:59.683
He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.

00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:05.373
But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.

00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:08.653
And now the result is very simple.

00:05:08.653 --> 00:05:14.263
We all know Mubarak is technically dead.

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:18.775
But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.701
didn't follow the second rule.

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.654
That means keep the server in your hands.

00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:30.499
He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.901
to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:37.473
So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post

00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:40.125
critical videos against his corruption.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:44.174
The same thing happend. He was the first

00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:47.191
to topple during the Arab Spring.

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:52.341
But those two very smart international censorship policies

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:58.678
didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,

00:05:58.678 --> 00:06:04.351
a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.

00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:08.879
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.711
It's the entire population of the United States.

00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:16.575
So when these 300 million people, microbloggers,

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:21.343
even they block the tweet in our censored platform.

00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:25.330
But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.425
very powerful energy, which has never happened

00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:31.079
in the Chinese history.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:35.775
2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed,

00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:38.031
in Wenzhou, a southern city.

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.655
Right after the train crash,

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:44.671
authorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.887
So it angered the Chinese Netizens.

00:06:46.887 --> 00:06:49.950
The first five days after the train crash,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.095
there were 10 million criticisms of the posting

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:57.848
on social media, which never happened in Chinese history.

00:06:57.848 --> 00:07:01.176
And later this year, the rail minister

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:06.642
was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:11.689
And also, recently, very funny debate between

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.985
the Beijing Environment Ministry

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:18.353
and the American Embassy in Beijing

00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:20.818
because the Ministry blamed

00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:22.963
the American Embassy for intervening in

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:26.392
Chinese internal politics by disclosing

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:29.076
the air quality data of Beijing.

00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:35.964
So, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.

00:07:35.964 --> 00:07:41.908
He showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.

00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:45.710
So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.334
But that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.

00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:54.686
He says it's good. It's good to go outside.

00:07:54.686 --> 00:07:58.230
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.990
stand firmly on the Embassy's side.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.662
I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch

00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:15.393
the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:19.684
Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,

00:08:19.684 --> 00:08:23.928
so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:27.600
You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.065
a limitation of 140 characters.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:34.264
But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:37.512
Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!"

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:40.046
(Laughter)

00:08:40.046 --> 00:08:45.791
But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.467
means a paragraph, a story.

00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:52.705
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there.

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:56.392
For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.

00:08:56.392 --> 00:09:00.183
It's the same content. One, you can see exactly

00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:06.696
one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:09.953
Chinese is always cheating, right?

00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:13.866
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:18.947
microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.

00:09:18.947 --> 00:09:22.658
And also, the clone, Sina company is

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.745
the guy who cloned Twitter.

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:27.166
It even has its own name, with Weibo.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.601
"Weibo" is the Chinese translation for "microblog".

00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:31.505
It has its own innovation.

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:35.138
At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo

00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:38.880
more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.304
So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,

00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:45.624
when it came to China in 2009,

00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:49.637
it immediately became a media platform itself.

00:09:49.637 --> 00:09:53.838
It became the media platform of 300 million readers.

00:09:53.838 --> 00:09:55.739
It became the media.

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:58.164
Anything not mentioned in Weibo,

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:03.448
it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.

00:10:03.448 --> 00:10:05.884
But also, Chinese social media is

00:10:05.884 --> 00:10:10.279
really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:13.768
For example, they give the voiceless people

00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:16.521
a channel to make your voice heard.

00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:21.964
We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:25.041
because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.667
The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:33.058
So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:36.689
want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:39.484
they want the emperor to settle the problem.

00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.323
But when more and more people go to Beijing,

00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:45.846
they also cause the risk of a revolution.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:48.718
So they send them back in recent years.

00:10:48.718 --> 00:10:52.285
And even some of them were put into black jails.

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:55.886
But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:58.725
People just use their cell phones to tweet.

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:02.302
So your sad stories, by some chance your story

00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:05.943
will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.

00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:07.856
One of them is Yao Chen,

00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:11.245
she is the most popular microblogger in China,

00:11:11.245 --> 00:11:15.104
who has about 21 million followers.

00:11:15.104 --> 00:11:18.726
They're almost like a national TV station.

00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:22.062
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her.

00:11:22.062 --> 00:11:26.510
So this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:32.250
still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.574
every day chatting together, talking together.

00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:38.480
It's like a big TED, right?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.328
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere

00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:44.032
happened in China.

00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:47.247
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:50.432
and talk to people.

00:11:50.432 --> 00:11:54.136
But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:58.382
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.

00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:01.589
For example, you can't post the name of the president,

00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:07.167
Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:11.901
and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.

00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:16.234
So, the Chinese are very good at these puns

00:12:16.234 --> 00:12:19.906
and alternative wording and even memes.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.151
They even name themselves -- you know,

00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.646
use the name of this world-changing

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:28.617
battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.626
The grass-mud horse is caoníma,

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:33.580
is the phonogram for motherfucker,

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.796
the Netizens call themselves.

00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:42.413
River crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:45.307
harmonization, for censorship.

00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:50.427
So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.

00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:56.404
So, when some very political, exciting moments happened,

00:12:56.404 --> 00:13:01.985
you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:06.817
Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD

00:13:06.817 --> 00:13:10.284
of Chinese language, you can't understand them.

00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:13.107
But you can't even expand more, no, because

00:13:13.107 --> 00:13:16.030
Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:21.166
was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:23.262
That means from the very beginning,

00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:27.454
Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government,

00:13:27.454 --> 00:13:30.198
we will not become the stage for

00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:32.790
any kind of a threat to the regime.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.990
For example, anything you want to post,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.885
like "get together" or "meet up" or "walk,"

00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:42.078
it is automatically recorded and data mined

00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:48.606
and reported to a poll for further political analyzing.

00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:50.606
Even if you want to have some gathering,

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:54.286
before you go there, the police are already waiting for you.

00:13:54.286 --> 00:13:56.094
Why? Because they have the data.

00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:58.286
They have everything in their hands.

00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:04.510
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.109
So the crackdown is very serious.

00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:10.650
But I want you to notice a very funny thing

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.538
during the process of the cat-and-mouse.

00:14:13.538 --> 00:14:17.763
The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,

00:14:17.763 --> 00:14:21.391
but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.

00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:23.317
(Laughter)

00:14:23.317 --> 00:14:26.391
You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,

00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:31.013
so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government,

00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:35.651
the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.539
Without bribing the central cats,

00:14:37.539 --> 00:14:40.965
he can do nothing, only apologize.

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:43.693
So these three years, in the past three years,

00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:46.339
social movements about microblogging

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:48.700
really changed local government,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.956
became more and more transparent,

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:53.804
because they can't access the data.

00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:57.417
The server is in Beijing.

00:14:57.417 --> 00:14:58.887
The story about the train crash,

00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:02.094
maybe the question is not about why 10 million

00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:06.340
criticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.564
allowed the five days of freedom of speech online.

00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:11.473
It's never happened before.

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:14.924
And so it's very simple, because even the top leaders

00:15:14.924 --> 00:15:18.445
were fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.

00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:20.115
So they want an excuse --

00:15:20.115 --> 00:15:23.572
public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.

00:15:23.572 --> 00:15:26.542
But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:27.873
he's a princeling.

00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:31.992
But from February to April this year,

00:15:31.992 --> 00:15:34.695
Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors.

00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:38.032
You can almost joke everything about these princelings,

00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:41.432
everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.

00:15:41.432 --> 00:15:46.081
But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup

00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:50.024
about Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.

00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:55.947
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.

00:15:55.947 --> 00:15:59.816
So Chinese in China, censorship is normal.

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:02.561
Something you find is, freedom is weird.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.328
Something will happen behind it.

00:16:04.328 --> 00:16:07.484
Because he was a very popular Leftist leader,

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:09.688
so the central government wanted to purge him,

00:16:09.688 --> 00:16:13.770
and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.600
why he is so bad.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.378
So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:23.889
became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:26.046
But this technology is very new,

00:16:26.046 --> 00:16:27.712
but technically is very old.

00:16:27.712 --> 00:16:30.640
It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.537
because he mobilized millions of Chinese people

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:37.619
in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:40.489
It's very simple, because Chinese central government

00:16:40.489 --> 00:16:42.625
doesn't need to even lead the public opinion.

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:47.156
They just give them a target window to not censor people.

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:53.065
Not censoring in China has become a political tool.

00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:57.035
So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.

00:16:57.035 --> 00:16:59.205
Social media changed Chinese mindset.

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:02.715
More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech

00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:04.875
and human rights as their birthright,

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:08.497
not some imported American privilege.

00:17:08.497 --> 00:17:12.209
But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:16.539
for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:19.110
preparing for future democracy.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.566
But it didn't change the Chinese political system,

00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:24.811
and also the Chinese central government utilized this

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:28.747
centralized server structure to strengthen its power

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:33.245
to counter the local government and the different factions.

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:36.017
So, what's the future?

00:17:36.017 --> 00:17:38.201
After all, we are the mouse.

00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:42.001
Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].

00:17:42.001 --> 00:17:45.992
There is not only in China, but also in the United States

00:17:45.992 --> 00:17:50.821
there are some very small, cute but bad cats.

00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:52.465
(Laughter)

00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:59.203
SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:04.558
And also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,

00:18:04.558 --> 00:18:08.745
but sometimes we see them dating the cats.

00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:11.929
So my conclusion is very simple.

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:14.774
We Chinese fight for our freedom,

00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:18.369
you just watch your bad cats.

00:18:18.369 --> 00:18:21.272
Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.

00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:24.113
Only in this way, in the future,

00:18:24.113 --> 00:18:27.361
we will achieve the dreams of the mouse:

00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:31.337
that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.

00:18:31.337 --> 00:18:38.696
(Applause)

00:18:38.696 --> 00:18:40.381
Thank you.

00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.729
(Applause)
