00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm going to talk about your mindset.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
(Laughter)

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
When I talk to my students about global issues,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and I listen to them in the coffee break,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
they always talk about "we" and "them."

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
And when they come back into the lecture room

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
"We learned it in college."

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And what is the definition then? "The definition?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Everyone knows," they say.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
But then you know, I press them like this.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Western world is a long life in a small family.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Developing world is a short life in a large family."

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And I like that definition, because it enabled me

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
to transfer their mindset

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
into the dataset.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
And here you have the dataset.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
is size of family. One, two, three, four, five

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
children per woman on this axis.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
And here, length of life, life expectancy,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
30, 40, 50.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And really this is about the bedroom.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
you can live long.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
which had large families and short life. Developing world.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And we had one set of countries up there

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
which was the western world.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
They had small families and long life.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And you are going to see here

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
Then the developing countries applied

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
soap and water, vaccination.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
And all the developing world started to apply family planning.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
And partly to USA who help to provide

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
technical advice and investment.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
and a life with 60 to 70 years.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
But some countries remain back in this area here.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
We have Liberia. We have Congo.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
So we have countries living there.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
So the problem I had

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160
is that the worldview that my students had

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
corresponds to reality in the world

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
the year their teachers were born.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
(Laughter)

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
(Applause)

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
And we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and I could see the wrong concept

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
even active people in United States had,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
that they didn't realize the improvement

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
Look here when I move them forward.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Here we go.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
They catch up. There's Mexico.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
There was less than five percent

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
This great nation, Mexico,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
has the problem that arms are coming from North,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
across the borders, so they had to stop that,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
But if I would change this axis here,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
I would instead put income per person.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Income per person. I can put that here.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
And we will then see

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
a completely different picture.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
By the way, I'm teaching you

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
how to use our website, Gapminder World,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
while I'm correcting this,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
because this is a free utility on the net.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And when I now finally got it right,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
I can go back 200 years in history.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
And I can find United States up there.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And I can let the other countries be shown.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And now I have income per person on this axis.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
on par with Afghanistan today.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And what has happened in the world, I will show now.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
This is instead of studying history

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
for one year at university.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
(Laughter)

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
and the yellow one, which is the United States,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
they get richer and richer and also

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
start to get healthier and healthier.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
And this is now 100 years ago,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
where the rest of the world remains behind.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.160
Here we come. And that was the influenza.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
And then we come up. Not until

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
independence started.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Look here You have China over there,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
you have India over there,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.160
and this is what has happened.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
but they are quite close.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
And especially, it's interesting to see

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
China and the United States

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
during 200 years,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
because I have my oldest son now working for Google,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
after Google acquired this software.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
for many years and developed this.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.160
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
in China, he got a long-term perspective.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.160
he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
But in China they look generation after generation

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
because they remember

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
when they went backwards.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And then they would remember the first part

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
of last century, which was really bad,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
But this was 1963.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
this amazing move forward.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
Isn't it strange to see that the United States

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.160
because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
and then also benefits of penicillin

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
and vaccines and family planning.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And Asia could have social development

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
before they got the economic development.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
So to me, as a public health professor,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Because what you see here, what you see here

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
isn't it.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
It's not really, really flat.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
But the middle income countries --

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
and this is where I suggest to my students,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
stop using the concept "developing world."

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Because after all, talking about the developing world

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
The last chapter is about present, and president Obama,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
and the other is about the past,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
where you cover everything from Washington

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
to Eisenhower.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
Because Washington to Eisenhower,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
that is what we find in the developing world.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
We could actually go to Mayflower

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
to Eisenhower,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
and that would be put together into a developing world,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
which have great entrepreneurs,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
but also have the collapsing countries.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
So, how could we make better sense about this?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
look at income distribution.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
from $1. This is where you have food to eat.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
These people go to bed hungry.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And this is the number of people.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
This is $10, whether you have a public or a private

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
health service system. This is where you can

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
provide health service for your family and school for your children,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
and this is OECD countries:

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
Green, Latin America, East Europe.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
And this is how the world changed.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
It changed like this.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
And it goes over here?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
And I come now, into projections,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
(Laughter)

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
that's where the projections are not valid any longer.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Probably the world will do this.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and then it will continue forward like this.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
But more or less, this is what will happen,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.160
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
We have the high income countries here,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
with the United States as a leading power;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
we have the emerging economies in the middle,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
and we have the low income countries here.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
they have been saving, you know, over the last decade.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
And here we have the low income countries

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
where entrepreneurs are.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
And here we have the countries in collapse and war,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.160
like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
We have all this at the same time.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
in the developing world.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
Because it's so different, what has happened there.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
And that's why I suggest

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
a slightly different approach of what you would call it.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
And you have huge differences within countries also.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
I heard that your departments here were by regions.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
East Asia, Arab states,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
And on this axis, GDP.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
And on this, heath, child survival,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
and it doesn't come as a surprise

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
But when I split it, when I split it

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
into country bubbles,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
the size of the bubbles here is the population.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
Arab world.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Now all your different departments.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
We cannot put it into two parts.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
building, building countries.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
And then it's United States today, up here.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
And we have countries all this way.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Now, this is the important thing

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.160
of understanding how the world has changed.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
At this point I decided to make a pause.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
(Laughter)

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
And it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
for Demographic Health Survey.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
This is very serious.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
during 25 years of the very good methodology

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
for measuring child mortality

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.160
(Applause)

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
And it is U.S. government at its best,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
without advocacy, providing facts,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
that it's useful for the society.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
And providing data free of charge

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Quite the opposite of the World Bank,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
who compiled data with government money,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.160
(Applause)

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
But the people doing that at the World Bank

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
are among the best in the world.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
And they are highly skilled professionals.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.160
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
And when it comes to free data and transparency,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
United States of America is one of the best.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
(Laughter)

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
And I'm not paid to come here, no.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
I would like to show you what happens with the data,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
what we can show with this data.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Look here. This is the world.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
With income down there and child mortality.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
And what has happened in the world?

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
Since 1950, during the last 50 years

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
we have had a fall in child mortality.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And we had an increase in income.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
And the blue former developing countries

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.160
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.160
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
as we have had, always, in history.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
about a completely new approach to do it.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
And how fast has this happened?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
Well, MDG 4.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
The United States has not been so eager

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
to use MDG 4.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Let's see what Sweden has done.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
We used to boast about fast social progress.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
That's where we were, 1900.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
1900, Sweden was there.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
though they had lower income.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
They started very well. They used the aid well.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
They vaccinated the kids. They get better water.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And they reduced child mortality,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.160
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Second round, it's Sweden, 1916,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
against Egypt, 1990.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
They get safe water, they get food for the poor,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
and they get malaria eradicated.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Brazil here has amazing social improvement

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
over the last 16 years,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
and they go faster than Sweden.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
This means that the world is converging.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
The middle income countries,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
the emerging economy, they are catching up.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
They are moving to cities,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
where they also get better assistance for that.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Well the Swedish students protest at this point.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
They say, "This is not fair,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
that were not available for Sweden.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
We have to do real-time competition."

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
It's the most tropical country in the world,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
a marshland on the equator.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
But then they started to grow their economy.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
And they made the social investment. They got away malaria.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
They got a magnificent health system

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
that beat both the U.S. and Sweden.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:37.160
(Applause)

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160
These yellow are just about to be doing this.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
Not simplistic extrapolation.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
We have to really find a way

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
of supporting those countries in a better way.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
We have to respect the middle income countries

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
on what they are doing.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
The blue is Africa.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
You see the tragedy in South Africa there.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
And in spite of them having quite a high income,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
they have a huge number of HIV infected.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
But you also see that there are African countries down here.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.160
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
that has the same level as Sweden and United States.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
And there are others who are extremely high.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
And I will show you that what has happened

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160
in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
They have a very high level. It's coming down.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
But now it's not falling,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
because there, with help from PEPFAR,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
And you can see it's not that easy,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
that it is war which caused this.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
Because here, in Congo, there is war.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160
And here, in Zambia, there is peace.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
If I split Tanzania in its income,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
the richer 20 percent in Tanzania

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
has more HIV than the poorest one.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
And it's really different within each country.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
And this is the situation you see.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
probably of concurrent sexual partnership

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
among part of the heterosexual population

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
in some countries, or some parts of countries,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
in south and eastern Africa.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.160
Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
in the way it can be done there.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
So to just end up,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
there are things of suffering

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
in the one billion poorest, which we don't know.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
Those who live beyond the cellphone,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
those who have yet to see a computer,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
those who have no electricity at home.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
This is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
elucidating in Africa.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.160
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
It's similar to other nutritional diseases.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
It will never affect a rich person.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.160
We have seen it here in Mozambique.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.160
This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
You never heard about the disease.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
But it's much more than Ebola

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
that has been affected by this disease.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
Cause crippling throughout the world.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
And over the last two years,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
2,000 people has been crippled

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
in the southern tip of Bandundu region.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160
That used to be the illegal diamond trade,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
That has now disappeared,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
and they are now in great economic problem.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
And one week ago, for the first time,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
there were four lines on the Internet.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
and the great capacity

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160
of people in the middle income countries

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.160
and in peaceful low income countries.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
There is still mystery in one billion.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
And we have to have more concepts

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160
than just developing countries and developing world.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.160
We need a new mindset. The world is converging,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.160
but -- but -- but not the bottom billion.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.160
They are still as poor as they've ever been.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.160
It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
But you will remain

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
one of the most important superpowers,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
And this institution

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
will have a very crucial role,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
not for United States, but for the world.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160
So you have a very bad name,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
State Department. This is not the State Department.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
It's the World Department.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.160
And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.160
(Applause)
