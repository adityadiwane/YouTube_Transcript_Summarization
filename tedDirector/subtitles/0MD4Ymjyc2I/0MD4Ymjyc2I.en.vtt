00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.739
I have spent the last years

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.398
trying to resolve two enigmas:

00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:21.759
Why is productivity so disappointing

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.641
in all the companies where I work?

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.335
I have worked with more than 500 companies.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:29.780
Despite all the technological advances --

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.072
computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:35.433
the Internet.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:36.831
Enigma number two:

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.863
Why is there so little engagement at work?

00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:41.967
Why do people feel so miserable,

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:45.617
even actively disengaged?

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:47.141
Disengaging their colleagues.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.872
Acting against the interest of their company.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:55.976
Despite all the affiliation events,

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:59.973
the celebration, the people initiatives,

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:02.572
the leadership development programs to train

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:06.956
managers on how to better motivate their teams.

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:08.694
At the beginning, I thought there was

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:10.663
a chicken and egg issue:

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:13.215
Because people are less engaged, 
they are less productive.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.452
Or vice versa, because they are less productive,

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:17.643
we put more pressure and they are less engaged.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.511
But as we were doing our analysis

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:21.432
we realized that there was a common root cause

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:22.815
to these two issues

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:27.371
that relates, in fact, to the basic 
pillars of management.

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.541
The way we organize is based on two pillars.

00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.294
The hard -- structure, processes, systems.

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:34.518
The soft --

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:39.973
feelings, sentiments, interpersonal
relationships, traits, personality.

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:41.445
And whenever a company

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:45.155
reorganizes, restructures, reengineers,

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.603
goes through a cultural transformation program,

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:49.633
it chooses these two pillars.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.682
Now, we try to refine them,

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:53.578
we try to combine them.

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:55.206
The real issue is --

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:57.243
and this is the answer to the two enigmas --

00:01:57.243 --> 00:02:00.177
these pillars are obsolete.

00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:02.859
Everything you read in business books is based

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.524
either on one or the other

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.791
or their combination.

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.105
They are obsolete.

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.402
How do they work

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:11.689
when you try to use these approaches

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.837
in front of the new complexity of business?

00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:16.834
The hard approach, basically 
is that you start from strategy,

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:20.463
requirements, structures, processes, 
systems, KPIs, scorecards,

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:23.340
committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.450
you name it.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.881
I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, 
middle offices and interfaces.

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.876
What happens basically on the left,

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:35.140
you have more complexity, the 
new complexity of business.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.427
We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:41.813
And every time there is a new requirement,

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:43.292
we use the same approach.

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.405
We create dedicated structure processed systems,

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:49.643
basically to deal with the 
new complexity of business.

00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:53.382
The hard approach creates just complicatedness

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.220
in the organization.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.798
Let's take an example.

00:02:56.798 --> 00:02:59.694
An automotive company, the engineering division

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:01.486
is a five-dimensional matrix.

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.518
If you open any cell of the matrix,

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:06.531
you find another 20-dimensional matrix.

00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:09.394
You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,

00:03:09.394 --> 00:03:11.352
Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:13.182
For any new requirement,

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:15.057
you have a dedicated function

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.846
in charge of aligning engineers against

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.394
the new requirement.

00:03:19.394 --> 00:03:21.993
What happens when the new 
requirement emerges?

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.085
Some years ago, a new requirement

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.932
appeared on the marketplace:

00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:28.083
the length of the warranty period.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.018
So therefore the new requirement is repairability,

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:32.518
making cars easy to repair.

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:36.524
Otherwise when you bring the car 
to the garage to fix the light,

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:38.781
if you have to remove the engine

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:40.110
to access the lights,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.549
the car will have to stay one week in the garage

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.436
instead of two hours, and the 
warranty budget will explode.

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:48.381
So, what was the solution using the hard approach?

00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:51.431
If repairability is the new requirement,

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.520
the solution is to create a new function,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.693
Mr. Repairability.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:59.636
And Mr. Repairability creates 
the repairability process.

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:03.494
With a repairability scorecard, 
with a repairability metric

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.308
and eventually repairability incentive.

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:10.072
That came on top of 25 other KPIs.

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:13.578
What percentage of these people is variable compensation?

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:17.405
Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:21.502
repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.562
What difference did it make in their actions,

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:26.184
their choices to simplify? Zero.

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:29.849
But what occurs for zero impact? 
Mr. Repairability, process,

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.522
scorecard, evaluation, coordination 
with the 25 other coordinators

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:36.418
to have zero impact.

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:38.959
Now, in front of the new complexity of business,

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.896
the only solution is not drawing boxes

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.322
with reporting lines.

00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:47.407
It is basically the interplay.

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.978
How the parts work together.

00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:54.710
The connections, the interactions, the synapses.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.213
It is not the skeleton of boxes, 
it is the nervous system

00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:02.250
of adaptiveness and intelligence.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.150
You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.689
Whenever people cooperate,

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.617
they use less resources. In everything.

00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:14.149
You know, the repairability issue

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:16.901
is a cooperation problem.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.122
When you design cars, please take into account

00:05:20.122 --> 00:05:22.830
the needs of those who will repair the cars

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.937
in the after sales garages.

00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:28.554
When we don't cooperate we need more time,

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:32.336
more equipment, more systems, more teams.

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:37.427
We need -- When procurement, supply 
chain, manufacturing don't cooperate

00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:40.205
we need more stock, more inventories, 
more working capital.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.146
Who will pay for that?

00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:44.108
Shareholders? Customers?

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.439
No, they will refuse.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.248
So who is left? 
The employees,

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.956
who have to compensate through their super

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:54.276
individual efforts for the lack of cooperation.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:57.944
Stress, burnout, they are 
overwhelmed, accidents.

00:05:57.944 --> 00:06:00.768
No wonder they disengage.

00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:04.565
How do the hard and the soft
try to foster cooperation?

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:09.195
The hard: In banks, when there is a problem

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:12.255
between the back office and the front office,

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:14.345
they don't cooperate. What is the solution?

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.440
They create a middle office.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.476
What happens one year later?

00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:21.484
Instead of one problem 
between the back and the front,

00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:22.838
now I have two problems.

00:06:22.838 --> 00:06:23.961
Between the back and the middle

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.177
and between the middle and the front.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.642
Plus I have to pay for the middle office.

00:06:28.642 --> 00:06:31.900
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.336
It can only add new boxes, 
new bones in the skeleton.

00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:37.971
The soft approach:

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:41.800
To make people cooperate, we need 
to make them like each other.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.494
Improve interpersonal feelings,

00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:46.450
the more people like each other, 
the more they will cooperate.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.221
It is totally wrong.

00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:50.621
It is even counterproductive.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.037
Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:55.909
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.549
(Laughter)

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:00.453
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:04.463
And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife

00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:07.130
is precisely because I love my wife.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.355
If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:

00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:12.850
You will watch my favorite football game,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.405
if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:16.608
(Laughter)

00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:18.489
The more we like each other,

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:21.102
the more we avoid the real cooperation

00:07:21.102 --> 00:07:25.276
that would strain our relationships 
by imposing tough tradeoffs.

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:28.283
And we go for a second TV or we escalate

00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:31.207
the decision above for arbitration.

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:35.916
Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:39.699
To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:42.961
we have created what we call 
the smart simplicity approach

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:44.481
based on simple rules.

00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:46.743
Simple rule number one:

00:07:46.743 --> 00:07:49.768
Understand what others do.

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.665
What is their real work?

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:55.300
We need to go beyond the boxes,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.318
the job descriptions, beyond the surface

00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:02.823
of the container, to understand the real content.

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:05.531
Me, designer, if I put a wire here,

00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.534
I know that it will mean that we will have to

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:10.100
remove the engine to access the lights.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.948
Second, you need to reenforce integrators.

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:16.808
Integrators are not middle 
offices, they are managers,

00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:18.569
existing managers that you reinforce

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:21.003
so that they have power and interest

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:23.166
to make others cooperate.

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:26.898
How can you reinforce your 
managers as integrators?

00:08:26.898 --> 00:08:28.373
By removing layers.

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:29.737
When there are too many layers

00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:31.287
people are too far from the action,

00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:33.401
therefore they need KPIs, metrics,

00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:37.729
they need poor proxies for reality.

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:39.331
They don't understand reality

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:42.431
and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.

00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:44.883
By removing rules -- the bigger we are,

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:46.516
the more we need integrators,

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:48.837
therefore the less rules we must have,

00:08:48.837 --> 00:08:52.731
to give discretionary power to managers.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:53.858
And we do the opposite --

00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:56.044
the bigger we are, the more rules we create.

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:59.294
And we end up with the Encyclopedia 
Britannica of rules.

00:08:59.294 --> 00:09:01.394
You need to increase the quanitity of power

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:03.122
so that you can empower everybody

00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:06.108
to use their judgment, their intelligence.

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:08.259
You must give more cards to people

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:11.616
so that they have the critical mass of cards

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:13.575
to take the risk to cooperate,

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:15.330
to move out of insulation.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.694
Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.

00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:19.940
These rules, they come from game theory

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.168
and organizational sociology.

00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:25.020
You can increase the shadow of the future.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.921
Create feedback loops that expose people

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:30.522
to the consequences of their actions.

00:09:30.522 --> 00:09:32.466
This is what the automotive company did

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.256
when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.

00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:36.891
They said to the design engineers:

00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:41.586
Now, in three years, when the new 
car is launched on the market,

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.530
you will move to the after sales 
network, and become in charge

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.905
of the warranty budget,

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:50.284
and if the warranty budget explodes,

00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:52.951
it will explode in your face. (Laughter)

00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:58.892
Much more powerful than 0.8 
percent variable compensation.

00:09:58.892 --> 00:10:02.614
You need also to increase reciprocity,

00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:06.329
by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.801
When you remove these buffers,

00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:11.798
you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:13.180
We will cooperate.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.720
Remove the second TV.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.964
There are many second TVs at work

00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:18.265
that don't create value,

00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:22.953
they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:25.382
You need to reward those who cooperate

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:27.061
and blame those who don't cooperate.

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:30.130
The CEO of The Lego Group,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.953
Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.

00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:35.858
He says, blame is not for failure,

00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:40.393
it is for failing to help or ask for help.

00:10:40.393 --> 00:10:42.772
It changes everything.

00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:45.292
Suddenly it becomes in my
interest to be transparent

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:47.332
on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:49.418
because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,

00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:53.286
but if I fail to help or ask for help.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.213
When you do this, it has a lot of implications

00:10:56.213 --> 00:10:59.158
on organizational design.

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.576
You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:02.966
you look at their interplay.

00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:05.945
It has a lot of implications on financial policies

00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:07.159
that we use.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:09.781
On human resource management practices.

00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:12.205
When you do that, you can manage complexity,

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:13.798
the new complexity of business,

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.731
without getting complicated.

00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.381
You create more value with lower cost.

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:24.955
You simultaneously improve 
performance and satisfaction at work

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:27.684
because you have removed the common root cause

00:11:27.684 --> 00:11:29.300
that hinders both.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.010
Complicatedness: This is your 
battle, business leaders.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.837
The real battle is not against competitors.

00:11:36.837 --> 00:11:39.258
This is rubbish, very abstract.

00:11:39.258 --> 00:11:41.921
When do we meet competitors to fight them?

00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:44.822
The real battle is against ourselves,

00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:48.176
against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:51.333
Only you can fight, can do it.

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.420
Thank you.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.112
(Applause)
