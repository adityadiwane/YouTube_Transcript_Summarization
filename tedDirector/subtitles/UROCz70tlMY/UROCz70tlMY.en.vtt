00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in the 21st century.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
is to go back to our school days

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
when we learned how to count.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Because what we actually count

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
truly counts.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Let me start by telling you a little story.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
This is Van Quach.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
She changed her name to Vivian

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
because she wanted to fit in here in America.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Her first job was at an inner-city motel

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
in San Francisco as a maid.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I happened to buy that motel

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
about three months after Vivian started working there.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
in 1987,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
a very impractical name,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
in the inner-city of San Francisco.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
As I spent time with Vivian,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
in how she did her work.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
It made me question and curious:

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
How could someone actually find joy

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
in cleaning toilets for a living?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Her job, her goal and her calling

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And what gave her inspiration and meaning

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
was the fact that she was taking care of people

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
who were far away from home.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
That very human lesson,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
more than 20 years ago,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
served me well during the last

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
economic downturn we had.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
San Francisco Bay Area hotels

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
went through the largest percentage revenue drop

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in the history of American hotels.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
so we were particularly vulnerable.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But also back then,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Well, not exactly, of course not.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
We started eating "freedom fries,"

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and we started boycotting anything that was French.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
so I started getting these letters

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
from places like Alabama and Orange County

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
because they thought we were a French company.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
(Laughter)

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
So one particular day

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
looking for a business solution.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
in the self-help section very quickly.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
That's where I got reacquainted with

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
I took one psychology class in college,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
But as I sat there for four hours,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I recognized something

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that is true of most leaders.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
One of the simplest facts in business

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
is something that we often neglect,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and that is that we're all human.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
has some hierarchy of needs

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in the workplace.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
So as I started reading more Maslow,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
what I started to realize is that

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Maslow, later in his life,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and apply it to the collective,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to organizations and specifically to business.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So I realized in that dotcom crash

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And that's what I did a few years ago

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
which is survival, success and transformation.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And we started asking ourselves the questions

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
about how we were actually addressing

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
the higher needs, these transformational needs

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
for our key employees in the company.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
These three levels of the hierarchy needs

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
relate to the five levels

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I realized we had no metrics.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So we started asking ourselves:

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
What kind of less obvious metrics

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
could we use to actually evaluate

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
our employees' sense of meaning,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
For example, we actually started asking our employees,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
do they understand the mission of our company,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and do they feel like they believe in it,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
can they actually influence it,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
We started asking our customers,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
did they feel an emotional connection with us,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
in one of seven different kinds of ways.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Miraculously, as we asked these questions

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
what we found is we created more loyalty.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Our employee turnover dropped

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to one-third of the industry average,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and during that five year dotcom bust,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
we tripled in size.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and asking them how they were getting through that time,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
what they told me over and over again

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
was that they just manage what they can measure.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
What we can measure is that tangible stuff

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
They didn't even see the intangible stuff

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
higher up the pyramid.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So I started asking myself the question:

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So I went out and studied a bunch of things,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and I found a survey that showed

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
that 94 percent

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
of business leaders worldwide

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
things like intellectual property,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So as leaders, we understand

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
that intangibles are important,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So here's another Einstein quote:

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
"Not everything that can be counted counts,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and not everything that counts can be counted."

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
I hate to argue with Einstein,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
but if that which is most valuable

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
in our life and our business

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
actually can't be counted or valued,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
aren't we going to spend our lives

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
just mired in measuring the mundane?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
It was that sort of heady question about what counts

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
a place some folks call Shangri-La.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
to becoming a transformational

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
role model for the world.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
I went to Bhutan.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
but this was back in 1972,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
when he ascended to the throne

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
two days after his father passed away.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
On a trip through India,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
early in his reign as king,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
he was asked by an Indian journalist

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
about the Bhutanese GDP,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
The king responded in a fashion

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that actually has transformed us four decades later.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and focused with gross domestic product?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Why don't we care more about

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
gross national happiness?"

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
an alternative definition of success,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
what has come to be known as

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
GNH, or gross national happiness.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Most world leaders didn't take notice,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But the king was serious.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
This was a notable moment,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
because this was the first time a world leader

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
in almost 200 years

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
had suggested

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that intangible of happiness --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
that leader 200 years ago,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
200 years later,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
is something that we should measure,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and it's something we should actually value

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
as government officials.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
For the next three dozen years as king,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
this king actually started measuring

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
including, just recently, taking his country

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
with no bloodshed, no coup.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
I got to really understand what they're doing.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
I asked him,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
"How can you create and measure

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
something which evaporates --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
in other words, happiness?"

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And he's a very wise man, and he said,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Wow, that's interesting.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
He said that they have a science behind that art,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and they've actually created four essential pillars,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
nine key indicators

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and 72 different metrics

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that help them to measure their GNH.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
One of those key indicators is:

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
How do the Bhutanese feel about

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
how they spend their time each day?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
It's a good question. How do you feel about

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
how you spend your time each day?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Time is one of the scarcest resources

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
in the modern world.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And yet, of course,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
that little intangible piece of data

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I started to imagine

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
what I call an emotional equation.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And it focuses on something I read long ago

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
How many know him? Anybody?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and he suggested that happiness

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
is not about having what you want;

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
instead, it's about wanting what you have.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
happiness equals wanting what you have --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
imagine gratitude --

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
divided by having what you want --

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
gratification.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
constantly focused on what they don't have.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Their religion, their isolation,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
their deep respect for their culture

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and now the principles of their GNH movement

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
all have fostered a sense of gratitude

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
about what they do have.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
spend more of our time

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
We are a bottom-heavy culture

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
in more ways than one.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
(Laughter)

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
The reality is, in Western countries,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
many dictionaries define pursuit

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
as to "chase with hostility."

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Good question. But back to Bhutan.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Bhutan's bordered on its north and south

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
by 38 percent of the world's population.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Could this little country,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
like a startup in a mature industry,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
be the spark plug that influences

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
a 21st century

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
of middle-class in China and India?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
a new global currency of well-being,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and there are 40 countries around the world today

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
that are studying their own GNH.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
You may have heard, this last fall

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Nicolas Sarkozy in France

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
announcing the results of an 18-month study

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
by two Nobel economists,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Sarkozy suggested that

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
world leaders should stop

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
myopically focusing on GDP

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and consider a new index,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
I like it.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Co-branding opportunities.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
when he suggested that we're

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
myopically focused on the wrong thing

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
This is a collection of things

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
GDP counts everything from air pollution

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
to the destruction of our redwoods.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But it doesn't count the health of our children

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
or the integrity of our public officials.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
As you look at these two columns here,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to start figuring out a new way to count,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
a new way to imagine

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
what's important to us in life?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
(Applause)

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
He said GDP "measures everything in short,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
except that which makes life worthwhile."

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Wow.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
So how do we do that?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Let me say one thing we can just start doing

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
ten years from now, at least in this country.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Why in the heck in America

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
are we doing a census in 2010?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
But all of those questions are tangible.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
They're about demographics.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
and whether you own your home or not.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
That's about it.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
We're not asking meaningful metrics.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
We're not asking important questions.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
We're not asking anything that's intangible.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Abe Maslow said long ago

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
everything starts to look like a nail."

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
We've been fooled by our tool.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Excuse that expression.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
(Laughter)

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
We've been fooled by our tool.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
GDP has been our hammer.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
industrial-era model of success.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
And yet, 64 percent

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
of the world's GDP today

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
is in that intangible industry we call service,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
the service industry, the industry I'm in.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
of manufacturing and agriculture.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
but actually counts what we most value,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
the things that are intangible.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
I learned that economists measure everything

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
in tangible units of production and consumption

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
as if each of those tangible units

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
is exactly the same.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
They aren't the same.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
is that we can influence

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
the quality of that unit of production

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
by creating the conditions

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
for our employees to live their calling.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
In Vivian's case,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
her unit of production

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
isn't the tangible hours she works,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
it's the intangible difference she makes

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
during that one hour of work.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
He stayed there a hundred times

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
in the last 20 years,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
He tells me that he can always count

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
on Vivian and the staff there

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
to make him feel at home.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
Why is it that

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
business leaders and investors

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
quite often don't see the connection

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
between creating the intangible

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
of employee happiness

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
with creating the tangible

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
of financial profits in their business?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
We don't have to choose between

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
inspired employees and sizable profits,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
we can have both.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
In fact, inspired employees quite often

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
help make sizable profits, right?

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
So what the world needs now,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
in my opinion,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
is business leaders and political leaders

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
who know what to count.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
We count numbers.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
We count on people.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
to truly take into account our people.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
I learned that from a maid in a motel

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
and a king of a country.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
What can you

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
start counting today?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
What one thing can you start counting today

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that actually would be meaningful in your life,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
whether it's your work life or your business life?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:31.260
(Applause)
