00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.603
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:19.077
You live on a small farm
in the Philippines.

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:22.760
Your animals are your family's
sole source of income --

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:24.685
as long as they're healthy.

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.079
You know that any day,

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:28.323
one of your pigs can catch the flu,

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:29.694
the swine flu.

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:32.989
Living in tight quarters,
one pig coughing and sneezing

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:35.953
may soon lead to the next pig
coughing and sneezing,

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:39.352
until an outbreak of swine flu
has taken over your farm.

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:41.530
If it's a bad enough virus,

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:44.726
the health of your herd may be gone
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:46.900
If you called in a veterinarian,

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.407
he or she would visit your farm
and take samples

00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:51.255
from your pigs' noses and mouths.

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.106
But then they would have to drive
back into the city

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.929
to test those samples
in their central lab.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.159
Two weeks later,
you'd hear back the results.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.687
Two weeks may be just enough time
for infection to spread

00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.799
and take away your way of life.

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:09.387
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.668
Today, farmers can take
those samples themselves.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:16.439
They can jump right into the pen
and swab their pigs' noses and mouths

00:01:16.463 --> 00:01:18.264
with a little filter paper,

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:21.501
place that little filter paper
in a tiny tube,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:25.406
and mix it with some chemicals
that will extract genetic material

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.343
from their pigs' noses and mouths.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:29.292
And without leaving their farms,

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.614
they take a drop of that genetic material

00:01:31.638 --> 00:01:35.429
and put it into a little analyzer
smaller than a shoebox,

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:40.473
program it to detect DNA or RNA
from the swine flu virus,

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:44.655
and within one hour get back the results,
visualize the results.

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:47.203
This reality is possible

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:51.148
because today we're living in the era
of personal DNA technology.

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:54.874
Every one of us can actually
test DNA ourselves.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:59.187
DNA is the fundamental molecule
the carries genetic instructions

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:01.251
that help build the living world.

00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:03.306
Humans have DNA.

00:02:03.814 --> 00:02:05.386
Pigs have DNA.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.904
Even bacteria and some
viruses have DNA too.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:13.152
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
inform how our bodies develop,

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:14.884
grow, function.

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:18.525
And in many cases, that same information
can trigger disease.

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:20.686
Your genetic information

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.400
is strung into a long and twisted
molecule, the DNA double helix,

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:26.872
that has over three billion letters,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.460
beginning to end.

00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:31.704
But the lines that carry
meaningful information

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.293
are usually very short --

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:36.339
a few dozen to several
thousand letters long.

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:39.510
So when we're looking to answer
a question based on DNA,

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.467
we actually don't need to read

00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:43.960
all those three billion
letters, typically.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:46.221
That would be like getting hungry at night

00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:48.635
and having to flip through
the whole phone book

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.914
from cover to cover,

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:51.513
pausing at every line,

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.522
just to find the nearest pizza joint.

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:54.698
(Laughter)

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:57.259
Luckily, three decades ago,

00:02:57.283 --> 00:02:59.211
humans started to invent tools

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:02.742
that can find any specific line
of genetic information.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.955
These DNA machines are wonderful.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.708
They can find any line in DNA.

00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:09.036
But once they find it,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.511
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
by so much other DNA,

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:19.177
that what these machines then do
is copy the target gene,

00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:21.442
and one copy piles on top of another,

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.631
millions and millions
and millions of copies,

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.641
until that gene stands out
against the rest;

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.848
until we can visualize it,

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:31.415
interpret it, read it, understand it,

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.717
until we can answer:

00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:34.848
Does my pig have the flu?

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:39.411
Or other questions buried in our own DNA:

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.347
Am I at risk of cancer?

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:44.204
Am I of Irish descent?

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.813
Is that child my son?

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:49.846
(Laughter)

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:55.211
This ability to make copies of DNA,
as simple as it sounds,

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.526
has transformed our world.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.562
Scientists use it every day
to detect and address disease,

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:04.074
to create innovative medicines,

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:06.134
to modify foods,

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:08.134
to assess whether our food is safe to eat

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:11.554
or whether it's contaminated
with deadly bacteria.

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:14.422
Even judges use the output
of these machines in court

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:19.020
to decide whether someone is innocent
or guilty based on DNA evidence.

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.457
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique

00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.285
was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1993.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:26.983
But for 30 years,

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.840
the power of genetic analysis
has been confined to the ivory tower,

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:33.704
or bigwig PhD scientist work.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.435
Well, several companies around the world

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.307
are working on making
this same technology accessible

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.362
to everyday people like the pig farmer,

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:44.735
like you.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.343
I cofounded one of these companies.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:48.518
Three years ago,

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:51.529
together with a fellow biologist
and friend of mine,

00:04:51.553 --> 00:04:53.133
Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.772
we decided to make personal DNA machines

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.513
that anyone could use.

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:01.535
Our goal was to bring DNA science
to more people in new places.

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:04.053
We started working in our basements.

00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:06.130
We had a simple question:

00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:07.905
What could the world look like

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.356
if everyone could analyze DNA?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.642
We were curious,

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:17.068
as curious as you would have been
if I had shown you this picture in 1980.

00:05:17.092 --> 00:05:18.377
(Laughter)

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.192
You would have thought, "Wow!

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:22.819
I can now call
my Aunt Glenda from the car

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:24.729
and wish her a happy birthday.

00:05:24.753 --> 00:05:26.728
I can call anyone, anytime.

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:28.675
This is the future!"

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.257
Little did you know,

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:33.886
you would tap on that phone
to make dinner reservations

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.334
for you and Aunt Glenda
to celebrate together.

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:38.888
With another tap,
you'd be ordering her gift.

00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:40.394
And yet one more tap,

00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:42.730
and you'd be "liking"
Auntie Glenda on Facebook.

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:45.098
And all of this,
while sitting on the toilet.

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:47.296
(Laughter)

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.583
It is notoriously hard to predict
where new technology might take us.

00:05:52.607 --> 00:05:57.016
And the same is true
for personal DNA technology today.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.109
For example, I could never have imagined

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.654
that a truffle farmer, of all people,

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:04.767
would use personal DNA machines.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:08.558
Dr. Paul Thomas grows
truffles for a living.

00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:10.289
We see him pictured here,

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:15.409
holding the first UK-cultivated truffle
in his hands, on one of his farms.

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:17.675
Truffles are this delicacy

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.762
that stems from a fungus
growing on the roots of living trees.

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.413
And it's a rare fungus.

00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:28.749
Some species may fetch 3,000,
7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:31.361
I learned from Paul

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.272
that the stakes for a truffle farmer
can be really high.

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:37.510
When he sources new truffles
to grow on his farms,

00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:40.062
he's exposed to the threat
of knockoffs --

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:43.542
truffles that look and feel
like the real thing,

00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:45.068
but they're of lower quality.

00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:47.521
But even to a trained eye like Paul's,

00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:49.627
even when looked at under a microscope,

00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:51.802
these truffles can pass for authentic.

00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:55.752
So in order to grow
the highest quality truffles,

00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:59.015
the ones that chefs
all over the world will fight over,

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.899
Paul has to use DNA analysis.

00:07:02.594 --> 00:07:04.340
Isn't that mind-blowing?

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:07.664
I bet you will never look
at that black truffle risotto again

00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.358
without thinking of its genes.

00:07:09.382 --> 00:07:10.932
(Laughter)

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.815
But personal DNA machines
can also save human lives.

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:21.565
Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist
at the University of Cambridge.

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:23.910
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.

00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:28.189
When the Ebola outbreak
broke out in Western Africa,

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:32.025
he quickly realized that doctors there
lacked the basic tools

00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:33.707
to detect and combat disease.

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.250
Results could take
up to a week to come back --

00:07:37.274 --> 00:07:42.133
that's way too long for the patients
and the families who are suffering.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:46.651
Ian decided to move his lab
into Makeni, Sierra Leone.

00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:49.319
Here we see Ian Goodfellow

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:53.411
moving over 10 tons of equipment
into a pop-up tent

00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:57.111
that he would equip to detect
and diagnose the virus

00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:59.861
and sequence it within 24 hours.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.029
But here's a surprise:

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:06.175
the same equipment that Ian could use
at his lab in the UK

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:08.790
to sequence and diagnose Ebola,

00:08:08.814 --> 00:08:10.947
just wouldn't work under these conditions.

00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:15.705
We're talking 35 Celsius heat
and over 90 percent humidity here.

00:08:16.153 --> 00:08:19.037
But instead, Ian could use
personal DNA machines

00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:22.411
small enough to be placed
in front of the air-conditioning unit

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.366
to keep sequencing the virus

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.965
and keep saving lives.

00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:29.026
This may seem like
an extreme place for DNA analysis,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.826
but let's move on to an even
more extreme environment:

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.165
outer space.

00:08:34.633 --> 00:08:36.935
Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.777
When astronauts live aboard
the International Space Station,

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.424
they're orbiting the planet
250 miles high.

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:47.250
They're traveling
at 17,000 miles per hour.

00:08:47.274 --> 00:08:48.432
Picture that --

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:52.331
you're seeing 15 sunsets
and sunrises every day.

00:08:52.817 --> 00:08:54.689
You're also living in microgravity,

00:08:54.713 --> 00:08:55.881
floating.

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:59.067
And under these conditions,
our bodies can do funky things.

00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:03.833
One of these things is that
our immune systems get suppressed,

00:09:03.857 --> 00:09:06.452
making astronauts more prone to infection.

00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:09.769
A 16-year-old girl,

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:13.624
a high school student from New York,
Anna-Sophia Boguraev,

00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:16.517
wondered whether changes
to the DNA of astronauts

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.964
could be related
to this immune suppression,

00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:22.357
and through a science competition
called "Genes In Space,"

00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:26.288
Anna-Sophia designed an experiment
to test this hypothesis

00:09:26.312 --> 00:09:30.468
using a personal DNA machine
aboard the International Space Station.

00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:37.162
Here we see Anna-Sophia
on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:41.249
watching her experiment launch
to the International Space Station.

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.804
That cloud of smoke is the rocket

00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:48.523
that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment
to the International Space Station,

00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:50.476
where, three days later,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.248
astronaut Tim Peake
carried out her experiment --

00:09:54.272 --> 00:09:55.494
in microgravity.

00:09:56.175 --> 00:09:59.931
Personal DNA machines are now
aboard the International Space Station,

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:02.542
where they can help monitor
living conditions

00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:04.660
and protect the lives of astronauts.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:09.779
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment

00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:11.716
to protect the lives of astronauts

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.302
may seem like a rarity,
the mark of a child genius.

00:10:15.784 --> 00:10:18.354
Well, to me, it signals
something bigger:

00:10:18.378 --> 00:10:23.531
that DNA technology is finally
within the reach of every one of you.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.706
A few years ago,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.913
a college student armed
with a personal computer

00:10:29.937 --> 00:10:31.088
could code an app,

00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:35.488
an app that is now a social network
with more than one billion users.

00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.893
Could we be moving into a world

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:41.188
of one personal DNA machine in every home?

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:45.347
I know families who are already
living in this reality.

00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:47.665
The Daniels family, for example,

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:52.535
set up a DNA lab in the basement
of their suburban Chicago home.

00:10:52.904 --> 00:10:56.107
This is not a family
made of PhD scientists.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.766
This is a family like any other.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.845
They just like to spend time together
doing fun, creative things.

00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:06.732
By day, Brian is an executive
at a private equity firm.

00:11:07.137 --> 00:11:10.042
At night and on weekends,
he experiments with DNA

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:12.963
alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,

00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:15.091
as a way to explore the living world.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.154
Last time I called them,

00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:21.066
they were checking out homegrown produce
from the backyard garden.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.387
They were testing tomatoes
that they had picked,

00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:26.191
taking the flesh of their skin,
putting it in a test tube,

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.297
mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:31.799
and then using their home DNA copier

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:35.746
to test those tomatoes
for genetically engineered traits.

00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:38.410
For the Daniels family,

00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:41.333
the personal DNA machine
is like the chemistry set

00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:42.684
for the 21st century.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:47.237
Most of us may not yet
be diagnosing genetic conditions

00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:48.607
in our kitchen sinks

00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:51.341
or doing at-home paternity testing.

00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:52.390
(Laughter)

00:11:52.414 --> 00:11:54.634
But we've definitely reached
a point in history

00:11:54.658 --> 00:12:00.467
where every one of you could actually
get hands-on with DNA

00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.922
in your kitchen.

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:05.133
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.688
and extract meaningful
information from it.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.251
And it's at times like this
that profound transformation

00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:12.874
is bound to happen;

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:16.150
moments when a transformative,
powerful technology

00:12:16.174 --> 00:12:19.796
that was before limited
to a select few in the ivory tower,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.293
finally becomes within the reach
of every one of us,

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.142
from farmers to schoolchildren.

00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:27.939
Think about the moment

00:12:27.963 --> 00:12:31.840
when phones stopped being
plugged into the wall by cords,

00:12:31.864 --> 00:12:34.159
or when computers left the mainframe

00:12:34.183 --> 00:12:36.796
and entered your home or your office.

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:40.397
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.948
may be hard to predict,

00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:43.589
but one thing is certain:

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:46.005
revolutions don't go backwards,

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:50.294
and DNA technology is already spreading
faster than our imagination.

00:12:50.318 --> 00:12:52.217
So if you're curious,

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.456
get up close and personal
with DNA -- today.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.071
It is in our DNA to be curious.

00:12:58.095 --> 00:12:59.110
(Laughter)

00:12:59.134 --> 00:13:00.294
Thank you.

00:13:00.318 --> 00:13:03.632
(Applause)
