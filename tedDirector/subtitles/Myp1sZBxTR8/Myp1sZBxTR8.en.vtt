00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.470
Two years ago, I was invited as an artist

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.330
to participate in an exhibition commemorating

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.988
100 years of Islamic art in Europe.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.428
The curator had only one condition:

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:26.918
I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.

00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:30.029
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.671
or a human being living in the world in 2010,

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:36.636
I only had one thing to say:

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.446
I wanted to say no.

00:00:39.446 --> 00:00:41.662
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no,

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.982
and a thousand times no."

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:47.778
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:49.624
on everything ever produced

00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:54.305
under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years,

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:58.186
from Spain to the borders of China.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.185
I collected my findings in a book,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.629
placed them chronologically, stating the name,

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.099
the patron, the medium and the date.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.298
Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation,

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:13.905
which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany,

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:17.419
in September of 2010.

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:23.323
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started,

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.146
and life stopped for 18 days,

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:27.605
and on the 12th of February,

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.593
we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo,

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:34.626
believing that the revolution had succeeded.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.282
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:42.482
in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:46.241
was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:49.137
I did not feel that I could live in a city

00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:51.144
where people were being killed

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.112
and thrown like garbage on the street.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:56.438
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from

00:01:56.438 --> 00:02:00.023
the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it:

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.690
"no to military rule."

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.706
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:07.737
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:10.706
like ammunition, and adding messages to them,

00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:13.106
and I started spraying them on the walls.

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:15.812
So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:18.410
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.316
should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:26.462
No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.330
on the second day of the revolution,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.790
and he sat there with this guitar, singing.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.079
One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.105
No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:42.856
on the 28th of January,

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:46.202
and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November,

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:49.688
by two different snipers.

00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:53.013
No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion,

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:56.199
because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.561
on December 16th, during a demonstration,

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.421
leaving behind three orphans and a widow.

00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:06.704
No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:10.924
on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.313
No to stripping the people,

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:16.807
and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:20.757
as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:24.758
and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:26.910
"Long live a peaceful revolution,"

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.430
because we will never retaliate with violence.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.845
No to barrier walls. On February 5th,

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:38.038
concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:43.719
to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.164
Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story

00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:48.966
of one wall in Cairo.

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:53.273
A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank

00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:55.115
on a wall. It's one to one.

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:58.979
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.093
with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby,

00:04:02.093 --> 00:04:04.947
there's no problem with this visual.

00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:08.861
After acts of violence, another artist came,

00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:13.334
painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank,

00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:16.380
demonstrators, and a message that read,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.727
"Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face,

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:23.446
the face of every martyr. I exist."

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:26.347
Authority comes, paints the wall white,

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:28.989
leaves the tank and adds a message:

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:34.018
"Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."

00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:37.653
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military

00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:41.015
as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:43.707
in front of the tank.

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:47.708
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank,

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:50.336
leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:51.943
just to hide the face of the monster.

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:55.836
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit,

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:58.261
on the tank, and on the whole wall,

00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:00.335
and this is how it stands today

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:02.114
until further notice. (Laughter)

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:06.380
Now, I want to leave you with a final no.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.995
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper

00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:15.224
in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of

00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:17.538
Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.

00:05:17.538 --> 00:05:19.323
The message reads,

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:25.732
[Arabic]

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:29.409
"You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.264
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:42.285
(Applause)

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:48.047
Thank you. Shukran. (Applause)
