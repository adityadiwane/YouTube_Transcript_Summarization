00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.816
In India, we have these huge families.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.416
I bet a lot of you all
must have heard about it.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.280
Which means that there are
a lot of family events.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.720
So as a child, my parents
used to drag me to these family events.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.376
But the one thing
that I always looked forward to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.440
was playing around with my cousins.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.456
And there was always this one uncle

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.736
who used to be there,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.616
always ready, jumping around with us,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.136
having games for us,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.960
making us kids have the time of our lives.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.256
This man was extremely successful:

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.280
he was confident and powerful.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.320
But then I saw this hale and hearty person
deteriorate in health.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.520
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.816
Parkinson's is a disease that causes
degeneration of the nervous system,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.816
which means that this person
who used to be independent

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.080
suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,
because of tremors, much more difficult.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.456
My uncle started using a walker to walk,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.696
and to take a turn,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.776
he literally had to take
one step at a time, like this,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.040
and it took forever.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.416
So this person, who used to be
the center of attention

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.496
in every family gathering,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.600
was suddenly hiding behind people.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.760
He was hiding from the pitiful look
in people's eyes.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.520
And he's not the only one in the world.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.776
Every year, 60,000 people
are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.840
and this number is only rising.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.776
As designers, we dream that our designs
solve these multifaceted problems,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.616
one solution that solves it all,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.920
but it need not always be like that.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.496
You can also target simple problems

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.440
and create small solutions for them
and eventually make a big impact.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.496
So my aim here was
to not cure Parkinson's,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.696
but to make their everyday tasks
much more simple,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.120
and then make an impact.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.600
Well, the first thing I targeted
was tremors, right?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.976
My uncle told me that he had stopped
drinking coffee or tea in public

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.479
just out of embarrassment,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.480
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.936
It works just purely on its form.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.216
The curve on top deflects the liquid
back inside every time they have tremors,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.080
and this keeps the liquid inside
compared to a normal cup.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.720
But the key here is that it is not tagged
as a Parkinson's patient product.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.456
It looks like a cup that could be used
by you, me, any clumsy person,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.480
and that makes it much more comforting
for them to use, to blend in.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.576
So, well, one problem solved,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.840
many more to go.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.056
All this while, I was interviewing him,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.616
questioning him,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.336
and then I realized that I was getting
very superficial information,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.176
or just answers to my questions.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.360
But I really needed to dig deeper
to get a new perspective.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.736
So I thought, well,
let's observe him in his daily tasks,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.120
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.856
And then, when I was actually
observing him walking to his dining table,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.056
it struck me, this man who finds it
so difficult to walk on flat land,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.800
how does he climb a staircase?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.016
Because in India we do not have
a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.056
like in the developed countries.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.200
One actually has to climb the stairs.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.176
So he told me,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.200
"Well, let me show you how I do it."

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.920
Let's take a look at what I saw.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.616
So he took really long
to reach this position,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.496
and then all this while, I'm thinking,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.456
"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.376
Is he really, really going to do it
without his walker?"

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.600
And then ...

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.600
(Laughter)

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.840
And the turns, he took them so easily.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.480
So -- shocked?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.400
Well, I was too.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.296
So this person who could not
walk on flat land

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.400
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.375
On researching this, I realized that
it's because it's a continuous motion.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.536
There's this other man
who also suffers from the same symptoms

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.976
and uses a walker,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.096
but the moment he's put on a cycle,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.816
all his symptoms vanish,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.920
because it is a continuous motion.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.856
So the key for me was to translate
this feeling of walking on a staircase

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.280
back to flat land.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.816
And a lot of ideas
were tested and tried on him,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.360
but the one that finally worked
was this one. Let's take a look.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.496
(Laughter)

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.976
(Applause)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.456
He walked faster, right?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.680
(Applause)

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.016
I call this the staircase illusion,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.616
and actually when the staircase illusion
abruptly ended, he froze,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.656
and this is called freezing of gait.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.896
So it happens a lot,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.856
so why not have a staircase illusion
flowing through all their rooms,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.240
making them feel much more confident?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.096
You know, technology is not always it.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.896
What we need are human-centered solutions.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.136
I could have easily
made it into a projection,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.496
or a Google Glass, or something like that.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.840
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.296
This print could be taken into hospitals

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720
to make them feel much more welcome.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.696
What I wish to do
is make every Parkinson's patient

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.176
feel like my uncle felt that day.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.880
He told me that I made him feel
like his old self again.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120
"Smart" in today's world
has become synonymous to high tech,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.120
and the world is only getting
smarter and smarter day by day.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.480
But why can't smart be something
that's simple and yet effective?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.296
All we need is a little bit of empathy
and some curiosity,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.576
to go out there, observe.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.496
But let's not stop at that.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.176
Let's find these complex problems.
Don't be scared of them.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.776
Break them, boil them down
into much smaller problems,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.296
and then find simple solutions for them.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.336
Test these solutions, fail if needed,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.520
but with newer insights to make it better.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.496
Imagine what we all could do
if we all came up with simple solutions.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.000
What would the world be like
if we combined all our simple solutions?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.896
Let's make a smarter world,
but with simplicity.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.136
Thank you.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.200
(Applause)
