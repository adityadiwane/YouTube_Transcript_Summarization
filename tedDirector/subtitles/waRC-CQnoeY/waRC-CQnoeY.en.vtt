00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.376
So earlier this year,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.216
I was informed that I would be
doing a TED Talk.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.216
So I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.256
then I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.816
and in between the excitement
and the panicking,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.136
I started to do my research,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.616
and my research primarily consisted
of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.856
(Laughter)

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.536
And interspersed with that,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.256
I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.896
How many of you know who that is?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.696
(Cheers)

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.055
So I was Googling her
because I always Google her

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.336
because I'm just a fan,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.976
but also because she always has
important and interesting things to say.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.456
And the combination of those searches

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.096
kept leading me to her talk

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.296
on the dangers of a single story,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.696
on what happens
when we have a solitary lens

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.216
through which to understand
certain groups of people,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.200
and it is the perfect talk.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.056
It's the talk that I would have given
if I had been famous first.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.256
(Laughter)

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.656
You know, and you know,
like, she's African and I'm African,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.616
and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.816
and she's a storyteller
and I'm a storyteller,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.656
so I really felt like it's my talk.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.416
(Laughter)

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.736
So I decided that I was going
to learn how to code,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.776
and then I was going to hack the internet

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.536
and I would take down all the copies
of that talk that existed,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.976
and then I would memorize it,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.256
and then I would come here
and deliver it as if it was my own speech.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.456
So that plan was going really well,
except the coding part,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.376
and then one morning a few months ago,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.976
I woke up

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.456
to the news that the wife
of a certain presidential candidate

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.456
had given a speech that --

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.416
(Laughter)

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.000
(Applause)

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.576
that sounded eerily like a speech
given by one of my other faves,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.816
Michelle Obama.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.936
(Cheers)

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.976
And so I decided that I should
probably write my own TED Talk,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.496
and so that is what I am here to do.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.840
I'm here to talk about
my own observations about storytelling.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.616
I want to talk to you
about the power of stories, of course,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.576
but I also want to talk
about their limitations,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.640
particularly for those of us
who are interested in social justice.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.176
So since Adichie gave that talk
seven years ago,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.456
there has been a boom in storytelling.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.216
Stories are everywhere,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.176
and if there was a danger
in the telling of one tired old tale,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.536
then I think there has got to be
lots to celebrate about the flourishing

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.336
of so many stories and so many voices.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.160
Stories are the antidote to bias.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.016
In fact, today, if you are middle class
and connected via the internet,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.176
you can download stories
at the touch of a button

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.576
or the swipe of a screen.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.416
You can listen to a podcast

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.336
about what it's like
to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.856
You can hear an indigenous
man in Australia

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.976
talk about the trials and triumphs
of raising his children in dignity

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.336
and in pride.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.336
Stories make us fall in love.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.536
They heal rifts and they bridge divides.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.416
Stories can even make it easier for us

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.096
to talk about the deaths
of people in our societies

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.576
who don't matter,
because they make us care.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800
Right?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.056
I'm not so sure,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.160
and I actually work for a place
called the Centre for Stories.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.256
And my job is to help to tell stories

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.816
that challenge mainstream narratives
about what it means to be black

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.896
or a Muslim or a refugee
or any of those other categories

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.936
that we talk about all the time.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.176
But I come to this work

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.696
after a long history
as a social justice activist,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.856
and so I'm really interested in the ways

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.576
that people talk
about nonfiction storytelling

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.936
as though it's about
more than entertainment,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.920
as though it's about being
a catalyst for social action.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.216
It's not uncommon to hear people say

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.240
that stories make
the world a better place.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.176
Increasingly, though, I worry
that even the most poignant stories,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.136
particularly the stories about people
who no one seems to care about,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.576
can often get in the way
of action towards social justice.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.416
Now, this is not because
storytellers mean any harm.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.696
Quite the contrary.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.960
Storytellers are often do-gooders
like me and, I suspect, yourselves.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.656
And the audiences of storytellers

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.920
are often deeply compassionate
and empathetic people.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.176
Still, good intentions
can have unintended consequences,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.240
and so I want to propose that stories
are not as magical as they seem.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.576
So three -- because
it's always got to be three --

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.816
three reasons why I think

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.520
that stories don't necessarily
make the world a better place.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.376
Firstly, stories can create
an illusion of solidarity.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.936
There is nothing
like that feel-good factor you get

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.096
from listening to a fantastic story

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.496
where you feel like you
climbed that mountain, right,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.360
or that you befriended
that death row inmate.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.256
But you didn't.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.096
You haven't done anything.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.896
Listening is an important

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.880
but insufficient step
towards social action.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.976
Secondly, I think often we are drawn

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.936
towards characters and protagonists

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.416
who are likable and human.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.336
And this makes sense, of course, right?

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.416
Because if you like someone,
then you care about them.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.840
But the inverse is also true.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.176
If you don't like someone,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.136
then you don't care about them.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.016
And if you don't care about them,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.936
you don't have to see yourself
as having a moral obligation

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.200
to think about the circumstances
that shaped their lives.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.296
I learned this lesson
when I was 14 years old.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.096
I learned that actually,
you don't have to like someone

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.496
to recognize their wisdom,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.616
and you certainly
don't have to like someone

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080
to take a stand by their side.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.600
So my bike was stolen

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.976
while I was riding it --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.136
(Laughter)

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.736
which is possible if you're
riding slowly enough, which I was.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.256
(Laughter)

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.256
So one minute
I'm cutting across this field

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.576
in the Nairobi neighborhood
where I grew up,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.056
and it's like a very bumpy path,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.896
and so when you're riding a bike,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.176
you don't want to be like, you know --

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.600
(Laughter)

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.776
And so I'm going like this,
slowly pedaling,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.376
and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.576
I'm on the ground, and I look up,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.376
and there's this kid peddling away
in the getaway vehicle,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.896
which is my bike,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.176
and he's about 11 or 12 years old,
and I'm on the floor,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.056
and I'm crying because I saved
a lot of money for that bike,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.656
and I'm crying and I stand up
and I start screaming.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.936
Instinct steps in,
and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!"

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.600
which means "thief" in Swahili.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.576
And out of the woodworks,
all of these people come out

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.016
and they start to give chase.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.296
This is Africa, so mob justice in action.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.776
Right?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.576
And I round the corner,
and they've captured him,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.056
they've caught him.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.136
The suspect has been apprehended,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.736
and they make him give me my bike back,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.376
and they also make him apologize.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.976
Again, you know,
typical African justice, right?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.496
And so they make him say sorry.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.856
And so we stand there facing each other,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.816
and he looks at me, and he says sorry,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.336
but he looks at me
with this unbridled fury.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.400
He is very, very angry.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.496
And it is the first time that I have been
confronted with someone

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.136
who doesn't like me
simply because of what I represent.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.216
He looks at me
with this look as if to say,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.120
"You, with your shiny skin
and your bike, you're angry at me?"

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.496
So it was a hard lesson
that he didn't like me,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.576
but you know what, he was right.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.096
I was a middle-class kid
living in a poor country.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.360
I had a bike, and he barely had food.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.696
Sometimes, it's the messages
that we don't want to hear,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.216
the ones that make us
want to crawl out of ourselves,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.816
that we need to hear the most.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.016
For every lovable storyteller
who steals your heart,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.416
there are hundreds more
whose voices are slurred and ragged,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.120
who don't get to stand up on a stage
dressed in fine clothes like this.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.936
There are a million
angry-boy-on-a-bike stories

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.616
and we can't afford to ignore them

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.776
simply because we don't like
their protagonists

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.736
or because that's not the kid
that we would bring home with us

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.960
from the orphanage.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.456
The third reason that I think

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.096
that stories don't necessarily
make the world a better place

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.576
is that too often we are so invested
in the personal narrative

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.440
that we forget
to look at the bigger picture.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.776
And so we applaud someone

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.456
when they tell us
about their feelings of shame,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.640
but we don't necessarily
link that to oppression.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.736
We nod understandingly
when someone says they felt small,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.800
but we don't link that to discrimination.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.416
The most important stories,
especially for social justice,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.256
are those that do both,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.040
that are both personal and allow us
to explore and understand the political.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.936
But it's not just
about the stories we like

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.856
versus the stories we choose to ignore.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.816
Increasingly, we are living in a society
where there are larger forces at play,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.200
where stories are actually for many people
beginning to replace the news.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.856
Yeah?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.256
We live in a time where we are witnessing
the decline of facts,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.496
when emotions rule

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.616
and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.840
Where we value what we feel
more than what we actually know.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.336
A recent report by the Pew Center
on trends in America

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.136
indicates that only 10 percent
of young adults under the age of 30

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.536
"place a lot of trust in the media."

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.360
Now, this is significant.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.456
It means that storytellers
are gaining trust

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.856
at precisely the same moment

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.200
that many in the media
are losing the confidence in the public.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.616
This is not a good thing,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.416
because while stories are important

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.656
and they help us
to have insights in many ways,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.536
we need the media.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.056
From my years
as a social justice activist,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.176
I know very well that we need
credible facts from media institutions

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.216
combined with the powerful voices
of storytellers.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.760
That's what pushes the needle forward
in terms of social justice.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.560
In the final analysis, of course,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.296
it is justice

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.056
that makes the world a better place,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.040
not stories. Right?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.136
And so if it is justice that we are after,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.576
then I think we mustn't focus
on the media or on storytellers.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.296
We must focus on audiences,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.416
on anyone who has ever turned on a radio

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.256
or listened to a podcast,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.376
and that means all of us.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.536
So a few concluding thoughts

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.440
on what audiences can do
to make the world a better place.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.936
So firstly, the world
would be a better place, I think,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.536
if audiences were more curious
and more skeptical

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.176
and asked more questions
about the social context

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.280
that created those stories
that they love so much.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.456
Secondly, the world
would be a better place

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.160
if audiences recognized
that storytelling is intellectual work.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.576
And I think it would
be important for audiences

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.936
to demand more buttons
on their favorite websites,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.656
buttons for example that say,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.296
"If you liked this story,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.376
click here to support a cause
your storyteller believes in."

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.560
Or "click here to contribute
to your storyteller's next big idea."

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.056
Often, we are committed to the platforms,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.536
but not necessarily
to the storytellers themselves.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.656
And then lastly, I think that audiences
can make the world a better place

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.760
by switching off their phones,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.576
by stepping away from their screens

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.080
and stepping out into the real world
beyond what feels safe.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.856
Alice Walker has said,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.656
"Look closely at the present
you are constructing.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.840
It should look like the future
you are dreaming."

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.856
Storytellers can help us to dream,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.680
but it's up to all of us
to have a plan for justice.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.696
Thank you.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.070
