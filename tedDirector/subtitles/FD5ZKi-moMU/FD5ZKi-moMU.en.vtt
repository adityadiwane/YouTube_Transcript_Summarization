00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.540
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.333
because, you see, my father's name was Ted,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.347
and much of my life, especially my musical life,

00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:29.468
is really a talk that I'm still having with him,

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:33.216
or the part of me that he continues to be.

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.820
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.135
and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:42.670
He didn't read a note,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.635
and he was profoundly hearing impaired.

00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:48.893
Yet, he was my greatest teacher.

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:52.330
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.510
his understanding of music was profound.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.891
And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:03.087
as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.704
And he did a painting of this experience,

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.793
which he called "In the Realm of Music."

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:15.281
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising

00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.062
in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.

00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:24.904
(Music)

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:28.258
But he was tough when it came to music.

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:30.964
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music:

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:33.177
what and how.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:36.964
And the thing about classical music,

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.292
that what and how, it's inexhaustible."

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:42.460
That was his passion for the music.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.317
Both my parents really loved it.

00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.575
They didn't know all that much about it,

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.302
but they gave me the opportunity to discover it

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:52.218
together with them.

00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:55.430
And I think inspired by that memory,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.433
it's been my desire to try and bring it

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:58.478
to as many other people as I can,

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:02.052
sort of pass it on through whatever means.

00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:07.062
And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:08.518
really fascinates me.

00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:10.775
One day in New York, I was on the street

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:16.180
and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.881
And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.585
and he took a swing and really connected.

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.287
And he watched the ball fly for a second,

00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:26.691
and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.

00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.177
Brah dada dadadadah."

00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:32.010
And he ran around the bases.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.745
And I thought, go figure.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:39.826
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:44.498
turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.900
How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.821
Well when it comes to classical music,

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.077
there's an awful lot to pass on,

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:56.814
much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:58.426
Because classical music

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:01.843
is an unbroken living tradition

00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:05.093
that goes back over 1,000 years.

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:07.137
And every one of those years

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:10.635
has had something unique and powerful to say to us

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.860
about what it's like to be alive.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.419
Now the raw material of it, of course,

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.135
is just the music of everyday life.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.168
It's all the anthems and dance crazes

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:22.903
and ballads and marches.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.593
But what classical music does

00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:30.453
is to distill all of these musics down,

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:34.139
to condense them to their absolute essence,

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.427
and from that essence create a new language,

00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:42.912
a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:45.012
about who we really are.

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:47.856
It's a language that's still evolving.

00:03:47.856 --> 00:03:51.427
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:54.427
like concertos and symphonies,

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:57.758
but even the most ambitious masterpiece

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:00.177
can have as its central mission

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:04.677
to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment --

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:07.885
like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:30.271
(Music)

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:36.255
It's so simple, so evocative.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.115
So many emotions seem to be inside of it.

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:40.843
Yet, of course, like all music,

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.302
it's essentially not about anything.

00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:47.085
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:51.177
And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:54.130
They're locations in the spectrum of sound.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.231
And whether we call them 440 per second, A,

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:04.949
or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right --

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.045
they're just phenomena.

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:12.802
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena

00:05:12.802 --> 00:05:16.596
is complex and emotional and not totally understood.

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:20.427
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,

00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:22.802
as have our preferences for them.

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:26.093
So for example, in the 11th century,

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:29.933
people liked pieces that ended like this.

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:41.666
(Music)

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:46.822
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.

00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:52.260
(Music)

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.102
And in the 21st century ...

00:05:56.102 --> 00:06:03.510
(Music)

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.829
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:12.302
even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:13.802
or sent some of you running from the room.

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:15.218
And the reason you like it

00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:17.706
is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:20.260
centuries-worth of changes

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.760
in musical theory, practice and fashion.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.850
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.833
because of the music's powerful silent partner,

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:36.462
the way it's been passed on: notation.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.427
Now the impulse to notate,

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:41.218
or, more exactly I should say, encode music

00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:44.276
has been with us for a very long time.

00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:48.177
In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos

00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:51.127
wrote this song for his departed wife

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:52.718
and inscribed it on her gravestone

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:55.343
in the notational system of the Greeks.

00:06:55.343 --> 00:07:22.718
(Music)

00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:25.135
And a thousand years later,

00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:29.145
this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:30.510
And you can see how this happened

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:37.093
in these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,"

00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:39.468
"For Us is Born."

00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:44.101
(Music)

00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:46.343
In the 10th century, little squiggles were used

00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:49.385
just to indicate the general shape of the tune.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:56.427
And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,

00:07:56.427 --> 00:08:00.005
to better pinpoint the pitch's location.

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:08.335
And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.968
locked in the concept of the tune exactly,

00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:14.635
and that led to the kind of notation we have today.

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:18.306
Well notation not only passed the music on,

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:22.987
notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,

00:08:22.987 --> 00:08:24.943
because it enabled the musicians

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:28.599
to imagine music on a much vaster scale.

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:31.927
Now inspired moves of improvisation

00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:35.927
could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,

00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:38.468
made into intricate designs.

00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:41.708
And from this moment, classical music became

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.302
what it most essentially is,

00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:49.343
a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:

00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:51.718
instinct and intelligence.

00:08:51.718 --> 00:08:55.093
And there began to be a real difference at this point

00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:58.010
between the art of improvisation

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.418
and the art of composition.

00:08:59.418 --> 00:09:03.935
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,

00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:07.552
but a composer is considering all possible moves,

00:09:07.552 --> 00:09:10.871
testing them out, prioritizing them out,

00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:15.343
until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design

00:09:15.343 --> 00:09:19.750
of ultimate and enduring coolness.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.302
Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,

00:09:21.302 --> 00:09:23.531
were combinations of these two things.

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:27.816
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.

00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:29.760
Mozart was the same way.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.006
But every musician strikes a different balance

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:36.802
between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:41.710
And every musical era had different priorities of these things,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.677
different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.

00:09:45.677 --> 00:09:50.245
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition

00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:53.093
the big 'what' was to praise God.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.718
And by the 1400s, music was being written

00:09:55.718 --> 00:09:59.802
that tried to mirror God's mind

00:09:59.802 --> 00:10:03.718
as could be seen in the design of the night sky.

00:10:03.718 --> 00:10:07.010
The 'how' was a style called polyphony,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.760
music of many independently moving voices

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.468
that suggested the way the planets seemed to move

00:10:13.468 --> 00:10:16.097
in Ptolemy's geocentric universe.

00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:19.883
This was truly the music of the spheres.

00:10:19.883 --> 00:10:49.177
(Music)

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:54.427
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.

00:10:54.427 --> 00:10:58.025
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:00.885
meant that something new had to happen --

00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:05.010
a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:11.843
(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:16.635
Ah, wicked, cruel fate!

00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:23.552
Ah, baleful stars!

00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:30.510
Ah, avaricious heaven!

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.218
MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,

00:11:34.218 --> 00:11:36.830
and its development put music on a radical new course.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.170
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,

00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:44.135
but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.

00:11:44.135 --> 00:11:47.427
And the how was harmony,

00:11:47.427 --> 00:11:50.718
stacking up the pitches to form chords.

00:11:50.718 --> 00:11:52.468
And the chords, it turned out,

00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:56.552
were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.

00:11:56.552 --> 00:12:01.351
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,

00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:02.612
the triads,

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:05.871
either the major one,

00:12:05.871 --> 00:12:10.479
which we think is happy,

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.824
or the minor one,

00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:17.760
which we perceive as sad.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.029
But what's the actual difference between these two chords?

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.266
It's just these two notes in the middle.

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:26.231
It's either E natural,

00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:30.931
and 659 vibrations per second,

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:35.635
or E flat, at 622.

00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:41.260
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.010
37 freakin' vibrations.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.927
So you can see in a system like this

00:12:47.927 --> 00:12:49.956
there was enormous subtle potential

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:51.831
of representing human emotions.

00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:55.564
And in fact, as man began to understand more

00:12:55.564 --> 00:12:57.727
his complex and ambivalent nature,

00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:00.385
harmony grew more complex to reflect it.

00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:04.444
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions

00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:06.177
beyond the ability of words.

00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:09.510
Now with all this possibility,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.593
classical music really took off.

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:16.989
It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.

00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:21.593
And the effects of technology began to be felt also,

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:26.029
because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:28.039
into the hands of performers everywhere.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.260
And new and improved instruments

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.552
made the age of the virtuoso possible.

00:13:33.552 --> 00:13:36.802
This is when those big forms arose --

00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:39.921
the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.

00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:43.927
And in these big architectures of time,

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:49.635
composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.

00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:52.095
A piece like Beethoven's Fifth

00:13:52.095 --> 00:13:56.453
basically witnessing how it was possible

00:13:56.453 --> 00:14:01.970
for him to go from sorrow and anger,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.677
over the course of a half an hour,

00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:09.468
step by exacting step of his route,

00:14:09.468 --> 00:14:13.808
to the moment when he could make it across to joy.

00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:36.302
(Music)

00:14:36.302 --> 00:14:41.343
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,

00:14:41.343 --> 00:14:43.970
like gripping ones of culture,

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.718
such as nationalism or quest for freedom

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:50.589
or the frontiers of sensuality.

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:54.360
But whatever direction the music took,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.898
one thing until recently was always the same,

00:14:56.898 --> 00:14:59.927
and that was when the musicians stopped playing,

00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:02.302
the music stopped.

00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:05.665
Now this moment so fascinates me.

00:15:05.665 --> 00:15:07.576
I find it such a profound one.

00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:08.943
What happens when the music stops?

00:15:08.943 --> 00:15:12.385
Where does it go? What's left?

00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:15.673
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?

00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:17.445
Is it a melody or a rhythm

00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:20.225
or a mood or an attitude?

00:15:20.225 --> 00:15:22.494
And how might that change their lives?

00:15:22.494 --> 00:15:26.427
To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:30.968
It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.

00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:34.226
And to me that's the most essential of all.

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:38.185
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing,

00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:40.792
a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:43.569
and then around 1880 came this new technology

00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:46.260
that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.547
created a new and miraculous way of passing things on,

00:15:50.547 --> 00:15:52.335
albeit an impersonal one.

00:15:52.335 --> 00:15:56.052
People could now hear music all the time,

00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:56.927
even though it wasn't necessary

00:15:56.927 --> 00:16:01.468
for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.

00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:06.772
And technology democratized music by making everything available.

00:16:06.772 --> 00:16:08.533
It spearheaded a cultural revolution

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:13.393
in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.

00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:17.314
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,

00:16:17.314 --> 00:16:19.014
using computers and synthesizers

00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:21.933
to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:26.468
beyond the means of performers and audiences.

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:28.968
At the same time technology,

00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:32.260
by taking over the role that notation had always played,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.802
shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence

00:16:36.802 --> 00:16:40.093
way over to the instinctive side.

00:16:40.093 --> 00:16:41.983
The culture in which we live now

00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:45.052
is awash with music of improvisation

00:16:45.052 --> 00:16:46.677
that's been sliced, diced, layered

00:16:46.677 --> 00:16:50.427
and, God knows, distributed and sold.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:53.714
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:54.721
Nobody knows.

00:16:54.721 --> 00:16:58.443
The question remains: What happens when the music stops?

00:16:58.443 --> 00:17:00.394
What sticks with people?

00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:04.377
Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?

00:17:04.377 --> 00:17:06.797
Well let me show you a story of what I mean

00:17:06.797 --> 00:17:08.589
by "really sticking with us."

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.677
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,

00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:15.012
and I spied a very shaky old man

00:17:15.012 --> 00:17:17.289
making his way across the room on a walker.

00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:19.805
He came over to a piano that was there,

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:24.135
and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.

00:17:24.135 --> 00:17:28.670
(Music)

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:37.533
And he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:39.085
And I suddenly got it,

00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:42.005
and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"

00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:46.956
(Music)

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:49.385
And he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.

00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:53.981
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."

00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:55.664
And I thought, my God,

00:17:55.664 --> 00:17:58.510
how much must this music mean to this man

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.627
that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room

00:18:02.627 --> 00:18:05.927
to recover the memory of this music

00:18:05.927 --> 00:18:08.835
that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,

00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:11.093
still means so much to him?

00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:15.016
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously,

00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:16.766
why it matters to me so much.

00:18:16.766 --> 00:18:20.218
I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it

00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:21.968
and what will happen to it in their life.

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:27.055
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible

00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:28.385
of sharing this music.

00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:30.131
That's what drives my interest in projects

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:33.510
like the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.077
that looks at the backstories of music,

00:18:36.077 --> 00:18:39.254
and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony

00:18:39.254 --> 00:18:40.848
on projects that explore the potential

00:18:40.848 --> 00:18:44.354
of the new performing arts centers

00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:46.728
for both entertainment and education.

00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:48.695
And of course, the New World Symphony

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:52.343
led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet

00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:55.347
that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.

00:18:55.347 --> 00:19:00.127
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.

00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:02.365
There's just a role here for so many people --

00:19:02.381 --> 00:19:05.177
teachers, parents, performers --

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:08.037
to be explorers together.

00:19:08.037 --> 00:19:10.822
Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention,

00:19:10.822 --> 00:19:14.302
but what really matters is what goes on every single day.

00:19:14.302 --> 00:19:18.772
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.

00:19:18.772 --> 00:19:21.862
And it excites me now to meet people

00:19:21.862 --> 00:19:24.960
who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.725
people I never would have guessed who loved the music

00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:28.840
and who are passing it on.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.581
You don't need to worry about knowing anything.

00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:36.343
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.403
you know all that you need to know.

00:19:39.403 --> 00:19:41.612
You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.

00:19:41.612 --> 00:19:45.716
Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.

00:19:45.716 --> 00:19:50.335
All that 'what', all that 'how' is out there

00:19:50.335 --> 00:19:52.798
waiting for you to discover its 'why',

00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:55.887
to dive in and pass it on.

00:19:55.887 --> 00:19:58.385
Thank you.

00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:05.497
(Applause)
