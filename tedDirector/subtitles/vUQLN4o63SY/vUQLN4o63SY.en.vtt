00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.629
This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.189
where I work as a curator.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.237
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:23.213
and that it grows,

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:28.565
and basically it means I collect dead animals.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.956
Back in 1995,

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:35.452
we got a new wing next to the museum.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.593
It was made of glass,

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:43.099
and this building really helped me to do my job good.

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:47.225
The building was a true bird-killer.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.803
You may know that birds don't understand

00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:52.965
the concept of glass. They don't see it,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:56.571
so they fly into the windows and get killed.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:58.811
The only thing I had to do was go out,

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:02.868
pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.986
(Laughter)

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:07.765
And in those days,

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.203
I developed an ear to identify birds

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:16.789
just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.771
And it was on June 5, 1995,

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:24.537
that I heard a loud bang against the glass

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:29.147
that changed my life and ended that of a duck.

00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:34.942
And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.

00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:38.126
This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:39.820
It's laying dead on its belly.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.175
But next to the dead duck is a live duck,

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:45.489
and please pay attention.

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.979
Both are of the male sex.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.083
And then this happened.

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.789
The live duck mounted the dead duck,

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.452
and started to copulate.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.177
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.

00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:03.925
I said, "Something's wrong here."

00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:09.897
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.779
I look. Both are of the male sex.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.418
Homosexual necrophilia.

00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:22.463
So I -- (Laughter)

00:02:22.463 --> 00:02:25.407
I took my camera, I took my notebook,

00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:30.818
took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:36.435
After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:41.244
I had seen enough, and I got hungry,

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.883
and I wanted to go home.

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:47.443
So I went out, collected the duck,

00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:49.399
and before I put it in the freezer,

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:54.275
I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.883
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,

00:02:57.883 --> 00:03:00.924
so it was indeed of the male sex.

00:03:00.924 --> 00:03:04.219
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.810
and only 300 possess a penis.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.197
[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:15.131
I knew I'd seen something special,

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:20.553
but it took me six years to decide to publish it.

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:23.408
(Laughter)

00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:26.939
I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.678
or at the coffee machine,

00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:31.988
but to share this among your peers is something different.

00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:33.806
I didn't have the framework.

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:36.851
So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.155
so I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:41.750
in the mallard."

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.299
And here's the situation again.

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.851
A is my office,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.315
B is the place where the duck hit the glass,

00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:52.373
and C is from where I watched it.

00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:55.070
And here are the ducks again.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.077
As you probably know, in science,

00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:59.260
when you write a kind of special paper,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.259
only six or seven people read it.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.984
(Laughter)

00:04:08.844 --> 00:04:11.444
But then something good happened.

00:04:11.444 --> 00:04:15.952
I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:20.805
and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:

00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:24.488
the Ig Nobel Prize."

00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:26.402
And the Ig Nobel Prize —

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:30.819
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.838
the Ig Nobel Prize honors research

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.915
that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:38.699
with the ultimate goal to make more people

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.763
interested in science.

00:04:41.763 --> 00:04:45.899
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.588
(Laughter)

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:52.344
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams

00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:53.917
didn't call me from Stockholm.

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.070
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.017
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,

00:04:59.017 --> 00:05:02.472
and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony

00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:04.825
held at Harvard University, and this ceremony

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:10.065
is a very nice experience.

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:13.346
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.759
That's the first thing.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.793
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.

00:05:17.793 --> 00:05:21.169
Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.230
who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.209
"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:32.645
under farming conditions in Britain."

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:36.925
(Laughter)

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:40.081
And I think there are one or two more

00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:43.002
Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.

00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:46.729
Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.651
Applause for Dan.

00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:51.953
(Applause)

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:55.697
Dan won his prize in medicine

00:05:55.697 --> 00:05:59.872
for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine

00:05:59.872 --> 00:06:02.729
works better than low-priced fake medicine.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.000
(Laughter)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.818
So here's my one minute of fame,

00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:14.295
my acceptance speech,

00:06:14.295 --> 00:06:16.508
and here's the duck.

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:21.430
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.104
I'm going to pass it around.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:29.393
(Laughter)

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:30.870
Yeah?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.179
You can pass it around.

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:34.560
Please note it's a museum specimen,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.978
but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.

00:06:39.978 --> 00:06:43.984
After winning this prize, my life changed.

00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:46.114
In the first place, people started to send me

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.661
all kinds of duck-related things,

00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:52.713
and I got a real nice collection.

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.040
(Laughter)

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.704
More importantly,

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:05.776
people started to send me their observations

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:08.310
of remarkable animal behavior,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.482
and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,

00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:13.183
I know about it.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:17.531
(Laughter)

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:22.313
This is a moose.

00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:23.840
It's a moose trying to copulate

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.329
with a bronze statue of a bison.

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:31.122
This is in Montana, 2008.

00:07:31.122 --> 00:07:35.202
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.

00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:38.433
This is the Netherlands, 2011.

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:42.709
These are cane toads in Australia.

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:43.964
This is roadkill.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.208
Please note that this is necrophilia.

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:48.916
It's remarkable: the position.

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:53.348
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:57.532
These are pigeons in Rotterdam.

00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:03.373
Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.

00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:07.137
This is a turkey in Wisconsin

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:13.216
on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:15.664
It took all day,

00:08:15.664 --> 00:08:20.795
and the prisoners had a great time.

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:22.727
So what does this mean?

00:08:22.727 --> 00:08:25.975
I mean, the question I ask myself,

00:08:25.975 --> 00:08:27.676
why does this happen in nature?

00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:29.487
Well, what I concluded

00:08:29.487 --> 00:08:31.946
from reviewing all these cases

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:35.914
is that it is important that this happens

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:39.961
only when death is instant

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:42.176
and in a dramatic way

00:08:42.176 --> 00:08:45.113
and in the right position for copulation.

00:08:45.113 --> 00:08:50.771
At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.

00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:53.194
And here you see a dead duck.

00:08:53.194 --> 00:08:55.786
It's been there for three days,

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.840
and it's laying on its back.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.698
So there goes my theory of necrophilia.

00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:05.088
Another example of the impact

00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:07.081
of glass buildings on the life of birds.

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.426
This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:16.312
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window

00:09:16.312 --> 00:09:21.264
from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.

00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:24.213
Here he goes, and here's a short video.

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:25.935
(Music) (Clunk)

00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:33.257
(Clunk)

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.019
(Clunk)

00:09:56.905 --> 00:09:58.420
(Clunk)

00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:01.175
So what this bird does

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:05.273
is fight his own image.

00:10:05.273 --> 00:10:07.551
He sees an intruder in his territory,

00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:10.623
and it's coming all the time and he's there,

00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:12.466
so there is no end to it.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:15.649
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:18.895
that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?

00:10:18.895 --> 00:10:21.943
It's not. I show you here some slides,

00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:23.994
some frames from the video,

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:27.241
and at the last moment before he hits the glass,

00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:29.252
he puts his feet in front,

00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:34.071
and then he bangs against the glass.

00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:38.715
So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.

00:10:38.715 --> 00:10:41.417
That's on June 5 every year.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:44.649
At five minutes to six in the afternoon,

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:48.563
we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:10:48.563 --> 00:10:51.202
the duck comes out of the museum,

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:53.697
and we try to discuss new ways

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:57.551
to prevent birds from colliding with windows.

00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:59.986
And as you know, or as you may not know,

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.585
this is one of the major causes of death

00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:04.090
for birds in the world.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.961
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die

00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:10.186
in collision with glass buildings.

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:16.113
And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant

00:11:16.113 --> 00:11:20.871
and we have a six-course duck dinner.

00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:23.721
So I hope to see you

00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:26.776
next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,

00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:28.123
for Dead Duck Day.

00:11:28.123 --> 00:11:29.394
Thank you.

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:31.412
(Applause)

00:11:31.412 --> 00:11:37.124
Oh, sorry.

00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:39.233
May I have my duck back, please?

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:42.341
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:47.019
Thank you.
