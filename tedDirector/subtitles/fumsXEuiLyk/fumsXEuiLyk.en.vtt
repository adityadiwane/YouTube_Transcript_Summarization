00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.517
So the type of magic I like,
and I'm a magician,

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.715
is magic that uses technology
to create illusions.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070
So I would like to show you
something I've been working on.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:26.341
It's an application

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:31.008
that I think will be useful for artists --
multimedia artists in particular.

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:35.025
It synchronizes videos
across multiple screens of mobile devices.

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.342
I borrowed these three iPods
from people here in the audience

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.572
to show you what I mean.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:47.704
And I'm going to use them to tell you
a little bit about my favorite subject:

00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:48.792
deception.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.012
(Music)

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:58.755
One of my favorite magicians
is Karl Germain.

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.242
He had this wonderful trick
where a rosebush would bloom

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.135
right in front of your eyes.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:10.953
But it was his production of a butterfly
that was the most beautiful.

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:13.834
(Recording) Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:16.236
the creation of life.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.236
(Applause)

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.951
(Music)

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:24.193
Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.321
he said this:

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.169
Announcer: Magic
is the only honest profession.

00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:33.344
A magician promises to deceive you --

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:34.754
and he does.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:38.251
MT: I like to think of myself
as an honest magician.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:39.962
I use a lot of tricks,

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:43.930
which means that sometimes
I have to lie to you.

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:47.454
Now I feel bad about that.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.376
But people lie every day.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.424
(Ringing)

00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:52.461
Hold on.

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.140
Phone: Hey, where are you?

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.526
MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.

00:01:57.257 --> 00:01:58.328
You've all done it.

00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:00.240
(Laughter)

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:01.288
(Music)

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:03.661
Right: I'll be ready
in just a minute, darling.

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:06.463
Center: It's just what I've always wanted.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.236
Left: You were great.

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:10.747
MT: Deception,

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.752
it's a fundamental part of life.

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:15.913
Now polls show

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:20.236
that men tell twice
as many lies as women --

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.156
assuming the women
they asked told the truth.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.315
(Laughing)

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.236
We deceive to gain advantage

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.646
and to hide our weaknesses.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.236
The Chinese general Sun Tzu said
that all war was based on deception.

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:41.236
Oscar Wilde said
the same thing of romance.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.973
Some people deceive

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.212
for money.

00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:47.207
Let's play a game.

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:50.921
Three cards, three chances.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.544
Announcer: One five will get you 10,
10 will get you 20.

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:56.420
Now, where's the lady?

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:57.964
Where is the queen?

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.236
MT: This one?

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:02.837
Sorry. You lose.

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.390
Well, I didn't deceive you.

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:08.031
You deceived yourself.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:09.874
Self-deception.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:14.457
That's when we convince ourselves
that a lie is the truth.

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:17.260
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:23.731
Compulsive gamblers
are experts at self-deception.

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.374
(Slot machine)

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.350
They believe they can win.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.573
They forget the times they lose.

00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:33.386
The brain is very good at forgetting.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.489
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:40.519
Bad experiences quickly disappear.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.182
Which is why in this vast
and lonely cosmos,

00:03:44.206 --> 00:03:47.404
we are so wonderfully optimistic.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.297
Our self-deception
becomes a positive illusion --

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:57.050
why movies are able to take us
onto extraordinary adventures;

00:03:57.074 --> 00:04:00.852
why we believe Romeo
when he says he loves Juliet;

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:03.584
and why single notes of music,

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.926
when played together,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.607
become a sonata and conjure up meaning.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.788
That's "Clair De lune."

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:13.429
Its composer, called Debussy,

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:17.249
said that art was
the greatest deception of all.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.584
Art is a deception
that creates real emotions --

00:04:23.608 --> 00:04:26.840
a lie that creates a truth.

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:31.408
And when you give yourself
over to that deception,

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:33.456
it becomes magic.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.162
[MAGIC]

00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:40.673
(Music fades slowly)

00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:44.023
(Applause)

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:57.180
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:57.204 --> 00:04:59.906
(Applause)
