00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:20.606
So over the past few centuries,
microscopes have revolutionized our world.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:26.252
They revealed to us a tiny world
of objects, life and structures

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:29.158
that are too small for us
to see with our naked eyes.

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:32.177
They are a tremendous contribution
to science and technology.

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:35.404
Today I'd like to introduce you
to a new type of microscope,

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.982
a microscope for changes.

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:40.884
It doesn't use optics
like a regular microscope

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:42.881
to make small objects bigger,

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:47.257
but instead it uses a video camera
and image processing

00:00:47.257 --> 00:00:52.513
to reveal to us the tiniest motions
and color changes in objects and people,

00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:56.355
changes that are impossible
for us to see with our naked eyes.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.475
And it lets us look at our world
in a completely new way.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.385
So what do I mean by color changes?

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:05.217
Our skin, for example,
changes its color very slightly

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:07.214
when the blood flows under it.

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:09.611
That change is incredibly subtle,

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.674
which is why, when you
look at other people,

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.925
when you look at the person
sitting next to you,

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:17.500
you don't see their skin
or their face changing color.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.860
When we look at this video of Steve here,
it appears to us like a static picture,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.720
but once we look at this video
through our new, special microscope,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.320
suddenly we see
a completely different image.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.250
What you see here are small changes
in the color of Steve's skin,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.686
magnified 100 times
so that they become visible.

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:39.953
We can actually see a human pulse.

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:43.180
We can see how fast
Steve's heart is beating,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.535
but we can also see the actual way
that the blood flows in his face.

00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:51.175
And we can do that not just
to visualize the pulse,

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:54.646
but also to actually 
recover our heart rates,

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.439
and measure our heart rates.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.892
And we can do it with regular cameras
and without touching the patients.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:06.509
So here you see the pulse and heart rate
we extracted from a neonatal baby

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.390
from a video we took
with a regular DSLR camera,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.206
and the heart rate measurement we get

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:16.017
is as accurate as the one you'd get
with a standard monitor in a hospital.

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:18.659
And it doesn't even have to be
a video we recorded.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.654
We can do it essentially
with other videos as well.

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:25.555
So I just took a short clip
from "Batman Begins" here

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:27.459
just to show Christian Bale's pulse.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.281
(Laughter)

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:31.404
And you know, presumably
he's wearing makeup,

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:33.357
the lighting here is kind of challenging,

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:36.308
but still, just from the video,
we're able to extract his pulse

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:38.326
and show it quite well.

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:40.246
So how do we do all that?

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:44.844
We basically analyze the changes
in the light that are recorded

00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:47.115
at every pixel in the video over time,

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:48.913
and then we crank up those changes.

00:02:48.913 --> 00:02:51.075
We make them bigger
so that we can see them.

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:52.977
The tricky part is that those signals,

00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:55.910
those changes that we're after,
are extremely subtle,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.689
so we have to be very careful
when you try to separate them

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.520
from noise that always exists in videos.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.515
So we use some clever
image processing techniques

00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:09.509
to get a very accurate measurement
of the color at each pixel in the video,

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.179
and then the way the color
changes over time,

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.872
and then we amplify those changes.

00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:18.852
We make them bigger to create those types
of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,

00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:21.024
that actually show us those changes.

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:25.262
But it turns out we can do that
not just to show tiny changes in color,

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:27.503
but also tiny motions,

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:31.079
and that's because the light
that gets recorded in our cameras

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.889
will change not only if the color
of the object changes,

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.257
but also if the object moves.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.893
So this is my daughter
when she was about two months old.

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.892
It's a video I recorded
about three years ago.

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:46.100
And as new parents, we all want
to make sure our babies are healthy,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.642
that they're breathing,
that they're alive, of course.

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.784
So I too got one of those baby monitors

00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:53.253
so that I could see my daughter
when she was asleep.

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:56.780
And this is pretty much what you'll see
with a standard baby monitor.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.462
You can see the baby's sleeping, but 
there's not too much information there.

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.078
There's not too much we can see.

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:04.902
Wouldn't it be better,
or more informative, or more useful,

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:07.892
if instead we could look
at the view like this.

00:04:07.892 --> 00:04:14.248
So here I took the motions
and I magnified them 30 times,

00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:18.074
and then I could clearly see that my
daughter was indeed alive and breathing.

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.327
(Laughter)

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.249
Here is a side-by-side comparison.

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.732
So again, in the source video,
in the original video,

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:26.368
there's not too much we can see,

00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:30.075
but once we magnify the motions,
the breathing becomes much more visible.

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:32.145
And it turns out, there's
a lot of phenomena

00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:35.768
we can reveal and magnify
with our new motion microscope.

00:04:35.768 --> 00:04:40.332
We can see how our veins and arteries
are pulsing in our bodies.

00:04:40.332 --> 00:04:42.960
We can see that our eyes
are constantly moving

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.847
in this wobbly motion.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:46.356
And that's actually my eye,

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:49.421
and again this video was taken
right after my daughter was born,

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:53.623
so you can see I wasn't getting
too much sleep. (Laughter)

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:56.339
Even when a person is sitting still,

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.383
there's a lot of information
we can extract

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:01.912
about their breathing patterns,
small facial expressions.

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:03.537
Maybe we could use those motions

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.691
to tell us something about
our thoughts or our emotions.

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:09.946
We can also magnify small
mechanical movements,

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:11.501
like vibrations in engines,

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.193
that can help engineers detect
and diagnose machinery problems,

00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:19.931
or see how our buildings and structures
sway in the wind and react to forces.

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.512
Those are all things that our society
knows how to measure in various ways,

00:05:24.512 --> 00:05:26.965
but measuring those motions is one thing,

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:29.241
and actually seeing those
motions as they happen

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.795
is a whole different thing.

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:34.836
And ever since we discovered
this new technology,

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:38.789
we made our code available online so that 
others could use and experiment with it.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.664
It's very simple to use.

00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:42.708
It can work on your own videos.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.901
Our collaborators at Quanta Research
even created this nice website

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.579
where you can upload your videos
and process them online,

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.395
so even if you don't have any experience
in computer science or programming,

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:55.331
you can still very easily experiment
with this new microscope.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.735
And I'd like to show you
just a couple of examples

00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.470
of what others have done with it.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.787
So this video was made by
a YouTube user called Tamez85.

00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:07.250
I don't know who that user is,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.595
but he, or she, used our code

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:13.310
to magnify small belly
movements during pregnancy.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.912
It's kind of creepy.

00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:16.525
(Laughter)

00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:21.486
People have used it to magnify
pulsing veins in their hands.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:25.268
And you know it's not real science
unless you use guinea pigs,

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:28.658
and apparently this guinea pig
is called Tiffany,

00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:31.607
and this YouTube user claims
it is the first rodent on Earth

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:34.295
that was motion-magnified.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.483
You can also do some art with it.

00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:39.501
So this video was sent to me
by a design student at Yale.

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.638
She wanted to see
if there's any difference

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:43.160
in the way her classmates move.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.369
She made them all stand still,
and then magnified their motions.

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.747
It's like seeing 
still pictures come to life.

00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:53.180
And the nice thing with 
all those examples

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.476
is that we had nothing to do with them.

00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:59.330
We just provided this new tool,
a new way to look at the world,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.462
and then people find other interesting,
new and creative ways of using it.

00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:06.226
But we didn't stop there.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:09.477
This tool not only allows us
to look at the world in a new way,

00:07:09.477 --> 00:07:11.845
it also redefines what we can do

00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:15.026
and pushes the limits of what
we can do with our cameras.

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:17.255
So as scientists, we started wondering,

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:21.040
what other types of physical phenomena
produce tiny motions

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.943
that we could now use
our cameras to measure?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.944
And one such phenomenon
that we focused on recently is sound.

00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:30.049
Sound, as we all know,
is basically changes

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.232
in air pressure that
travel through the air.

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:35.853
Those pressure waves hit objects
and they create small vibrations in them,

00:07:35.853 --> 00:07:38.385
which is how we hear
and how we record sound.

00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:42.053
But it turns out that sound
also produces visual motions.

00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:44.886
Those are motions
that are not visible to us

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.887
but are visible to a camera
with the right processing.

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:49.460
So here are two examples.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.074
This is me demonstrating
my great singing skills.

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:54.698
(Singing)

00:07:54.698 --> 00:07:56.134
(Laughter)

00:07:56.134 --> 00:07:59.120
And I took a high-speed video
of my throat while I was humming.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.884
Again, if you stare at that video,

00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:02.960
there's not too much
you'll be able to see,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.292
but once we magnify the motions 100 times,
we can see all the motions and ripples

00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:10.566
in the neck that are involved
in producing the sound.

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:13.306
That signal is there in that video.

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:15.976
We also know that singers
can break a wine glass

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:17.439
if they hit the correct note.

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:19.204
So here, we're going to play a note

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:21.730
that's in the resonance
frequency of that glass

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.778
through a loudspeaker that's next to it.

00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:28.197
Once we play that note
and magnify the motions 250 times,

00:08:28.197 --> 00:08:30.535
we can very clearly see 
how the glass vibrates

00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:34.105
and resonates in response to the sound.

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:36.525
It's not something you're used
to seeing every day.

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:40.054
But this made us think.
It gave us this crazy idea.

00:08:40.054 --> 00:08:45.662
Can we actually invert this process
and recover sound from video

00:08:45.662 --> 00:08:49.697
by analyzing the tiny vibrations
that sound waves create in objects,

00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:54.474
and essentially convert those
back into the sounds that produced them.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:58.931
In this way, we can turn
everyday objects into microphones.

00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:01.163
So that's exactly what we did.

00:09:01.163 --> 00:09:03.979
So here's an empty bag of chips
that was lying on a table,

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:06.804
and we're going to turn that 
bag of chips into a microphone

00:09:06.804 --> 00:09:08.395
by filming it with a video camera

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:11.623
and analyzing the tiny motions
that sound waves create in it.

00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:14.419
So here's the sound
that we played in the room.

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:18.853
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:25.032
And this is a high-speed video
we recorded of that bag of chips.

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:26.306
Again it's playing.

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:29.648
There's no chance you'll be able
to see anything going on in that video

00:09:29.648 --> 00:09:30.706
just by looking at it,

00:09:30.706 --> 00:09:33.690
but here's the sound we were able
to recover just by analyzing

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.873
the tiny motions in that video.

00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:38.682
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:54.471
I call it -- Thank you.

00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:59.696
(Applause)

00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:04.223
I call it the visual microphone.

00:10:04.223 --> 00:10:07.613
We actually extract audio signals
from video signals.

00:10:07.613 --> 00:10:10.794
And just to give you a sense
of the scale of the motions here,

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:16.135
a pretty loud sound will cause that bag
of chips to move less than a micrometer.

00:10:16.135 --> 00:10:18.874
That's one thousandth of a millimeter.

00:10:18.874 --> 00:10:22.435
That's how tiny the motions are
that we are now able to pull out

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:25.678
just by observing how light
bounces off objects

00:10:25.678 --> 00:10:27.814
and gets recorded by our cameras.

00:10:27.814 --> 00:10:31.064
We can recover sounds
from other objects, like plants.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:37.380
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:10:39.214 --> 00:10:41.211
And we can recover speech as well.

00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:43.788
So here's a person speaking in a room.

00:10:43.788 --> 00:10:47.991
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:52.221
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go.

00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:54.980
Michael Rubinstein: And here's
that speech again recovered

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.254
just from this video
of that same bag of chips.

00:10:58.254 --> 00:11:03.085
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:07.944
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go.

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:10.290
MR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.413
because those are said to be
the first words

00:11:12.413 --> 00:11:16.574
that Thomas Edison spoke 
into his phonograph in 1877.

00:11:16.574 --> 00:11:19.802
It was one of the first sound
recording devices in history.

00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:23.129
It basically directed the sounds
onto a diaphragm

00:11:23.129 --> 00:11:27.208
that vibrated a needle that essentially
engraved the sound on tinfoil

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.483
that was wrapped around the cylinder.

00:11:29.483 --> 00:11:35.426
Here's a demonstration of recording and 
replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.

00:11:35.426 --> 00:11:38.446
(Video) Voice: Testing,
testing, one two three.

00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:41.859
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:41.859 --> 00:11:45.528
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:45.528 --> 00:11:48.268
Testing, testing, one two three.

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:52.424
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:57.648
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:57.648 --> 00:12:01.665
MR: And now, 137 years later,

00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:05.752
we're able to get sound
in pretty much similar quality

00:12:05.752 --> 00:12:09.831
but by just watching objects
vibrate to sound with cameras,

00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:11.765
and we can even do that when the camera

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:15.999
is 15 feet away from the object,
behind soundproof glass.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:19.219
So this is the sound that we were 
able to recover in that case.

00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:24.513
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:12:24.513 --> 00:12:29.272
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:33.034
MR: And of course, surveillance is
the first application that comes to mind.

00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:36.029
(Laughter)

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:40.085
But it might actually be useful
for other things as well.

00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:42.925
Maybe in the future, we'll be able
to use it, for example,

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:45.177
to recover sound across space,

00:12:45.177 --> 00:12:48.753
because sound can't travel
in space, but light can.

00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:51.157
We've only just begun exploring

00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:54.176
other possible uses
for this new technology.

00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:57.008
It lets us see physical processes
that we know are there

00:12:57.008 --> 00:13:00.564
but that we've never been able
to see with our own eyes until now.

00:13:00.564 --> 00:13:01.768
This is our team.

00:13:01.768 --> 00:13:04.647
Everything I showed you today
is a result of a collaboration

00:13:04.647 --> 00:13:06.838
with this great group
of people you see here,

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:10.005
and I encourage you and welcome you
to check out our website,

00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:11.451
try it out yourself,

00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:14.423
and join us in exploring
this world of tiny motions.

00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:16.048
Thank you.

00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:17.302
