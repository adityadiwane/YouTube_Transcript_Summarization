00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.160
is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.160
In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
in New York City.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
And it cost about 500 dollars to start it,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
-- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
-- would come to cost two and a half million dollars.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.160
That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
And that's what I want to talk about today,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
and how that relates to the emergence of social production.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.160
for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
just like any other industrial organization --

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
things that this industrial model could produce.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Now, the term "information society," "information economy,"

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.160
today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
It's just been industrial,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160
depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.160
the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.160
Now, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
the world of supercomputers had a bombshell.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer --

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S.,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
operations per second that the computer's capable of running --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.160
sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.160
by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
coming from radio telescopes.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.160
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160
-- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.160
practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.160
capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.160
in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.160
What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.160
the most important means, the most important components of the core

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
-- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
capacity in the hands of the entire population,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.160
and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
-- the other major experience, the other major input --

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.160
which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long --

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
is not something that's the same or fungible among people.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.160
to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
into production as we hold this machine.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.160
What's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160
is the story of free or open source software.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
This is market share of Apache Web server

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.160
-- one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
In 1995, two groups of people said,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
you know, we really need this, we should write one,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
and what are we going to do with what --

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
The other was Microsoft.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Now, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
anything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
and was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.160
engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.160
including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.160
on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue --

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:00.160
in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, because

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.160
it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.160
So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
will actually spend five minutes here,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:56.160
once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Now, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
-- well, not so little, medium little -- tries to do research on Barbie.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.160
This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produce

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160
which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.160
On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
-- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here --

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.160
but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.160
including the controversies over body image and commercialization,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.160
the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Another portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160
-- we hire people to look at websites and tell you --

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.160
each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.160
to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.160
it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
and psychological motivations to do something interesting.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.160
This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160
of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing --

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:01.160
the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.160
The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
which is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
people out there on the Web, for whatever reason -- vanity, pleasure --

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.160
produced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.160
Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.160
market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.160
So, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
-- our PCs -- we share them together. We also see this in wireless.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.160
area, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.160
that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.160
and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.160
to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.160
When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.160
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:48.160
places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.160
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.160
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.160
be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160
armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.160
It would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Right? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
for very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
storage to create something.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.160
So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.160
framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
they could be decentralized, or centralized.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
The price system was a market-based and decentralized system.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.160
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:15.160
to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
That was, in fact, economic.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
of social sharing and exchange.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.160
Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
as social beings. We do it all the time.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160
What characterizes them is decentralized authority.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.160
May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
if they want to, by themselves or with others,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
because property is one mechanism of coordination.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
But it's not the only one.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160
Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
interesting problems; who's available and good for something;

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
you don't increase the probability of being invited back.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.160
And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
It also requires certain new organizational approaches.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.160
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
You have to hire people who know what they're doing.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Now, take the same problem,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
Five minutes, instead of watching TV?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.160
involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.160
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160
Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.160
As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
Instead of building well-behaved appliances

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160
-- things that you know what they'll do in advance --

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
a new set of things people value.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160
You build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.160
And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.160
build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
-- that's what Google does, essentially.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160
That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160
So, social production is a real fact, not a fad.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160
It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.160
Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.160
because of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.160
the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.160
But -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160
-- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.160
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.160
a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.160
It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.160
and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:31.160
Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.160
for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:41.160
or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160
Thank you.
