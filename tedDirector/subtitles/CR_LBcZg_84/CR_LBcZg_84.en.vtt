00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.511
The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.677
is almost like the weatherman.

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:24.193
We are always chasing storms.

00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:29.076
We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms, that is.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:31.844
And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.294
but we rarely see or listen to one.

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:36.928
So I always like to start these talks

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:39.910
by actually introducing you to one of them.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.337
Actually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron --

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.560
a hundred brain cells simultaneously --

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.029
we could measure the electrical sparks

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:50.709
of a hundred cells in the same animal,

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:52.511
this is the first image we got,

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.826
the first 10 seconds of this recording.

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:58.177
So we got a little snippet of a thought,

00:00:58.177 --> 00:01:01.082
and we could see it in front of us.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:02.094
I always tell the students

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:06.200
that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.826
because we are dealing with a system

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.743
that is only comparable in terms of number of cells

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.679
to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe.

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.709
And here we are, out of billions of neurons,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.527
just recording, 10 years ago, a hundred.

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:21.110
We are doing a thousand now.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.510
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.442
Because, if you don't know yet,

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:33.692
everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms,

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:38.343
comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:42.228
and define our memories, our beliefs,

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:44.928
our feelings, our plans for the future.

00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:47.326
Everything that we ever do,

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:52.393
everything that every human has ever done, do or will do,

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:57.827
requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms.

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:00.310
And the sound of a brainstorm, if you've never heard one,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.659
is somewhat like this.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.805
You can put it louder if you can.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:13.208
My son calls this "making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:14.693
This is a brain.

00:02:14.693 --> 00:02:18.127
This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker

00:02:18.127 --> 00:02:20.993
and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing,

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:25.615
your brain will sound like this -- my brain, any brain.

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:29.377
And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:34.727
is to actually listen to these symphonies, these brain symphonies,

00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:38.127
and try to extract from them the messages they carry.

00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:40.978
In particular, about 12 years ago

00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:44.026
we created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces.

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.728
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works.

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:52.294
The idea is, let's have some sensors that listen to these storms, this electrical firing,

00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:55.376
and see if you can, in the same time that it takes

00:02:55.376 --> 00:03:00.345
for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal --

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:03.209
about half a second --

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.560
let's see if we can read these signals,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.960
extract the motor messages that are embedded in it,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.232
translate it into digital commands

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.118
and send it to an artificial device

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:19.011
that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.859
And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.377
when we compare to the way the body does that.

00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.243
And if we can actually provide feedback,

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:34.977
sensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator

00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:37.228
that is now under the control of the brain,

00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:38.539
back to the brain,

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:40.660
how the brain deals with that,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.561
of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery.

00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:47.882
And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.

00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:50.843
We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora

00:03:50.843 --> 00:03:53.311
that became one of the superstars of this field.

00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.610
And Aurora liked to play video games.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.983
As you can see here,

00:03:56.983 --> 00:04:01.927
she likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:06.598
And as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:10.881
So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.731
with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick,

00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.682
Aurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:19.151
And if she's doing that,

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.465
because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor,

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:25.415
she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:28.365
And I can tell you, any monkey will do anything for you

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:31.465
if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice.

00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:34.196
Actually any primate will do that.

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.530
Think about that.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.930
Well, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.365
and doing a thousand trials a day

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:45.248
and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice,

00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:48.647
we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:50.294
and sending them to a robotic arm

00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:54.165
that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making.

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.948
Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface

00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:02.648
and have Aurora play the game just by thinking,

00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:05.265
without interference of her body.

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:08.181
Her brainstorms would control an arm

00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:10.890
that would move the cursor and cross the target.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.081
And to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.281
She played the game without moving her body.

00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:20.518
So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now,

00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:23.730
this is the exact first moment she got that.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.514
That's the exact first moment

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:32.281
a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.981
and could act outside, in that outside world,

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.947
just by controlling an artificial device.

00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:43.864
And Aurora kept playing the game, kept finding the little target

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:47.781
and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get, that she craved for.

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:54.482
Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.

00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:57.445
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later,

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.131
after the first video that I showed to you,

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:02.781
is under the control of Aurora's brain

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.949
and is moving the cursor to get to the target.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.848
And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm,

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:15.564
but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases.

00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:19.631
She can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game.

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:21.231
By all purposes and means,

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.347
Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device

00:06:25.347 --> 00:06:28.097
as an extension of her body.

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:31.630
The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.714
has been expanded to get one more arm.

00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:38.064
Well, we did that 10 years ago.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.897
Just fast forward 10 years.

00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:45.880
Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.364
You can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.

00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:55.614
And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them,

00:06:55.614 --> 00:07:00.053
or you can train them to assume in a virtual world

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:03.097
the first-person perspective of that avatar

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:08.748
and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs.

00:07:08.748 --> 00:07:11.514
And what we did basically was to train the animals

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.564
to learn how to control these avatars

00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:18.463
and explore objects that appear in the virtual world.

00:07:18.463 --> 00:07:20.764
And these objects are visually identical,

00:07:20.764 --> 00:07:24.647
but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects,

00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:31.047
they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:35.063
that goes back directly to the monkey's brain,

00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:40.115
informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching.

00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:44.880
And in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.314
and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense.

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:53.730
And you truly liberate the brain now

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.114
because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.

00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:03.114
And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain

00:08:03.114 --> 00:08:05.547
without the interference of the skin.

00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:08.081
So what you see here is this is the design of the task.

00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:12.331
You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets.

00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:16.680
And he has to select one because only one carries the reward,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.547
the orange juice that they want to get.

00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:24.180
And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.180
And that's exactly what they do.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.615
This is a complete liberation of the brain

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:33.897
from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task.

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:38.064
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets.

00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:43.715
And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain.

00:08:43.715 --> 00:08:47.598
And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.

00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:51.430
The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.914
And by the way, they don't read English anyway,

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:59.130
so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.064
And yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination,

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:06.281
and they can press it and select it.

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:08.963
So when we look at the brains of these animals,

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:12.630
on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.831
showing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms,

00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:18.898
of this sample of neurons in the brain

00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:21.014
when the animal is using a joystick.

00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:23.614
And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows.

00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:28.797
The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions.

00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:34.480
The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.614
and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar.

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:43.680
As fast as we can reset our computers,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.498
the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool,

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:54.748
as if this too was a part of that primate's body.

00:09:54.748 --> 00:09:59.463
The brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure.

00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:03.081
So that suggests to us that our sense of self

00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:07.231
does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies,

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:12.949
but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:17.713
Our violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing --

00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:24.564
they all become assimilated by this voracious, amazing, dynamic system called the brain.

00:10:24.564 --> 00:10:26.263
How far can we take it?

00:10:26.263 --> 00:10:30.481
Well, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit.

00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:32.963
We had an animal running on a treadmill

00:10:32.963 --> 00:10:35.230
at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.930
producing the brainstorms necessary to move.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.021
And we had a robotic device, a humanoid robot,

00:10:42.021 --> 00:10:44.415
in Kyoto, Japan at ATR Laboratories

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:50.509
that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain,

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:53.782
a human brain, or a primate brain.

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:58.380
What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.847
was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk

00:11:01.847 --> 00:11:05.914
while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke,

00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:11.147
so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.

00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:15.214
So she could be rewarded, not by what her body was doing

00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:20.175
but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:22.784
controlled by her brain activity.

00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:29.902
Funny thing, that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less

00:11:29.902 --> 00:11:34.052
than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head, the head of the monkey,

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:37.922
and reach its own muscle.

00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:43.952
The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger, across the planet.

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:50.352
This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.

00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:55.619
This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:59.319
under the control of the brain activity of a primate.

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:01.308
So where are we taking all this?

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:03.651
What are we going to do with all this research,

00:12:03.651 --> 00:12:09.319
besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears?

00:12:09.319 --> 00:12:14.152
Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology

00:12:14.152 --> 00:12:19.636
and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world.

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:24.219
Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms

00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:26.335
into action, into movement.

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:31.569
Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements,

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:36.736
they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord.

00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:39.186
So our idea is to create a bypass,

00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:43.218
is to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals,

00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:47.268
larger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again,

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:51.237
bypass the lesion using computational microengineering

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:58.351
and send it to a new body, a whole body called an exoskeleton,

00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:03.918
a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients.

00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:08.044
And you can see an image produced by this consortium.

00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:12.103
This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:14.886
that is putting together scientists from Europe,

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:16.751
from here in the United States, and in Brazil

00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:21.268
together to work to actually get this new body built --

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:24.602
a body that we believe, through the same plastic mechanisms

00:13:24.602 --> 00:13:30.404
that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface

00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:36.034
and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life.

00:13:36.034 --> 00:13:39.718
This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients,

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:43.486
not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make

00:13:43.486 --> 00:13:46.693
and translate them into movements of this new body,

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:53.451
but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.

00:13:53.451 --> 00:13:57.302
So I was told about 10 years ago

00:13:57.302 --> 00:14:02.368
that this would never happen, that this was close to impossible.

00:14:02.368 --> 00:14:04.819
And I can only tell you that as a scientist,

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:07.805
I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:12.853
watching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon.

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.314
And I was five years old,

00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:18.554
and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job;

00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:20.986
after all, they were very proficient --

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:24.436
but just seeing that as a kid

00:14:24.436 --> 00:14:27.421
made me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me,

00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:29.266
that "impossible is just the possible

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:33.170
that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true."

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.969
So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk.

00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:40.220
I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.670
Thank you.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:49.699
(Applause)
