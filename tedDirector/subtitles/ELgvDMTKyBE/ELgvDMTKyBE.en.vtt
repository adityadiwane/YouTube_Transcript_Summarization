00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
one translation of which is, "The world is sound."

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
So you are, in fact, a chord --

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
each of you an individual chord.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
One definition of health may be

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that that chord is in complete harmony.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Your ears can't hear that chord;

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Incidentally, we see just one octave.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
They work even when you sleep.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
The smallest sound you can perceive

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
The loudest sound you can hear

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
is a trillion times more powerful than that.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Ears are made not for hearing,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
but for listening.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Listening is an active skill,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at --

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
it's a relationship with sound.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
places you can listen from?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Here are two of them.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Reductive listening is listening "for."

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
It reduces everything down to what's relevant

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and it discards everything that's not relevant.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Men typically listen reductively.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
So he's saying, "I've got this problem."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
That's the way we talk, right guys?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Expansive listening, on the other hand,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is listening "with," not listening "for."

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
It's got no destination in mind --

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
it's just enjoying the journey.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Women typically listen expansively.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
possibly both talking at the same time.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
(Laughter)

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
practice expansive listening,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and you can transform your relationships.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
is noise, surrounding us all the time.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Noise like this, according to the European Union,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
is reducing the health and the quality of life

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
of 25 percent

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
of the population of Europe.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Two percent of the population of Europe --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that's 16 million people --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are having their sleep devastated

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
by noise like that.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Noise kills

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
200,000 people a year in Europe.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's a really big problem.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
It looks a bit like this.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The trouble with widespread headphone use

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
is it brings three really big health issues.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
"schizophonia."

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
It's a dislocation

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
between what you see and what you hear.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So, we're inviting into our lives

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
the voices of people who are not present with us.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I think there's something deeply unhealthy

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
about living all the time in schizophonia.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
is compression.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
We squash music to fit it into our pocket

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and there is a cost attached to this.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Music)

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
(Music)

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I do hope that some of you at least

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
can hear the difference between those two.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
There is a cost of compression.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
You're having to imagine it.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
It's not good for you in the long run.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The third problem with headphones is this: deafness --

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
noise-induced hearing disorder.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but really worryingly,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
16 percent --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
roughly one in six -- of American teenagers

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
as a result of headphone abuse.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
One study at an American university

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
found that 61 percent of college freshmen

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
had damaged hearing

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
as a result of headphone abuse.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Now that's a really serious problem.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and pass these on to your children, please.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Professional hearing protectors are great;

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I use some all the time.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
it's too loud.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And thirdly, if you're in bad sound,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Protect your ears in that way.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
WWB:

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Wind, water, birds --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
stochastic natural sounds

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
composed of lots of individual random events,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
all of it very healthy,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Silence is beautiful.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
The Elizabethans described language

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
as decorated silence.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
I urge you to move away from silence with intention

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and to design soundscapes just like works of art.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It's fun to get into designing with sound.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Sound design is the future,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
eight ways sound can improve health.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
it's also now being used to treat cancer.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
It's been around for thousands of years.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
I do urge you to explore this.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
There are great things being done there, treating now autism,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
dementia and other conditions.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
if it's music that's made with good intention,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
made with love, generally.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
There are all sorts of types of music

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that are very healthy.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And four modalities where you need to take some action

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and get involved.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
First of all, listen consciously.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound --

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
create sound.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
The voice is the instrument we all play,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
You can do this in groups as well.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
to make music and sound in a group of people,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
whichever style you enjoy particularly.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
at home and at work.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And let's start to speak up

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
when people are assailing us

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
with the noise that I played you early on.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to improve your health with sound.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and if we all start doing these things,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
we will take a very big step in that direction.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So I urge you to take that path.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
I wish you sound health.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
(Applause)
