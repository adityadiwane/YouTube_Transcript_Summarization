00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:16.677
Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,

00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:21.172
cameras, microphones to represent the world

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:23.336
in an alternative way,

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.370
as much as possible?

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.324
How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:32.042
to create a new form of cinema?

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:37.035
And actually, why do we record?

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.953
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:43.936
that I started to make films 10 years ago,

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:47.424
first with a friend, Christophe Abric.

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.809
He had a website, La Blogothèque,

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.475
dedicated to independent music.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:54.130
We were crazy about music.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.822
We wanted to represent 
music in a different way,

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.410
to film the music we love,
the musicians we admired,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.871
as much as possible, far 
from the music industry

00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.253
and far from the cliches attached to it.

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.219
We started to publish every week

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.969
sessions on the Internet.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.290
We are going to see a few extracts now.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.744
From Grizzly Bear in the shower

00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:26.940
to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.358
From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:37.281
to Tom Jones in his 
hotel room in New York.

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.707
From Arcade Fire in an elevator

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:42.856
in the Olympia

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:47.554
to Beirut going down
a staircase in Brooklyn.

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:52.500
From R.E.M. in a car

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.863
to The National around a table at night

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:58.620
in the south of France.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.952
From Bon Iver playing with some friends

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:04.925
in an apartment in Montmartre

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:08.783
to Yeasayer having a long night,

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:11.866
and many, many, many more

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:14.370
unknown or very famous bands.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.926
We published all those films

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.882
for free on the Internet,

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:20.898
and we wanted to share

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:23.068
all those films and represent music

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:25.828
in a different way.

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:28.998
We wanted to create 
another type of intimacy

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:30.662
using all those new technologies.

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:33.768
At the time, 10 years ago actually,

00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:36.018
there was no such project on the Internet,

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:39.663
and I guess that's why the project we 
were making, the Take Away Shows,

00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:40.940
got quite successful,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720
reaching millions of viewers.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.920
After a while, I got a bit —

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.830
I wanted to go somewhere else.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.800
I felt the need to travel and
to discover some other music,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.735
to explore the world,

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:56.523
going to other corners,

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:58.564
and actually it was also

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:02.535
this idea of nomadic cinema,
sort of, that I had in mind.

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:09.583
How could the use of new technologies 
and the road fit together?

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.431
How could I edit my films in a bus

00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:13.466
crossing the Andes?

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:15.400
So I went on five-year travels

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.334
around the globe.

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:22.310
I started at the time in the digital film 
and music label collection Petites Planètes,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.526
which was also an homage to
French filmmaker Chris Marker.

00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:28.371
We're going to see now a few more extracts

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:31.176
of those new films.

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:43.320
From the tecno brega diva of
northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos

00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:47.671
to a female ensemble in Chechnya.

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:56.315
From experimental electronic music 
in Singapore with One Man Nation

00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:04.322
to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing
on his rooftop in São Paolo.

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:11.846
From The Bambir, the great 
rock band from Armenia

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:14.303
to some traditional songs

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:18.114
in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.

00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:26.011
From White Shoes, a great retro 
pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:33.390
to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary 
band from Kiev, Ukraine.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.020
From Tomi Lebrero

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.136
and his bandoneon and his friends
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.735
to many other places

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:45.412
and musicians around the world.

00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:48.381
My desire was to make it as a trek.

00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:50.147
To do all those films,

00:04:50.147 --> 00:04:51.778
it would have been impossible

00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:53.229
with a big company behind me,

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.630
with a structure or anything.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.711
I was traveling alone with a backpack —

00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:00.180
computer, camera, microphones in it.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.965
Alone, actually, but 
just with local people,

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:05.800
meeting my team, which was absolutely not

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.715
professional people, on the spot there,

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:11.976
going from one place to another

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:13.457
and to make cinema as a trek.

00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:16.352
I really believed that cinema could be

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:18.544
this very simple thing:

00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:23.263
I want to make a film and you're going 
to give me a place to stay for the night.

00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:28.195
I give you a moment of cinema
and you offer me a capirinha.

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:30.480
Well, or other drinks,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.715
depending on where you are.

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:36.172
In Peru, they drink pisco sour.

00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:41.014
Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,

00:05:41.014 --> 00:05:46.289
I had no idea about what I would do there.

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.569
And I just had one phone number, actually,

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.064
of one person.

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:56.407
Three months later,

00:05:56.407 --> 00:06:00.735
after traveling all around the 
country, I had recorded 33 films,

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.755
only with the help of local people,

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:06.217
only with the help of people

00:06:06.217 --> 00:06:08.469
that I was asking all the 
time the same question:

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.515
What is important to record here today?

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:15.343
By living in such a way,

00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:18.174
by working without any structure,

00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:23.369
I was able to react to the moment

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.787
and to decide, oh, this is 
important to make now.

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:29.033
This is important to 
record that whole person.

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:33.049
This is important to create this exchange.

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:36.100
When I went to Chechnya,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.310
the first person I met

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.520
looked at me and was like,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.730
"What are you doing here?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.734
Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:48.872
What kind of problems 
are you going to study?"

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:51.482
Well, I was there to research

00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:54.440
on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.575
incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,

00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:02.849
which is absolutely unknown 
outside of the region.

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.903
As soon as people understood

00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:07.343
that I would give them those films —

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:09.953
I would publish them online for free
under a Creative Commons license,

00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:11.955
but I would also really 
give them to the people

00:07:11.955 --> 00:07:13.767
and I would let them do 
what they want with it.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.690
I just want to represent 
them in a beautiful light.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.378
I just want to portray them in a way that

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:21.649
their grandchildren are going
to look at their grandfather,

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.204
and they're going to be like,

00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:28.288
"Whoa, my grandfather is as 
cool as Beyoncé." (Laughter)

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:30.144
It's a really important thing.

00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:33.643
(Applause)

00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:34.948
It's really important,

00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:36.604
because that's the way

00:07:36.604 --> 00:07:40.430
people are going to look differently at 
their own culture, at their own land.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.614
They're going to think about it differently.

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:47.710
It may be a way to maintain 
a certain diversity.

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:52.549
Why you will record?

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:54.710
Hmm. There's a really good quote

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.634
by American thinker Hakim Bey

00:07:56.634 --> 00:08:00.060
which says, "Every recording

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.966
is a tombstone of a live performance."

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:06.981
It's a really good 
sentence to keep in mind

00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.889
nowadays in an era saturated by images.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.409
What's the point of that?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.189
Where do we go with it?

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.470
I was researching. I was still 
keeping this idea in mind:

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.085
What's the point?

00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:23.305
I was researching on music, trying to pull,

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:26.173
trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.367
Where is this all coming from?

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.718
I am French. I had no idea about

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:33.164
what I would discover, 
which is a very simple thing:

00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:35.949
Everything was sacred, at first,

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:39.369
and music was spiritual healing.

00:08:41.472 --> 00:08:44.767
How could I use my camera,

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:49.255
my little tool, to get closer

00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:51.701
and maybe not only capture the trance

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:57.595
but find an equivalent, 
a cine-trance, maybe,

00:08:57.595 --> 00:09:00.047
something in complete harmony

00:09:00.047 --> 00:09:02.815
with the people?

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:07.154
That is now my new research I'm doing

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:11.575
on spirituality, on new 
spirits around the world.

00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:15.376
Maybe a few more extracts now.

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:24.689
From the Tana Toraja 
funeral ritual in Indonesia

00:09:29.127 --> 00:09:32.645
to an Easter ceremony 
in the north of Ethiopia.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:38.198
From jathilan, a popular trance ritual

00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:41.299
on the island of Java,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.722
to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.357
The Sufi rituals of Chechnya

00:09:57.386 --> 00:10:02.669
to a mass in the holiest 
church of Armenia.

00:10:06.846 --> 00:10:08.691
Some Sufi songs in Harar,

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.377
the holy city of Ethiopia,

00:10:14.102 --> 00:10:16.281
to an ayahuasca ceremony

00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:20.404
deep in the Amazon of 
Peru with the Shipibo.

00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:26.162
Then to my new project, 
the one I'm doing now

00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.798
here in Brazil, named "Híbridos."

00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:29.584
I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.

00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:34.547
It's research on the new 
spiritualities all around the country.

00:10:34.547 --> 00:10:40.505
This is my quest, my own little quest 
of what I call experimental ethnography,

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:48.773
trying to hybrid all 
those different genres,

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:52.060
trying to regain a certain complexity.

00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.000
Why do we record?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.681
I was still there.

00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:02.494
I really believe cinema teaches us to see.

00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:03.900
The way we show the world

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.150
is going to change the 
way we see this world,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.290
and we live in a moment where the mass media

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.899
are doing a terrible, terrible job

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:15.126
at representing the world:

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:19.160
violence, extremists,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.314
only spectacular events,

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:23.541
only simplifications of everyday life.

00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:25.666
I think we are recording

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:29.252
to regain a certain complexity.

00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:34.423
To reinvent life today,

00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:38.213
we have to make new forms of images.

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:40.377
And it's very simple.

00:11:40.377 --> 00:11:43.060
Muito obrigado.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.158
(Applause)

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:57.263
Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

00:11:57.263 --> 00:12:00.301
Merci. We have to prepare for
the following performance,

00:12:00.301 --> 00:12:02.888
and I have a question for you,
and the question is this:

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:06.914
You show up in places like the 
ones you just have shown us,

00:12:06.914 --> 00:12:08.818
and you are carrying a camera

00:12:08.818 --> 00:12:11.313
and I assume that you are welcome

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:14.000
but you are not always absolutely welcome.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.634
You walk into sacred rituals,

00:12:16.634 --> 00:12:20.471
private moments in a village, a town,

00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.680
a group of people.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.576
How do you break the barrier

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.859
when you show up with a lens?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.605
VM: I think you break it with your body,

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:35.243
more than with your knowledge.

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:37.610
That's what it taught me to travel,

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.433
to trust the memory of the body

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:43.083
more than the memory of the brain.

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:45.395
The respect is stepping forward,

00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:48.240
not stepping backward, and I really think that

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.190
by engaging your body in the
moment, in the ceremony,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.553
in the places, people welcome you

00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:55.237
and understand your energy.

00:12:55.237 --> 00:12:56.900
BG: You told me that most of the videos

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.569
you have made are 
actually one single shot.

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:01.177
You don't do much editing.

00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:02.921
I mean, you edited the ones for us

00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:05.486
at the beginning of the sessions
because of the length, etc.

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.313
Otherwise, you just go in and capture

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:09.119
whatever happens in front of your eyes

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:11.853
without much planning, and so is that the case?

00:13:11.853 --> 00:13:13.586
It's correct?

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:15.594
VM: My idea is that I think that

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:19.614
as long as we don't cut, in a way,

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:22.719
as long as we let the viewer watch,

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.688
more and more viewers 
are going to feel closer,

00:13:25.688 --> 00:13:28.501
are going to get closer to the moment,

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:32.337
to that moment and to that place.

00:13:32.337 --> 00:13:35.869
I really think of that as a matter 
of respecting the viewer,

00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:39.581
to not cut all the time from one place to another,

00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:41.645
to just let the time go.

00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:43.749
BG: Tell me in a few words 
about your new project,

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:45.284
"Híbridos," here in Brazil.

00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:47.062
Just before coming to 
TEDGlobal, you have actually

00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:49.333
been traveling around 
the country for that.

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.156
Tell us a couple of things.

00:13:51.156 --> 00:13:53.485
VM: "Híbridos" is — 
I really believe Brazil,

00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:57.658
far from the cliches, is the greatest
religious country in the world,

00:13:57.658 --> 00:14:00.504
the greatest country 
in terms of spirituality

00:14:00.504 --> 00:14:03.541
and in experimentations in spiritualities.

00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.515
And it's a big project I'm 
doing over this year,

00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:11.315
which is researching in very
different regions of Brazil,

00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:13.420
in very different forms of cults,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.308
and trying to understand 
how people live together

00:14:15.308 --> 00:14:16.753
with spirituality nowadays.

00:14:16.753 --> 00:14:20.489
BG: The man who is going to 
appear onstage momentarily,

00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:22.199
and Vincent's going to introduce him,

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:25.851
is one of the subjects of 
one of his past videos.

00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:27.718
When did you do a video with him?

00:14:27.718 --> 00:14:30.272
VM: I guess four years ago,

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:32.758
four years in my first travel.

00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:35.602
BG: So it was one of 
your first ones in Brazil.

00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:37.833
VM: It was amongst the 
first ones in Brazil, yeah.

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:39.290
I shot the film in Recife,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.259
in the place where he is from.

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:44.269
BG: So let's introduce him. 
Who are we waiting for?

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:45.740
VM: I'll just make it very short.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.343
It's a very great honor for 
me to welcome onstage

00:14:48.343 --> 00:14:51.304
one of the greatest Brazilian 
musicians of all time.

00:14:51.304 --> 00:14:53.643
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.555
BG: Naná Vasconcelos!

00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:59.961
(Applause)

00:15:02.563 --> 00:15:09.309
(Music)

00:19:19.657 --> 00:19:23.815
Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle.

00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:03.636
(Applause)
