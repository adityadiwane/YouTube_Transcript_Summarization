00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:20.582
On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:25.045
that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:29.552
that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:33.599
making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.864
This one is more than 400 years old.

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:41.328
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:45.624
and it was the imperfections that people cherished.

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:53.696
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:56.805
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.289
takes another day or two to cool down, but raku

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.092
is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:10.647
up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,

00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:14.305
and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.123
you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,

00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:19.710
and you reach in with these long metal tongs,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.195
you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:29.109
would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.341
and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.506
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:39.171
a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,

00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:42.195
which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:47.107
and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:51.987
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:57.085
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.

00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:01.581
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,

00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.885
but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.350
and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.623
like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.234
on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:18.313
to room temperature in the space of just a minute.

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:24.264
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:28.029
I find in so many things that tension between

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.464
what I can control and what I have to let go

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:35.258
happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:40.343
or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:44.317
When I sat down to write a book about creativity,

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:46.801
I realized that the steps were reversed.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.450
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.054
immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists

00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:59.529
and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:04.841
to these stories, I realized that creativity

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.169
grows out of everyday experiences

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.873
more often than you might think, including

00:03:11.873 --> 00:03:14.793
letting go.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.583
It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.532
That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:24.937
and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.714
from the broken places.

00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:30.361
The best way to learn about anything

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:34.395
is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:39.577
about work and play and about four aspects of life

00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:41.973
that we need to embrace

00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:46.041
in order for our own creativity to flourish.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.057
The first embrace is something that we think,

00:03:48.057 --> 00:03:52.263
"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,

00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:56.258
and that's paying attention to the world around us.

00:03:56.258 --> 00:04:00.713
So many artists speak about needing to be open,

00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:04.153
to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:07.771
you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:11.358
takes all of your focus.

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:15.498
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:20.103
in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,

00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:23.796
and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.668
Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:29.524
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up

00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:32.780
in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.428
that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,

00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:39.980
was traveling folk theater that would come through the town

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.292
and I would go off and see these great battles

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:46.708
of good and evil by two people in a school field

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.244
with no props but with a lot of, you know,

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:52.939
passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.733
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:59.228
the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of

00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:02.758
in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,

00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:07.748
I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:09.655
Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:12.075
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.

00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:14.794
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:20.327
and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl

00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:23.925
with thousands of other people watching this performance,

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.875
but she was ready. She was ready to open up

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.004
to what it sparked in her, and it led her,

00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:32.619
as she said, down this path to become

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.422
an award-winning filmmaker.

00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:38.243
So being open for that experience that might change you

00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:41.176
is the first thing we need to embrace.

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:46.955
Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work

00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:51.827
comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.

00:05:51.827 --> 00:05:55.481
The novelist Richard Ford speaks about

00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:59.523
a childhood challenge that continues to be something

00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:04.283
he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.

00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:07.190
Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.022
through school not really reading more than the minimum,

00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.550
and still to this day can't read silently

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.398
much faster than I can read aloud,

00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:20.174
but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me

00:06:20.174 --> 00:06:23.319
because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.814
I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly

00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:31.346
into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:34.158
and of sentences that are not just the cognitive

00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:37.271
aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.114
what words look like, where paragraphs break,

00:06:39.114 --> 00:06:42.141
where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that

00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.079
I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:49.622
really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences

00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:53.982
as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:57.246
which I think has helped me write sentences.

00:06:57.246 --> 00:07:01.326
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,

00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:06.478
says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.249
He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:13.362
intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.

00:07:13.362 --> 00:07:16.870
He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.934
in language.

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:24.504
Artists also speak about how pushing up against

00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:27.898
the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing

00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:31.246
into what they can't do, helps them focus

00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:34.485
on finding their own voice.

00:07:34.485 --> 00:07:38.630
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.550
as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.829
and he lived in Florence after graduate school.

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:48.398
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,

00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:51.112
where he went to the Prado to see this picture

00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:54.872
by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.

00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:59.976
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"

00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:02.185
and it's the picture of a little princess

00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:05.872
and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over

00:08:05.872 --> 00:08:09.248
that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:12.545
and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen

00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:15.950
of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.725
to look at the picture.

00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:22.792
As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:27.485
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:29.889
and his palette in the other.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.917
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:34.527
and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,

00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:38.522
and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."

00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:40.774
And I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.975
I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:48.413
and painting squares out of randomness,

00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:50.431
and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:53.661
all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.

00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.493
JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might

00:08:56.493 --> 00:09:00.101
have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy

00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:03.869
who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,

00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:07.741
"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back

00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.572
to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:14.375
up to that point, and threw it in a river.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:18.311
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,

00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:21.837
but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,

00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:24.751
and he put together a list of verbs

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.039
— to roll, to crease, to fold —

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:30.735
more than a hundred of them, and as he said,

00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:32.772
he just started playing around. He did these things

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:36.089
to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:39.887
and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing

00:09:39.887 --> 00:09:45.063
to rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"

00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:50.161
he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:53.121
Richard Serra had to let go of painting

00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:56.561
in order to embark on this playful exploration

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.831
that led him to the work that he's known for today:

00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:05.409
huge curves of steel that require our time and motion

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:09.146
to experience. In sculpture,

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:12.417
Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:16.913
He makes us the subject of his art.

00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:20.849
So experience and challenge

00:10:20.849 --> 00:10:24.509
and limitations are all things we need to embrace

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:27.105
for creativity to flourish.

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:30.665
There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:33.025
It's the embrace of loss,

00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:37.315
the oldest and most constant of human experiences.

00:10:37.315 --> 00:10:40.138
In order to create, we have to stand in that space

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:43.938
between what we see in the world and what we hope for,

00:10:43.938 --> 00:10:48.745
looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,

00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:51.319
at war, at death.

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:53.709
That's a tough space to stand in.

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:59.098
The educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"

00:10:59.098 --> 00:11:03.065
tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,

00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:06.105
and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,

00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:09.049
"You can hold that tension like a violin string

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:12.485
and make something beautiful."

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:15.623
That tension resonates in the work of the photographer

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:18.833
Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:22.073
known for his street photography, for capturing a moment

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:25.755
on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs

00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:29.439
of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.121
of light.

00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:35.390
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.388
was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown

00:11:39.388 --> 00:11:42.303
to the World Trade Center, and he photographed

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:46.636
those buildings in every sort of light.

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:50.286
You know where this story goes.

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:52.774
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:57.373
but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site

00:11:57.373 --> 00:11:59.498
of the destruction.

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:01.677
Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,

00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:04.577
I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers

00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:06.775
and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:10.445
and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera

00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:13.445
to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:17.789
and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,

00:12:17.789 --> 00:12:20.229
and said, "Hey, no pictures!"

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:23.453
And it was such a blow that it woke me up,

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:27.509
in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:29.552
And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,

00:12:29.552 --> 00:12:32.643
"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."

00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:34.112
And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member

00:12:34.112 --> 00:12:36.316
of the press?" And she told me,

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:40.410
"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.220
tied up in a little penned-in area,

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.741
and I said, "Well, when do they go in?"

00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:48.223
and she said, "Probably never."

00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:52.714
And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:55.508
probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:57.683
I thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,

00:12:57.683 --> 00:13:01.189
then there'll be no record. We need a record."

00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:03.059
And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:05.346
I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:07.214
see this history disappear."

00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:11.457
JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.970
and got a pass into the World Trade Center site,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.202
where he photographed for nine months almost every day.

00:13:18.202 --> 00:13:21.146
Looking at these photographs today brings back

00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:24.051
the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes

00:13:24.051 --> 00:13:26.048
when I went home to my family at night.

00:13:26.048 --> 00:13:29.466
My office was just a few blocks away.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:33.082
But some of these photographs are beautiful,

00:13:33.082 --> 00:13:36.197
and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz

00:13:36.197 --> 00:13:40.539
to make such beauty out of such devastation?

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:43.905
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful

00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:47.276
and tragic and horrific and everything, but

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:51.572
it was also as, in nature, an enormous event

00:13:51.572 --> 00:13:56.738
that was transformed after the fact into this residue,

00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:58.554
and like many other ruins

00:13:58.554 --> 00:14:02.403
— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —

00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:07.040
and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.913
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,

00:14:08.913 --> 00:14:12.563
and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air

00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:16.594
and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself

00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:20.478
recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature

00:14:20.478 --> 00:14:23.232
and the fact that nature, as time,

00:14:23.232 --> 00:14:26.627
is erasing this wound.

00:14:26.627 --> 00:14:30.461
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.

00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:32.790
It gets further and further away from the day,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.145
and light and seasons temper it in some way,

00:14:37.145 --> 00:14:41.289
and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.

00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:44.773
The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building

00:14:44.773 --> 00:14:50.601
in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim

00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:54.545
across a theater, and it's turning pink,

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:57.648
you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,

00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:00.657
and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water

00:15:00.657 --> 00:15:04.685
is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,

00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.862
and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"

00:15:06.862 --> 00:15:11.063
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,

00:15:11.063 --> 00:15:12.957
you have to take a picture.

00:15:12.957 --> 00:15:16.150
JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:21.950
of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.303
When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much

00:15:25.303 --> 00:15:29.088
I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination

00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:33.671
to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,

00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:35.847
and he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,

00:15:35.847 --> 00:15:38.251
but I think what's more important

00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:41.712
is my passionate optimism."

00:15:41.712 --> 00:15:44.515
The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience

00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:48.005
raised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about

00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:52.743
their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:55.411
my work and where the creativity is there,

00:15:55.411 --> 00:16:00.039
and I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:04.655
with experience and challenge, limits and loss.

00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:06.906
Creativity is essential to all of us,

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:09.559
whether we're scientists or teachers,

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:13.918
parents or entrepreneurs.

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:16.095
I want to leave you with another

00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:19.189
image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:22.159
is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:24.695
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see

00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:28.338
the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.

00:16:28.338 --> 00:16:31.255
But as you can also see, this one did break

00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:33.975
at some point in its hundred years.

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:36.735
But the person who put it back together,

00:16:36.735 --> 00:16:39.299
instead of hiding the cracks,

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:45.015
decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.

00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:49.459
This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,

00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:52.471
than it was when it was first made,

00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:54.701
and we can look at those cracks, because

00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:57.066
they tell the story that we all live,

00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:00.743
of the cycle of creation and destruction,

00:17:00.743 --> 00:17:05.670
of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.669
and making something new.

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:12.223
Thank you. (Applause)
