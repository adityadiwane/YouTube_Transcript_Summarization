00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
thank God for technology --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So these four characters are going to be from that work

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that I've been doing for many years now,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I've interviewed.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So I thought he would be the perfect person

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You see, we also have the technology.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I say, less and less the human touch.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and they should leave the gate there.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And these trains are smooth,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and they're quiet and they're efficient.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now we have humans imitating robots.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And that voice, without losing a beat, says,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I do that to steel my nerves -- and so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And so suddenly they're looking at me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So here I am with the couple, the three of us

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
what is your considered opinion of the human species?'

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
starts laughing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but there's something in him.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and steal them from the woman who owns them,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
he's going to do a terrible thing.'

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So you ask about a defining moment --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
ain't no defining moment in American history for me.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
where trivia becomes news.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
'We're more and more into communications

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and less and less into communication.'

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And that's Studs Terkel.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I like to inspire people.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But since this was called "risk taking,"

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that one person actually came backstage

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and told me to take her out of the show she was in.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
at a conference like this, as a good thing.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But there are certain other connotations to the word "risk,"

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
great, big philosophy kind of an organization --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I went to her and asked her what are the two things

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
when I see the president of my university.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And she said, "And then intellectually,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I don't know enough about the negative imagination.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And September 11th certainly taught us

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that that's a whole area we don't investigate."

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So this piece is about a negative imagination.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and about what a risk can be.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Everything I do is word for word off a tape.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
"I began to learn how to cover it up,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I want everybody to think we were a normal family.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I mean we had all the materialistic things,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but that didn't make my children pain any less;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that didn't make their fears subside.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I failed them dramatically,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
because I allowed it to go on and on and on.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
"But the night that Myesha got killed --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
until one night we came home from getting drugs,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that Myesha was having sex with her little brother

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And so he put her in the bathtub,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and I was in the bedroom with the baby.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And it didn't work, didn't work.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
who was four months old when I came to jail.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I didn't even go and see what was happening.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I just sat there and listened.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And then he put her in the hallway.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And then he told her, get up.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
All around her head was just swollen;

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
her head was about two sizes of its own size.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
"The next morning she was dead.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
He says, 'She won't breathe.'

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I knew immediately that she was dead.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and I put a mirror to her mouth --

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
He said, he said, he said,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that she was missing.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We told a security guard that she was missing,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
though she wasn't missing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And we told the security guard what we had put on her

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
"And then we got the baby and my other child,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and we drove out to, like, I-95.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I was so petrified and so numb,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
My own child, I let that happen to."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Applause)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
When I started this project

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
because my first big show was a show about a race riot.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And so I went to both -- two race riots,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Because this is what I would say

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
It was captured on videotape -- technology --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and it was played all over the world.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They did not, so there were riots.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
ordered by George Bush, Sr.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
whose stores had been burned to the ground.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and questioning what justice is in society.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
"I used to believe America was the best.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I never saw any poor man, any black.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I don't deny that because I am a victim.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I began to really realize that Koreans

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Why? Why do we have to be left out?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
got minimum amount of money to survive.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
"OK. OK? OK. OK.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Well, what about victims' rights?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
He is the model of non-violence, non-violence --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and they would all like to be in his spirit.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And I wonder if that is really justice

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
for them, to get their rights in that way.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
who were destroyed by them.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:30.000
They fought for their rights for over two centuries,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
That's why I understand;

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I could be part of the enjoyment.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I wish that I could live together with black people.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.000
But after the riot, it's too much difference.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
It's still there; it can burst out anytime."

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Mrs. Young-Soon Han.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
(Applause)

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
The other reason that I don't wear shoes

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and get into the feet of somebody,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
walking really in somebody else's shoes.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and I got sidetracked on race relations.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway --

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
and this is on toughness,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
in case anybody needs to know about being tough

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And this is called "Toughness."

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
her family's always saying,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I think that's good luck.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
(Laughter)

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
if you want to get lucky,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
you know, you've got to be around positive people.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
She said, 'Look who she is.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
(Laughter)

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
because I've never been to college,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
like, you know, she wanted me to talk,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I don't think she would even come out here.'

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
"Confidence? Well, I think I ride

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
more out of determination than confidence.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I mean, confidence is like, you know,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
get the horn.'

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
(Laughter)

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And try and determination is the same thing.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
even if you're riding upside down.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Determination's like, you're going to ride

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
till your head hits the back of the dirt.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
and we sleep together.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
I mean, I have my ranch and everything,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I mean, I guess it just be like --

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I guess it be like the day my brother died.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
"Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a --

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And then they had to straighten out my nose,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and went up through my brains

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
and felt like it was coming out the top of my head,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and everybody said that it should have killed me,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
(Laughter)

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and straightened my nose out, I could breathe,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
and I hadn't been able to breathe

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Thank you.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:13.000
(Applause)
