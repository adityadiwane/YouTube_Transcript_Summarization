00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.176
Sadly,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.463
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:24.176
four Americans that are alive

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.248
will be dead through
the food that they eat.

00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.266
My name's Jamie Oliver.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.423
I'm 34 years old.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.176
I'm from Essex in England

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.176
and for the last seven years

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.558
I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way.

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.176
I'm not a doctor;

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.377
I'm a chef,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.923
I don't have expensive equipment

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:51.017
or medicine.

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.286
I use information, education.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.502
I profoundly believe
that the power of food

00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:00.701
has a primal place in our homes

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:05.176
that binds us to the best bits of life.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.490
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:16.755
America, you're at the top of your game.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.187
This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.536
Can I please just see a raise of hands

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.139
for how many of you have
children in this room today?

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:27.263
Put your hands up.

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.973
You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well.

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:33.509
Most of you. OK.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.510
We, the adults of the last
four generations,

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:39.399
have blessed our children with the destiny

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:43.755
of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:50.176
Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.176
because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them.

00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:56.080
Two-thirds of this room,

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:59.080
today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:00.681
You lot, you're all right,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:02.720
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:04.176
(Laughter)

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.176
The statistics of bad health are clear,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.391
very clear.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.633
We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide,

00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:16.176
you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.693
Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:20.629
Right?

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:22.176
(Laughter)

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.176
(Applause)

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.516
Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.128
Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that.

00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:37.439
Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer

00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:40.614
in the United States,
right now, here today.

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:44.762
This is a global problem.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.922
It's a catastrophe.

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:48.414
It's sweeping the world.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:50.651
England is right behind you, as usual.

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:55.620
(Laughter)

00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:57.667
I know they were close,
but not that close.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:02:59.714
We need a revolution.

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:02.017
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.269
India, China,

00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:06.404
all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health.

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:09.176
Think about smoking.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:12.176
It costs way less than obesity now.

00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:17.847
Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills,

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.592
150 billion dollars a year.

00:03:22.274 --> 00:03:24.176
In 10 years, it's set to double:

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.693
300 billion dollars a year.

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:28.093
Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash.

00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:31.233
(Laughter)

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:38.416
I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.695
We need it. The time is now.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.446
We're in a tipping-point moment.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.255
I've been doing this for seven years.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.442
I've been trying in America
for seven years.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:50.350
Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking.

00:03:50.374 --> 00:03:52.176
I went to the eye of the storm.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.129
I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America.

00:03:55.153 --> 00:03:56.192
Or it was last year.

00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.455
We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.362
(Laughter)

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.409
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.930
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.709
your public,

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:12.224
around the statistics
that we've become so used to.

00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:15.604
I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about:

00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:17.248
your public, your children.

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:19.821
I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany.

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:21.518
She's 16 years old.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:25.618
She's got six years to live

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:28.176
because of the food that she's eaten.

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:30.588
She's the third generation of Americans

00:04:30.612 --> 00:04:32.803
that hasn't grown up
within a food environment

00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:35.416
where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.447
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:39.653
She has six years to live.

00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:42.961
She's eating her liver to death.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.096
Stacy, the Edwards family.

00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:47.461
This is a normal family, guys.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.026
Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well;

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.399
she was never taught to cook
at home or at school.

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:54.558
The family's obese.

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:57.303
Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds.

00:04:57.327 --> 00:04:58.995
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.486
The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.018
She's obese before she even gets
to primary school.

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:07.176
Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot.

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:08.505
But you know what?

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.887
Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms,

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.315
And then the second
most important man in her life,

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.863
her uncle, died of obesity,

00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:18.792
and now her step-dad is obese.

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:21.753
You see, the thing is,

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:24.176
obesity and diet-related disease

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:28.849
it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.176
Pastor Steve:

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.637
an inspirational man,

00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:36.175
one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:39.983
He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:42.459
He has to bury the people, OK?

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:44.012
And he's fed up with it.

00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:47.078
He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community.

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:50.335
Come winter, three times
as many people die.

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:51.771
He's sick of it.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.866
This is preventable disease.
Waste of life.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.279
By the way, this is
what they get buried in.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.208
We're not geared up to do this.

00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:03.931
Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious.

00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:05.676
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:08.824
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:10.380
This is our landscape of food.

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:11.761
I need you to understand it.

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:13.849
You've probably heard all this before.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.159
Over the last 30 years,

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:18.016
what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.281
Let's be frank and honest.

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:22.924
Well, modern-day life.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:24.573
Let's start with the Main Street.

00:06:25.327 --> 00:06:28.011
Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.839
The big brands are
some of the most important powers,

00:06:30.863 --> 00:06:32.703
powerful powers, in this country.

00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:34.314
(Sighs)

00:06:34.338 --> 00:06:35.637
Supermarkets as well.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.056
Big companies. Big companies.

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:41.431
Thirty years ago, most of the food

00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:44.176
was largely local and largely fresh.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.559
Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives,

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:50.274
extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story.

00:06:50.298 --> 00:06:53.176
Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem.

00:06:54.877 --> 00:06:56.716
Labeling is a massive problem.

00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:59.700
The labeling in this country
is a disgrace.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.145
The industry wants
to self-police themselves.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.755
What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.045
How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar?

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:14.291
Home.

00:07:16.473 --> 00:07:18.048
The biggest problem with the home

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:23.176
is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.624
what made our society.

00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:27.081
That is not happening anymore.

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.986
And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.987
and as life always evolves,

00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.124
we kind of have
to look at it holistically --

00:07:34.148 --> 00:07:36.536
step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.623
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:42.962
I want to show you a situation

00:07:42.986 --> 00:07:46.227
that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family.

00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:48.818
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

00:07:49.672 --> 00:07:53.705
This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.638
And I need you to know

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:59.232
that this is going to kill
your children early.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.200
How are you feeling?

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.176
Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.003
But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:11.176
and this isn't going to get them there.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:13.505
But I'm killing them.

00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:17.891
JO: Yes you are. You are.

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:19.127
But we can stop that.

00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:24.091
Normal.

00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:27.100
Let's get on schools,

00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:30.176
something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.737
OK, school.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.176
What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.032
School was always invented
to arm us with the tools

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:40.875
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:43.356
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.538
You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.176
But we haven't really evolved it

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.530
to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK?

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:56.641
School food is something

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:59.323
that most kids --
31 million a day, actually --

00:08:59.347 --> 00:09:04.008
have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch,

00:09:04.032 --> 00:09:05.761
180 days of the year.

00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:08.960
So you could say that school
food is quite important, really,

00:09:08.984 --> 00:09:10.570
judging the circumstances.

00:09:10.594 --> 00:09:14.610
(Laughter)

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.176
Before I crack into my rant,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.226
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.297
(Laughter)

00:09:23.321 --> 00:09:25.687
I need to say one thing,
and it's so important

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.418
in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:29.655
in the next three months.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.489
The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America --

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:36.888
I offer myself as their ambassador.

00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:38.398
I'm not slagging them off.

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:40.422
They're doing the best they can do.

00:09:43.088 --> 00:09:44.500
They're doing their best.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.032
But they're doing what they're told,

00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:49.317
and what they're being
told to do is wrong.

00:09:49.636 --> 00:09:52.873
The system is highly run by accountants;

00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:56.974
there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business.

00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:58.029
There's a problem:

00:09:58.053 --> 00:10:01.176
If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.910
and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative,

00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:07.073
you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things.

00:10:07.097 --> 00:10:09.104
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:11.374
the only thing you can do
in these circumstances

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:12.426
is buy cheaper shit.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.780
Now, the reality is,

00:10:13.804 --> 00:10:17.415
the food that your kids get
every day is fast food,

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:18.748
it's highly processed,

00:10:18.772 --> 00:10:21.012
there's not enough
fresh food in there at all.

00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:23.217
You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers,

00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:24.947
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:26.682
there's not enough veggies at all.

00:10:26.706 --> 00:10:28.630
French fries are considered a vegetable.

00:10:28.654 --> 00:10:31.176
Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.532
Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous.

00:10:34.357 --> 00:10:36.097
They have scissors in the classroom,

00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:37.502
but knives and forks? No.

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.922
And the way I look at it is:

00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:41.335
If you don't have knives
and forks in your school,

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:42.898
you're purely endorsing,

00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:45.994
from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld.

00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:47.803
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.417
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.217
it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff.

00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:54.904
(Sighs)

00:10:55.652 --> 00:10:58.629
Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier,

00:10:58.653 --> 00:11:01.088
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.780
We're not teaching our kids.

00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:06.509
There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food,

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:08.326
elementary or secondary school, OK?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.668
We don't teach kids about food, right?

00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:13.121
And this is a little clip
from an elementary school,

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:14.724
which is very common in England.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.729
(Video) Who knows what this is?

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:19.824
Child: Potatoes.

00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:22.436
Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes?

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.681
Do you know what that is?

00:11:23.994 --> 00:11:25.198
Do you know what that is?

00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:26.237
Child: Broccoli?

00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:28.717
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:29.901
Child: Celery.

00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:31.869
JO: No. What do you think this is?

00:11:31.893 --> 00:11:33.377
Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.807
JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense

00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:39.051
of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?"

00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:41.052
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.504
JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.512
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:46.935
then they will never eat it.

00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:50.380
(Laughter)

00:11:50.404 --> 00:11:53.176
JO: Normal. England and America,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.738
England and America.

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:56.905
Guess what fixed that.

00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:58.840
Two one-hour sessions.

00:12:00.411 --> 00:12:03.800
We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period.

00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:10.176
(Applause)

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.221
I want to tell you about something

00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:18.583
that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK?

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:21.178
I want to talk about something
so basic as milk.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.843
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:27.463
Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:29.285
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:30.802
And most kids do.

00:12:30.826 --> 00:12:33.611
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:36.176
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.316
but someone at the milk board

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.010
probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out

00:12:41.034 --> 00:12:42.775
that if you put loads of flavorings,

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.222
colorings and sugar in milk,

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:45.664
more kids will drink it.

00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:47.905
Yeah.

00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:50.374
Obviously now that's going to catch on

00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.184
the apple board is going to work out

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.985
that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.422
Do you know what I mean?

00:12:56.446 --> 00:12:59.493
For me, there isn't any need
to flavor the milk.

00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:01.540
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

00:13:01.564 --> 00:13:03.713
I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients.

00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:04.763
It's in everything.

00:13:04.787 --> 00:13:08.365
Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern-day problems.

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.176
There's our milk. There's our carton.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.449
In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

00:13:14.473 --> 00:13:15.909
and they are having two a day.

00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:17.488
So, let me just show you.

00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:20.594
We've got one kid, here --

00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:26.099
having, you know,
eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.945
You know, there's your week.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.556
There's your month.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.973
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:37.997
just the five years
of elementary school sugar,

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:42.851
just from milk.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.020
Now, I don't know about you guys,

00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:50.861
but judging the circumstances, right,

00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:53.176
any judge in the whole world,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.664
would look at the statistics
and the evidence,

00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:58.973
and they would find any government
of old guilty of child abuse.

00:13:59.528 --> 00:14:00.632
That's my belief.

00:14:00.656 --> 00:14:03.656
(Applause)

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:09.176
(Applause ends)

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.492
Now, if I came up here, and I wish
I could come up here today

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:15.177
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:17.651
you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me.

00:14:18.684 --> 00:14:21.660
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.711
That's the good news.

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:25.711
It's very, very preventable.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.176
So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.318
we need to reboot.

00:14:31.533 --> 00:14:34.176
Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.915
Here is the thing, right,

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:38.176
it cannot just come from one source.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.607
To reboot and make real tangible change,

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.575
real change, so that I could look you
in the white of the eyes

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:46.176
and say, "In 10 years' time,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.176
the history of your children's lives,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.248
happiness -- and let's not forget,
you're clever if you eat well,

00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:53.130
you know you're going to live longer --

00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:56.087
all of that stuff,
it will look different. OK?"

00:14:56.806 --> 00:14:58.512
So, supermarkets.

00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:00.456
Where else do you shop so religiously?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.668
Week in, week out.

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.771
How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket?

00:15:04.795 --> 00:15:05.803
Love them.

00:15:05.827 --> 00:15:07.883
They just sell us what we want. All right.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:12.366
They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket.

00:15:12.882 --> 00:15:14.462
They need to help us shop.

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:18.176
They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.065
for people that are busy.

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:22.058
This is not expensive.

00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:24.963
It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:26.692
in America soon, and quick.

00:15:27.064 --> 00:15:30.041
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:33.790
need to put food education
at the heart of their businesses.

00:15:33.814 --> 00:15:35.694
I know, easier said than done.

00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:37.929
It's the future. It's the only way.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:39.574
Fast food.

00:15:39.598 --> 00:15:42.358
With the fast-food industry

00:15:42.382 --> 00:15:44.176
you know, it's very competitive.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.295
I've had loads
of secret papers and dealings

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:48.037
with fast food restaurants.

00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:49.878
I know how they do it.

00:15:49.902 --> 00:15:52.175
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:54.978
to these hits of sugar,
salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

00:15:55.002 --> 00:15:56.979
and everyone loves them, right?

00:15:57.003 --> 00:16:00.199
So, these guys are going
to be part of the solution.

00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:02.176
But we need to get the government to work

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.248
with all of the fast food purveyors
and the restaurant industry,

00:16:05.272 --> 00:16:07.321
and over a five, six, seven year period

00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:09.664
wean of us off the extreme amounts

00:16:09.688 --> 00:16:13.176
of fat, sugar and all the other
non-food ingredients.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.482
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:18.688
labeling, I said earlier,
is an absolute farce

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:20.123
and has got to be sorted.

00:16:21.503 --> 00:16:22.828
OK, school.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.176
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.176
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.176
from that little precious age of four,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.176
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.051
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:39.176
from local growers on site, OK?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.726
There needs to be a new
standard of fresh, proper food

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.176
for your children, yeah?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.629
(Applause)

00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:51.089
Under the circumstances,
it's profoundly important

00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:53.682
that every single
American child leaves school

00:16:53.706 --> 00:16:55.683
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

00:16:55.707 --> 00:16:57.056
that will save their life.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.279
Life skills.

00:16:59.303 --> 00:17:01.500
(Applause)

00:17:01.524 --> 00:17:04.562
That means that they can be
students, young parents,

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:08.825
and be able to sort of duck and dive
around the basics of cooking,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.952
no matter what recession hits
them next time.

00:17:10.976 --> 00:17:13.358
If you can cook,
recession money doesn't matter.

00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:15.853
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

00:17:17.395 --> 00:17:19.840
The workplace, we haven't
really talked about it.

00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:23.426
You know, it's now time
for corporate responsibility

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.474
to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff.

00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:30.808
The staff are the moms and dads
of America's children.

00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:32.991
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:34.992
I think she'd be quite happy

00:17:35.016 --> 00:17:38.176
if corporate America could start
feeding their staff properly.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.176
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.766
Let's go back to the home.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.030
Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can,

00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:45.127
it's so achievable.

00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:46.893
You can care and be commercial.

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:47.940
Absolutely.

00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:52.959
But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure.

00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:54.959
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:57.117
And for me, it's quite romantic,

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:59.534
but it's about if one person
teaches three people

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:01.176
how to cook something,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.940
and they teach three of their mates,

00:18:02.964 --> 00:18:05.288
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

00:18:05.312 --> 00:18:07.567
and that's the whole
population of America.

00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:11.891
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

00:18:11.915 --> 00:18:14.606
it's about trying to get people to realize

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.614
that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.838
We've got to put back what's been lost.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:21.554
Huntington's Kitchen.

00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:24.466
Huntington, where I made this program,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.077
we've got this prime-time program

00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:29.289
that hopefully will inspire people
to really get on this change.

00:18:29.313 --> 00:18:31.344
I truly believe that change will happen.

00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:33.535
Huntington's Kitchen.
I work with a community.

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.040
I worked in the schools.

00:18:35.064 --> 00:18:37.329
I found local sustainable funding

00:18:37.353 --> 00:18:41.639
to get every single school in the area
from the junk, onto the fresh food:

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.532
six-and-a-half grand per school.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.406
(Applause)

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.926
That's all it takes,
six-and-a-half grand per school.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.353
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

00:18:50.377 --> 00:18:53.252
This can do 5,000 people a year,

00:18:53.276 --> 00:18:55.394
which is 10 percent of their population,

00:18:55.418 --> 00:18:56.799
and it's people on people.

00:18:56.823 --> 00:18:59.124
You know, it's local cooks
teaching local people.

00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:02.734
It's free cooking lessons,
guys, in the Main Street.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.887
This is real, tangible change,
real, tangible change.

00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:10.706
Around America, if we just look back now,

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.133
there is plenty of wonderful
things going on.

00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:15.943
There is plenty of beautiful
things going on.

00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:19.176
There are angels
around America doing great things

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.097
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

00:19:22.121 --> 00:19:24.732
garden set-ups, education --

00:19:24.756 --> 00:19:26.853
there are amazing people
doing this already.

00:19:26.877 --> 00:19:28.806
The problem is they all want to roll out

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.965
what they're doing to the next school,

00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:32.337
but there's no cash.

00:19:33.257 --> 00:19:36.957
We need to recognize the experts
and the angels quickly,

00:19:36.981 --> 00:19:40.176
identify them, and allow them
to easily find the resource

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.440
to keep rolling out
what they're already doing,

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:43.464
and doing well.

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:46.320
Businesses of America need to support

00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:49.176
Mrs. Obama to do the things
that she wants to do.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.599
(Applause)

00:19:55.623 --> 00:19:57.569
And look, I know it's weird

00:19:57.593 --> 00:20:00.176
having an English person
standing here before you

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.641
talking about all this.

00:20:01.665 --> 00:20:03.013
All I can say is: I care.

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:04.991
I'm a father,

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:06.356
and I love this country.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.802
And I believe truly, actually,

00:20:09.826 --> 00:20:12.675
that if change can be made
in this country,

00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:14.882
beautiful things will happen
around the world.

00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:17.041
If America does it,
other people will follow.

00:20:17.065 --> 00:20:18.461
It's incredibly important.

00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:19.905
(Audience) Yeah!

00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:25.560
(Applause)

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:26.862
When I was in Huntington,

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:29.510
trying to get a few things to work
when they weren't,

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:34.845
I thought "If I had a magic wand,
what would I do?"

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.426
And I thought, "You know what?

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.733
I'd just love to be put in front
of some of the most amazing

00:20:39.757 --> 00:20:41.521
movers and shakers in America."

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.528
And a month later, TED phoned me up
and gave me this award.

00:20:46.993 --> 00:20:48.048
I'm here.

00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:51.897
So, my wish.

00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:58.697
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.176
My wish

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.331
is for you to help a strong,
sustainable movement

00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:14.029
to educate every child

00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:16.441
about food,

00:21:16.465 --> 00:21:19.980
to inspire families to cook again,

00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:22.665
and to empower people everywhere

00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:24.212
to fight obesity.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.304
(Applause)

00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:36.496
Thank you.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.520
(Applause continues)
