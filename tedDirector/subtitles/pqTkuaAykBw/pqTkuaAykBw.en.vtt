00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the challenge of dealing with data,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
data that we have to deal with

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
in medical situations.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
It's really a huge challenge for us.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And this is our beast of burden --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
this is a Computer Tomography machine,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
a CT machine.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It's a fantastic device.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It uses X-rays, X-ray beams,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that are rotating very fast around the human body.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
and is generating enormous amounts of information

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that comes out of the machine.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So this is a fantastic machine

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that we can use

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
for improving health care,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
but as I said, it's also a challenge for us.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And the challenge is really found in this picture here.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It's the medical data explosion

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that we're having right now.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
We're facing this problem.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And let me step back in time.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
These machines that came out --

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
they started coming in the 1970s --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
they would scan human bodies,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and they would generate about 100 images

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
of the human body.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to translate that to data slices.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
which is small

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
when you think about the data we can handle today

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
just on normal mobile devices.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
If you translate that to phone books,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
it's about one meter of phone books in the pile.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Looking at what we're doing today

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
with these machines that we have,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
we can, just in a few seconds,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
get 24,000 images out of a body,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
or 800 phone books,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
What's about to happen --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and we're seeing this; it's beginning --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
a technology trend that's happening right now

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And just assume

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that we will be collecting data during five seconds,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and that would correspond to one terabyte of data --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that's 800,000 books

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and 16 kilometers of phone books.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
That's one patient, one data set.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And this is what we have to deal with.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And already today -- this is 25,000 images.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Imagine the days

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
when we had radiologists doing this.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
They would put up 25,000 images,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
There is the problem."

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
They can't do that anymore. That's impossible.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
So what we do is that we put all these slices together.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and then you try to put the slices back together again

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
into a pile of data, into a block of data.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So this is really what we're doing.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
But of course, the block of data

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
just contains the amount of X-ray

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that's been absorbed in each point in the human body.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So what we need to do is to figure out a way

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
of looking at the things we do want to look at

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and make things transparent that we don't want to look at.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
So transforming the data set

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
into something that looks like this.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And this is a challenge.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
This is a huge challenge for us to do that.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
terabytes of data

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and extracting the relevant information.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
I want to look at the heart.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Maybe even find a tumor,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
in some cases.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So this is where this little dear comes into play.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
This is my daughter.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
This is as of 9 a.m. this morning.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
She's playing a computer game.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
She's only two years old,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and she's having a blast.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So she's really the driving force

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
behind the development of graphics-processing units.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
As long as kids are playing computer games,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
graphics is getting better and better and better.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
because that's what I need.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So what's inside of this machine

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
with the medical data.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And you know, going back

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
maybe 10 years in time

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
when I got the funding

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to buy my first graphics computer --

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
it was a huge machine.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I paid about one million dollars for that machine.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
So every month there are new graphics cards coming out,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And you know, for a few hundred bucks

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
you can get these things and put them into your computer,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So this is really what's enabling us

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to deal with the explosion of data in medicine,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
together with some really nifty work

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in terms of algorithms --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
compressing data,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
You can see that this is a full data [set].

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
It's a woman. You can see the hair.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
You can see the individual structures of the woman.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
on the teeth, the metal in the teeth.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
That's where those artifacts are coming from.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
But fully interactively

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
on standard graphics cards on a normal computer,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
I can just put in a clip plane.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And of course all the data is inside,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and I can see that this woman had a problem.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
She had a bleeding up in the brain,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and that's been fixed with a little stent,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And just by changing the functions,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
then I can decide what's going to be transparent

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and what's going to be visible.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
I can look at the skull structure,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and that's where they went in.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So these are fantastic images.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
They're really high resolution,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and they're really showing us what we can do

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
with standard graphics cards today.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Now we have really made use of this,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
into the system.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And one of the applications that we've been working on --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
is the application of virtual autopsies.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
So again, looking at very, very large data sets,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and you saw those full-body scans that we can do.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So this is from a virtual autopsy.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
First you saw the body bag that the body came in,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
then I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles --

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that, with the greatest respect

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
for the people that I'm now going to show --

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
so it's with great respect for the people

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
that have died under violent circumstances

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
that I'm showing these pictures to you.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
In the forensic case --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and this is something

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
just in the part of Sweden that I come from

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that has been undergoing virtual autopsies

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
in the past four years.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
So this will be the typical workflow situation.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
The police will decide --

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
in the evening, when there's a case coming in --

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the body is then transported inside of the body bag

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to our center

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and sometimes the forensic scientist,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
looks at the data that's coming out,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and they have a joint session.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Now looking at a few cases,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
here's one of the first cases that we had.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
You can really see the details of the data set.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
It's very high-resolution,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and it's our algorithms that allow us

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to zoom in on all the details.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And again, it's fully interactive,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
on these systems here.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Without saying too much about this case,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
this is a traffic accident,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
a drunk driver hit a woman.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And the cause of death is the broken neck.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And this women also ended up under the car,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
so she's quite badly beaten up

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
by this injury.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Here's another case, a knifing.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And this is also again showing us what we can do.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
It's very easy to look at metal artifacts

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that we can show inside of the body.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth --

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that's actually the filling of the teeth --

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
but because I've set the functions to show me metal

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and make everything else transparent.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
The person was killed by stabs in the heart,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
but they just deposited the knife

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
by putting it through one of the eyeballs.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Here's another case.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It's very interesting for us

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
to be able to look at things like knife stabbings.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Here you can see that knife went through the heart.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
It's very easy to see how air has been leaking

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
from one part to another part,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
So it really, really helps

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
the criminal investigation

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to establish the cause of death,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to find out who the killer really was.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Here's another case that I think is interesting.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Here you can see a bullet

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
that has lodged just next to the spine on this person.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
so that bullet is actually shining,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and it makes it really easy to find these fragments.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
During a physical autopsy,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
that's actually quite hard to do.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
One of the things that I'm really, really happy

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
to be able to show you here today

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
is our virtual autopsy table.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
It's a touch device that we have developed

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
It actually looks like this,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
just to give you a feeling for what it looks like.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
It really just works like a huge iPhone.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
So we've implemented

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
all the gestures you can do on the table,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So if you were thinking of buying an iPad,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
forget about it. This is what you want instead.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
So it's a very nice little device.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
So if you have the opportunity, please try it out.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
It's really a hands-on experience.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and trying to use it for educational purposes,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
but also, perhaps in the future,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
in a more clinical situation.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
if you want to convey the information to other people

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
about virtual autopsies.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Okay, now that we're talking about touch,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
let me move on to really "touching" data.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And this is a bit of science fiction now,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
so we're moving into really the future.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
but I hope they will in the future.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
It's a little mechanical pen

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And so I can generate a force feedback.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
So when I virtually touch data,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So in this particular situation,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
it's a scan of a living person.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
I have this pen, and I look at the data,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and I move the pen towards the head,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
and all of a sudden I feel resistance.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
So I can feel the skin.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and I can feel the bone structure inside.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
So this is really nice.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And to take that even further, this is a heart.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that just in 0.3 seconds,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
I can scan the whole heart,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and I can do that with time resolution.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
So just looking at this heart,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
I can play back a video here.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
who's been working on this project.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
and he's moving his pen towards the heart,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and the heart is now beating in front of him,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
so he can see how the heart is beating.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
and he's putting it on the heart,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Then he can examine how the heart is moving.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
He can go inside, push inside of the heart,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and really feel how the valves are moving.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
to be able to go inside of the patient's heart

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
before you actually do surgery,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and do that with high-quality resolution data.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
So this is really neat.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Now we're going even further into science fiction.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
And we heard a little bit about functional MRI.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Now this is really an interesting project.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
MRI is using magnetic fields

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and radio frequencies

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
to scan the brain, or any part of the body.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
So what we're really getting out of this

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
is information of the structure of the brain,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but we can also measure the difference

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
and blood that's depleted of oxygen.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
That means that it's possible

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
to map out the activity of the brain.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So this is something that we've been working on.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
going into the MRI system,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
and he was wearing goggles.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
So he could actually see things in the goggles.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And this is a little bit freaky,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
because what Motts is seeing is actually this.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
He's seeing his own brain.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So Motts is doing something here,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and probably he is going like this with his right hand,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
because the left side is activated

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
on the motor cortex.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And then he can see that at the same time.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
These visualizations are brand new.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And this is something that we've been researching for a little while.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
This is another sequence of Motts' brain.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
So he's going "100, 97, 94."

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
And then he's going backwards.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and is lighting up the whole brain.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
You can also see that his visual cortex

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
is activated in the back of the head,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And he's also hearing our instructions

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
when we tell him to do things.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and it's shining through,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
because all of the data is inside this volume.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And in just a second here you will see --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So he's going like this.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
For 20 seconds he's going like that,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
and all of a sudden it lights up up here.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
So we've got motor cortex activation up there.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
So this is really, really nice,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and I think this is a great tool.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And connecting also with the previous talk here,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
this is something that we could use as a tool

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
to really understand

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
how the neurons are working, how the brain is working,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and we can do this with very, very high visual quality

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and very fast resolution.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So this is a lion from the local zoo

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So she came to the center,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
and they sedated her

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and then put her straight into the scanner.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
And I can do very nice images like this.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
I can peel off the layer of the lion.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
I can look inside of it.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And we've been experimenting with this.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And I think this is a great application

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
for the future of this technology,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
because there's very little known about the animal anatomy.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
We can scan all sorts of things,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
all sorts of animals.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
The only problem is to fit it into the machine.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
So here's a bear.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
It was kind of hard to get it in.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And you might want to cuddle this one,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
until you change the functions and look at this.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
So be aware of the bear.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
So with that,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
I'd like to thank all the people

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
who have helped me to generate these images.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
It's a huge effort that goes into doing this,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
gathering the data and developing the algorithms,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
writing all the software.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
So, some very talented people.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and most of these are smarter than I am.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
So thank you very much.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.260
(Applause)
