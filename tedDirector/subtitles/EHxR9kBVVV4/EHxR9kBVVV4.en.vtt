00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I'm here today to give you

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
through what I'm doing now.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I've been doing that for about 10 years.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.260
(Applause)

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
So, very first puzzle,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
sixth grade, my teacher said,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
for the board."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I thought this was a great assignment.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that's been folded just once.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.260
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
One hint: It's not "L."

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
(Laughter)

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
It could be an "L," of course.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So, what else could it be?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Yeah, a lot of you got it.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I created something new, I was very excited

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This was something really original. I got hooked.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and has a right answer.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.260
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
You know, they might have a solution.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Who designed this?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
so we have to hire writers to make movies.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
many puzzles have more than one.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
toys and games --

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
You can create one out of Legos.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You know, you can do anything you want.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Or competitive games like chess where,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.260
but the goal really is to beat another player.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
I consider that puzzles are an art form.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
It's a very small form, like a joke,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
But at best they can reach for something more

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and create a memorable impression.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
The progression of my career that you'll see

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
This is called a figure-ground illusion.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in some of his wonderful prints.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Here we have "Day and Night."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Here is what I did with figure and ground.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
So, here we have "figure" in black.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Here we have "figure" in white.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And it's all part of the same design.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
The background to one is the other.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
It's all "figure."

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
(Laughter)

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
A few other things. Here is my name.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Each letter here is one of these digits.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's the same this way.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.260
who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260
(Laughter)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And recently in Magic magazine

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
This appears in my puzzle calendar.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Now, those are fun to look at.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Now how would you do it interactively?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
For a while I was an interface designer.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And so I think a lot about interaction.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
make the thing on the right.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Now, if you could pick up the black vase,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
it would look like the figure on top.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
If you could pick up the white area,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
it would look like the figure on the bottom.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Well, you can't do that physically,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And here it is, figure-ground.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and make them so they look like the shape on the right.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And this follows the rules I just said:

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
But that is also true of any white area.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
So, here we got the white area in the middle,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and you can pick it up.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
I'll just go one step further.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So, here is --

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
here is a couple pieces. Move them together,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and now this is an active piece.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
You can really get inside somebody's perception

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and have them experience something.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
It's like the old maxim of

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
"you can tell somebody something

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Here is another thing you can do.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
There is a game called Rush Hour.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
besides Rubik's cube.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So, here we have a crowded parking lot

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
with cars all over the place.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
It's made by the company Think Fun.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Okay, so how would you solve this one?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Well, move the blue one out of the way.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
You know? What do you do here?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
The first move is going to be what?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.260
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I wanted to make a sequel.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Now I'm making it available to schools.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And it includes exercises that show you

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
not just how to solve these puzzles,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
but how to extract the principles that will let you solve

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.260
mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
as well as just me creating them.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
I got interested in gene sequencing.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
of the base pairs in DNA?"

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and then you look for overlaps,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
But it takes some persistence.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And when you're done, it makes this design,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.260
which, if you squint, is the word "helix."

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
rather than the other way around.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Which way will these fall?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And depending on which one weighs which amount,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
they'll fall different directions.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
and you get these peculiar pictures.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Gets you thinking about color.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So, we're making smart games for social media.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
First of all, you know, for a long time

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
computer games meant things like "Doom,"

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Well, guess what? That's changing.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
what's called casual games.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And the main players are over 35, and are female.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And it's a game you play with other people.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.260
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Why? Well, we aging Boomers,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
we're exercising. What about our minds?

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.260
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Everybody now considers themselves a creator,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and not just a viewer.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And what does this add up to?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Here is what we see coming.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And we decided to combine our skills.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And we have 24 seconds each.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Where is that?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I'll play as fast as I can.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Okay, so that's the lens.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Anybody?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
That's the corner of the whole thing.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Yeah, I've played this image before,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
but even when I make up my own puzzles --

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and you can put your own images in here.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And we have people all over the world doing that now.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
(Applause)
