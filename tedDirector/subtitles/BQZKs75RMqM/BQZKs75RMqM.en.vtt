00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:14.421
Over the past 10 years,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.014
I've been researching the way
people organize and visualize information.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.825
And I've noticed an interesting shift.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.886
For a long period of time,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.338
we believed in a natural ranking order
in the world around us,

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:33.107
also known as the great chain of being,
or "Scala naturae" in Latin,

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:37.306
a top-down structure that normally starts
with God at the very top,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.735
followed by angels, noblemen,

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.772
common people, animals, and so on.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.274
This idea was actually based
on Aristotle's ontology,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:52.742
which classified all things known to man
in a set of opposing categories,

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.488
like the ones you see behind me.

00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:59.434
But over time, interestingly enough,

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:03.604
this concept adopted
the branching schema of a tree

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:06.501
in what became known
as the Porphyrian tree,

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:10.167
also considered to be
the oldest tree of knowledge.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.412
The branching scheme
of the tree was, in fact,

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:16.385
such a powerful metaphor
for conveying information

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.679
that it became, over time,
an important communication tool

00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:21.977
to map a variety of systems of knowledge.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.731
We can see trees being used
to map morality,

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.604
with the popular tree of virtues
and tree of vices,

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:32.420
as you can see here, with these beautiful
illustrations from medieval Europe.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.913
We can see trees being used
to map consanguinity,

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:38.181
the various blood ties between people.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.206
We can also see trees being used
to map genealogy,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.040
perhaps the most famous archetype
of the tree diagram.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:48.380
I think many of you in the audience
have probably seen family trees.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:52.109
Many of you probably even have
your own family trees drawn in such a way.

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:56.069
We can see trees even mapping
systems of law,

00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.944
the various decrees and rulings
of kings and rulers.

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:05.543
And finally, of course,
also a very popular scientific metaphor,

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.127
we can see trees being used
to map all species known to man.

00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:15.083
And trees ultimately became
such a powerful visual metaphor

00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:17.975
because in many ways,
they really embody this human desire

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.035
for order, for balance,
for unity, for symmetry.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.322
However, nowadays we are really facing
new complex, intricate challenges

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:30.536
that cannot be understood by simply
employing a simple tree diagram.

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:35.279
And a new metaphor is currently emerging,

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:37.453
and it's currently replacing the tree

00:02:37.477 --> 00:02:40.040
in visualizing various
systems of knowledge.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:44.316
It's really providing us with a new lens
to understand the world around us.

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:48.694
And this new metaphor
is the metaphor of the network.

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:52.822
And we can see this shift
from trees into networks

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:54.486
in many domains of knowledge.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.699
We can see this shift in the way
we try to understand the brain.

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:02.491
While before, we used
to think of the brain

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.506
as a modular, centralized organ,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.568
where a given area was responsible
for a set of actions and behaviors,

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:10.331
the more we know about the brain,

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:13.641
the more we think of it
as a large music symphony,

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.275
played by hundreds
and thousands of instruments.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.975
This is a beautiful snapshot
created by the Blue Brain Project,

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.062
where you can see 10,000 neurons
and 30 million connections.

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:28.624
And this is only mapping 10 percent
of a mammalian neocortex.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.975
We can also see this shift in the way
we try to conceive of human knowledge.

00:03:36.062 --> 00:03:39.210
These are some remarkable trees
of knowledge, or trees of science,

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:41.455
by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.809
And Llull was actually the precursor,

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:47.547
the very first one who created
the metaphor of science as a tree,

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:50.539
a metaphor we use
every single day, when we say,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.228
"Biology is a branch of science,"

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:53.405
when we say,

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.362
"Genetics is a branch of science."

00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:59.878
But perhaps the most beautiful of all
trees of knowledge, at least for me,

00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:04.354
was created for the French encyclopedia
by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:07.013
This was really the bastion
of the French Enlightenment,

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:10.862
and this gorgeous illustration
was featured as a table of contents

00:04:10.886 --> 00:04:12.457
for the encyclopedia.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.668
And it actually maps out
all domains of knowledge

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:18.810
as separate branches of a tree.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.199
But knowledge is much more
intricate than this.

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:27.434
These are two maps of Wikipedia
showing the inter-linkage of articles --

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.348
related to history on the left,
and mathematics on the right.

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:33.705
And I think by looking at these maps

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.273
and other ones that have been
created of Wikipedia --

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:39.689
arguably one of the largest rhizomatic
structures ever created by man --

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:43.535
we can really understand
how human knowledge is much more intricate

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.995
and interdependent, just like a network.

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:49.618
We can also see this interesting shift

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:52.342
in the way we map
social ties between people.

00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:55.819
This is the typical organization chart.

00:04:55.843 --> 00:04:58.637
I'm assuming many of you have seen
a similar chart as well,

00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.407
in your own corporations, or others.

00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.916
It's a top-down structure

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.801
that normally starts
with the CEO at the very top,

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:08.785
and where you can drill down all the way
to the individual workmen on the bottom.

00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:14.482
But humans sometimes are, well, actually,
all humans are unique in their own way,

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:19.204
and sometimes you really don't play well
under this really rigid structure.

00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.821
I think the Internet is really changing
this paradigm quite a lot.

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:27.210
This is a fantastic map
of online social collaboration

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:28.863
between Perl developers.

00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:30.975
Perl is a famous programming language,

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.722
and here, you can see
how different programmers

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:37.573
are actually exchanging files,
and working together on a given project.

00:05:37.597 --> 00:05:41.775
And here, you can notice that this is
a completely decentralized process --

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.955
there's no leader in this organization,

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.136
it's a network.

00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:51.042
We can also see this interesting shift
when we look at terrorism.

00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:54.717
One of the main challenges
of understanding terrorism nowadays

00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:58.471
is that we are dealing with
decentralized, independent cells,

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:01.317
where there's no leader
leading the whole process.

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:05.816
And here, you can actually see
how visualization is being used.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.497
The diagram that you see behind me

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.339
shows all the terrorists involved
in the Madrid attack in 2004.

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.869
And what they did here is,
they actually segmented the network

00:06:14.893 --> 00:06:16.392
into three different years,

00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:19.458
represented by the vertical layers
that you see behind me.

00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:21.451
And the blue lines tie together

00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:25.093
the people that were present
in that network year after year.

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:27.145
So even though there's no leader per se,

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.804
these people are probably the most
influential ones in that organization,

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:32.836
the ones that know more about the past,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.737
and the future plans and goals
of this particular cell.

00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:40.238
We can also see this shift
from trees into networks

00:06:40.262 --> 00:06:43.253
in the way we classify
and organize species.

00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:48.074
The image on the right
is the only illustration

00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:51.210
that Darwin included
in "The Origin of Species,"

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:53.495
which Darwin called the "Tree of Life."

00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:56.983
There's actually a letter
from Darwin to the publisher,

00:06:57.007 --> 00:06:59.663
expanding on the importance
of this particular diagram.

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.329
It was critical for Darwin's
theory of evolution.

00:07:03.408 --> 00:07:06.975
But recently, scientists discovered
that overlaying this tree of life

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.434
is a dense network of bacteria,

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.619
and these bacteria
are actually tying together

00:07:11.643 --> 00:07:13.815
species that were completely
separated before,

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:16.919
to what scientists are now calling
not the tree of life,

00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:19.799
but the web of life, the network of life.

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:24.003
And finally, we can really
see this shift, again,

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.451
when we look at ecosystems
around our planet.

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:30.765
No more do we have these simplified
predator-versus-prey diagrams

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.236
we have all learned at school.

00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.190
This is a much more accurate
depiction of an ecosystem.

00:07:36.214 --> 00:07:39.118
This is a diagram created
by Professor David Lavigne,

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:42.642
mapping close to 100 species
that interact with the codfish

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.617
off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.

00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:50.181
And I think here, we can really understand
the intricate and interdependent nature

00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:52.728
of most ecosystems
that abound on our planet.

00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:58.086
But even though recent,
this metaphor of the network,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.213
is really already adopting
various shapes and forms,

00:08:01.237 --> 00:08:03.700
and it's almost becoming
a growing visual taxonomy.

00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:06.371
It's almost becoming
the syntax of a new language.

00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:09.028
And this is one aspect
that truly fascinates me.

00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:12.211
And these are actually
15 different typologies

00:08:12.235 --> 00:08:14.370
I've been collecting over time,

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:18.416
and it really shows the immense
visual diversity of this new metaphor.

00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:20.223
And here is an example.

00:08:20.818 --> 00:08:24.751
On the very top band,
you have radial convergence,

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:28.714
a visualization model that has become
really popular over the last five years.

00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:33.552
At the top left, the very first project
is a gene network,

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:37.585
followed by a network
of IP addresses -- machines, servers --

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:40.581
followed by a network of Facebook friends.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.748
You probably couldn't find
more disparate topics,

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:47.566
yet they are using the same metaphor,
the same visual model,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.196
to map the never-ending complexities
of its own subject.

00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:55.669
And here are a few more examples
of the many I've been collecting,

00:08:55.693 --> 00:08:58.431
of this growing visual
taxonomy of networks.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:03.113
But networks are not just
a scientific metaphor.

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:09.733
As designers, researchers, and scientists
try to map a variety of complex systems,

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:12.570
they are in many ways influencing
traditional art fields,

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.996
like painting and sculpture,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.013
and influencing many different artists.

00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:20.760
And perhaps because networks have
this huge aesthetical force to them --

00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:22.742
they're immensely gorgeous --

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:24.822
they are really becoming a cultural meme,

00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:29.171
and driving a new art movement,
which I've called "networkism."

00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:33.752
And we can see this influence
in this movement in a variety of ways.

00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:35.569
This is just one of many examples,

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:38.318
where you can see this influence
from science into art.

00:09:38.342 --> 00:09:41.213
The example on your left side
is IP-mapping,

00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:44.896
a computer-generated map of IP addresses;
again -- servers, machines.

00:09:45.253 --> 00:09:46.458
And on your right side,

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:51.100
you have "Transient Structures
and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.218
using oil and enamel on canvas.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.975
And here are a few more
paintings by Sharon Molloy,

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:58.931
some gorgeous, intricate paintings.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.681
And here's another example
of that interesting cross-pollination

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.109
between science and art.

00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:08.140
On your left side,
you have "Operation Smile."

00:10:08.164 --> 00:10:11.053
It is a computer-generated map
of a social network.

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:14.803
And on your right side,
you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:16.913
using only graphite on paper.

00:10:17.374 --> 00:10:20.891
Emma McNally is one of the main
leaders of this movement,

00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:23.484
and she creates these striking,
imaginary landscapes,

00:10:23.508 --> 00:10:28.173
where you can really notice the influence
from traditional network visualization.

00:10:30.324 --> 00:10:33.331
But networkism doesn't happen
only in two dimensions.

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:35.633
This is perhaps
one of my favorite projects

00:10:35.657 --> 00:10:37.062
of this new movement.

00:10:37.086 --> 00:10:39.720
And I think the title really
says it all -- it's called:

00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:41.911
"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:45.267
Like Droplets Along the Strands
of a Spider's Web."

00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:49.696
And I just find this particular project
to be immensely powerful.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
It was created by Tomás Saraceno,

00:10:51.704 --> 00:10:54.402
and he occupies these large spaces,

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:57.768
creates these massive installations
using only elastic ropes.

00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:01.609
As you actually navigate that space
and bounce along those elastic ropes,

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:06.208
the entire network kind of shifts,
almost like a real organic network would.

00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:09.446
And here's yet another example

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.859
of networkism taken
to a whole different level.

00:11:12.303 --> 00:11:15.516
This was created
by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.295
in a piece called "In Silence."

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:23.189
And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno,
fills these rooms with this dense network,

00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:26.975
this dense web of elastic ropes
and black wool and thread,

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:29.758
sometimes including objects,
as you can see here,

00:11:29.782 --> 00:11:32.804
sometimes even including people,
in many of her installations.

00:11:35.374 --> 00:11:38.065
But networks are also
not just a new trend,

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.453
and it's too easy for us
to dismiss it as such.

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:44.636
Networks really embody
notions of decentralization,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.794
of interconnectedness, of interdependence.

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:50.779
And this new way of thinking is critical

00:11:50.803 --> 00:11:54.533
for us to solve many of the complex
problems we are facing nowadays,

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:56.398
from decoding the human brain,

00:11:56.422 --> 00:11:58.825
to understanding
the vast universe out there.

00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:04.235
On your left side, you have a snapshot
of a neural network of a mouse --

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:06.679
very similar to our own
at this particular scale.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.466
And on your right side, you have
the Millennium Simulation.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.238
It was the largest
and most realistic simulation

00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:15.052
of the growth of cosmic structure.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.006
It was able to recreate the history
of 20 million galaxies

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.120
in approximately 25 terabytes of output.

00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:25.494
And coincidentally or not,

00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:27.391
I just find this particular comparison

00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:30.118
between the smallest scale
of knowledge -- the brain --

00:12:30.142 --> 00:12:32.971
and the largest scale of knowledge --
the universe itself --

00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:35.272
to be really quite striking
and fascinating.

00:12:35.807 --> 00:12:38.441
Because as Bruce Mau once said,

00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:40.877
"When everything is connected
to everything else,

00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:43.298
for better or for worse,
everything matters."

00:12:43.322 --> 00:12:44.473
Thank you so much.

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:48.299
