00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Everybody talks about happiness these days.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I had somebody count the number of books

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
among researchers.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Everybody would like to make people happier.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.260
But in spite of all this flood of work,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
there are several cognitive traps

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
about happiness.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.260
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
The first of these traps

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
It turns out that the word "happiness"

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
is just not a useful word anymore,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
because we apply it to too many different things.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
but by and large,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
this is something that we'll have to give up

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
of what well-being is.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and being happy about your life

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
or happy with your life.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And those are two very different concepts,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And the third is the focusing illusion,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that affects well-being

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
without distorting its importance.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
There's just no way of getting it right.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Now, I'd like to start with an example

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
after one of my lectures reported a story,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and that was a story --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and it was absolutely glorious music

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and at the very end of the recording,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
there was a dreadful screeching sound.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And then he added, really quite emotionally,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
it ruined the whole experience.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
But it hadn't.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
He had had the experience.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
They counted for nothing

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
because he was left with a memory;

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
the memory was ruined,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
What this is telling us, really,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
in terms of two selves.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
There is an experiencing self,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
who lives in the present

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and knows the present,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
is capable of re-living the past,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
but basically it has only the present.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.260
you know, when the doctor asks,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And then there is a remembering self,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and maintains the story of our life,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and it's the one that the doctor approaches

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
in asking the question,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
"How have you been feeling lately?"

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Those are two very different entities,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
the experiencing self and the remembering self,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
about the notion of happiness.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Now, the remembering self

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
is a storyteller.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
it starts immediately.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Our memory tells us stories,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
is a story.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And let me begin with one example.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
This is an old study.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Here are two patients,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
those are their recordings.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
And it's a very easy question.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
his colonoscopy was longer,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Patient B had, and more.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But now there is another question:

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And here is a surprise.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
The surprise is that Patient A

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
than Patient B.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And the one that is worse

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
it's a bad story.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
How do we know that?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and much later, too,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Now this is a direct conflict

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
clearly, B had a worse time.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and it has been done, and it does work --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.260
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
That will cause the patient

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
to suffer, but just a little

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and much less than before.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
you have made the experiencing self

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
of Patient A worse off,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
a lot better off,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
because now you have endowed Patient A

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
with a better story

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
about his experience.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
What defines a story?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And that is true of the stories

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
that memory delivers for us,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
What defines a story are changes,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
significant moments and endings.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Endings are very, very important

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and, in this case, the ending dominated.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Now, the experiencing self

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
lives its life continuously.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
It has moments of experience, one after the other.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And the answer is really straightforward:

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
They are lost forever.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
is said to be about three seconds long;

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that means that, you know,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
most of them don't leave a trace.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Most of them are completely ignored

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
by the remembering self.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And yet, somehow you get the sense

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
that they should count,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that what happens during these moments of experience

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
is our life.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
It's the finite resource that we're spending

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
while we're on this earth.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And how to spend it

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
would seem to be relevant,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
but that is not the story

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
that the remembering self keeps for us.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
So we have the remembering self

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and the experiencing self,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
and they're really quite distinct.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
The biggest difference between them

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
is in the handling of time.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
if you have a vacation,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and the second week is just as good as the first,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
then the two-week vacation

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is barely better than the one-week vacation

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
because there are no new memories added.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
You have not changed the story.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And in this way,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
time is actually the critical variable

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
that distinguishes a remembering self

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
from an experiencing self;

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
time has very little impact on the story.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Now, the remembering self does more

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
than remember and tell stories.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It is actually the one that makes decisions

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and is deciding which of them to choose,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
then the one that chooses

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
The experiencing self

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
has no voice in this choice.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
We actually don't choose between experiences,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
we choose between memories of experiences.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And even when we think about the future,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
We think of our future

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
as anticipated memories.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And basically you can look at this,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and you can think of the remembering self

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
sort of dragging the experiencing self

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
through experiences that

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
the experiencing self doesn't need.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
I have that sense that

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
when we go on vacations

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
this is very frequently the case;

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
that is, we go on vacations,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
to a very large extent,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
in the service of our remembering self.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
That is one of the explanations

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that is given for the dominance

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
of the remembering self.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and I think of it relatively often,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
And I probably have consumed

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
with the 600 pictures in it,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
I would have spent another hour.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Now, that is three weeks,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and that is at most an hour and a half.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
There seems to be a discrepancy.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
but even if you do more of this,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
there is a genuine question:

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Why do we put so much weight on memory

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
So I want you to think

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
about a thought experiment.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Imagine that for your next vacation,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
you know that at the end of the vacation

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
all your pictures will be destroyed,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and you'll get an amnesic drug

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
so that you won't remember anything.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And if you would choose a different vacation,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
there is a conflict between your two selves,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
and it's actually not at all obvious, because

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
if you think in terms of time,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
then you get one answer,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and if you think in terms of memories,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
you might get another answer.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Why do we pick the vacations we do

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
is a problem that confronts us

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
with a choice between the two selves.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Now, the two selves

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
bring up two notions of happiness.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
There are really two concepts of happiness

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
that we can apply, one per self.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
in the experiencing self's life?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And they're all -- happiness for moments

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
is a fairly complicated process.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
What are the emotions that can be measured?

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And, by the way, now we are capable

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
of getting a pretty good idea

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
it's a completely different thing.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
This is not about how happily a person lives.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.260
when that person thinks about her life.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Very different notion.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
is going to mess up the study of happiness,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.260
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
in precisely this way.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
The distinction between the

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
happiness of the experiencing self

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and the satisfaction of the remembering self

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
has been recognized in recent years,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
The Gallup Organization has a world poll

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
where more than half a million people

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
have been asked questions

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
about what they think of their life

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and about their experiences,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and there have been other efforts along those lines.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So in recent years, we have begun to learn

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
about the happiness of the two selves.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And the main lesson I think that we have learned

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
is they are really different.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.260
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and that really doesn't teach you much

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
about how happily they're living their life,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and vice versa.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
the correlation is about .5.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
What that means is if you met somebody,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
how much would you know about his height?

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Well, you would know something about his height,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
You have that much uncertainty.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.260
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
you have a lot of uncertainty

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
about how happy they are

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
with their experiencing self.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
So the correlation is low.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
We know something about what controls

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
satisfaction of the happiness self.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
We know that money is very important,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
goals are very important.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.260
We know that happiness is mainly

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
being satisfied with people that we like,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
spending time with people that we like.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
you are going to end up

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
doing very different things.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
The bottom line of what I've said here

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is that we really should not think of happiness

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
as a substitute for well-being.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
It is a completely different notion.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Now, very quickly,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.260
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is that we do not attend to the same things

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
when we think about life, and we actually live.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.260
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
you are not going to get to the correct answer.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
When you ask that question,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
you think people must be happier in California

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
if, say, you live in Ohio.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
(Laughter)

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And what happens is

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.260
when you think about living in California,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
you are thinking of the contrast

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
between California and other places,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and that contrast, say, is in climate.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Well, it turns out that climate

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
is not very important to the experiencing self

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
and it's not even very important to the reflective self

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
that decides how happy people are.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
you may end up -- some people may end up

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
moving to California.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Well, their experiencing self

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
is not going to get happier.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
We know that.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
because, when they think about it,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.260
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
and they will feel they made the right decision.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
It is very difficult

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
to think straight about well-being,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
and I hope I have given you a sense

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
of how difficult it is.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Thank you.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
(Applause)

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
Thank you so much.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.260
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
came out of that Gallup survey.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
Is that something you can share

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
since you do have a few moments left now?

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
We found that with respect to the happiness

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
of the experiencing self.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:32.260
When we looked at how feelings,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
vary with income.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
And it turns out that, below an income

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
so it's a large representative sample --

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
CA: 60,000.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
DK: 60,000.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
(Laughter)

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.260
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
Clearly, what is happening is

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
money does not buy you experiential happiness,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
and we can measure that misery

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
very, very clearly.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
you get a different story.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.260
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
That does not hold for emotions.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.260
If people took seriously that finding,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
I mean, it seems to turn upside down

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
everything we believe about, like for example,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
taxation policy and so forth.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
would take a finding like that seriously

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
and run public policy based on it?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
DK: You know I think that there is recognition

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
of the role of happiness research in public policy.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
no question about that,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
but in the U.K., it is happening,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
and in other countries it is happening.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
People are recognizing that they ought

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
to be thinking of happiness

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
when they think of public policy.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
It's going to take a while,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
and people are going to debate

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
whether they want to study experience happiness,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
or whether they want to study life evaluation,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
How to enhance happiness

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.260
goes very different ways depending on how you think,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
and whether you think of the remembering self

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
or you think of the experiencing self.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.260
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
In the United States, efforts are being made

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
to measure the experience happiness of the population.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.260
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
part of national statistics.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.260
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
the most interesting policy discussion to track

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
over the next few years.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.260
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.260
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
