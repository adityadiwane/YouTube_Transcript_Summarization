00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.081
The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.850
Faster, Higher, Stronger.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.790
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.946
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:28.262
ran two hours and eight minutes.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:29.882
Had he been racing against the winner

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.348
of the 1904 Olympic marathon,

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.681
he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.453
Now we all have this feeling

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.043
that we're somehow just getting better

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:41.383
as a human race, inexorably progressing,

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:43.524
but it's not like we've evolved into a new species

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:44.990
in a century.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.598
So what's going on here?

00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:48.959
I want to take a look at what's really behind

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:51.649
this march of athletic progress.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.946
In 1936, Jesse Owens

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:56.283
held the world record in the 100 meters.

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:58.990
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.436
in the world championships of the 100 meters,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.910
when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.318
Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.197
That's a lot in sprinter land.

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:10.700
To give you a sense of how much it is,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.658
I want to share with you a demonstration

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.670
conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.835
Now picture the stadium last year

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.464
at the world championships of the 100 meters:

00:01:20.464 --> 00:01:22.563
thousands of fans waiting with baited breath

00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:26.037
to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;

00:01:26.037 --> 00:01:28.912
flashbulbs popping as the
nine fastest men in the world

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:31.475
coil themselves into their blocks.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:32.606
And I want you to pretend

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:34.945
that Jesse Owens is in that race.

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:38.190
Now close your eyes for a
second and picture the race.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.882
Bang! The gun goes off.

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:41.950
An American sprinter jumps out to the front.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.900
Usain Bolt starts to catch him.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.521
Usain Bolt passes him, and as
the runners come to the finish,

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:48.198
you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.

00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:49.875
(Beeps)

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.980
That's the entire finish of the race.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.360
You can open your eyes now.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.970
That first beep was Usain Bolt.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.284
That last beep was Jesse Owens.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:01.461
Listen to it again.

00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:03.179
(Beeps)

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.279
When you think of it like that,

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.550
it's not that big a difference, is it?

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.407
And then consider that Usain Bolt started

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:11.170
by propelling himself out of blocks

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.509
down a specially fabricated carpet

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.265
designed to allow him to travel

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:17.381
as fast as humanly possible.

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.052
Jesse Owens, on the other hand,

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.643
ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.880
and that soft surface stole far more energy

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.657
from his legs as he ran.

00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:29.620
Rather than blocks, Jesse
Owens had a gardening trowel

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.447
that he had to use to dig holes
in the cinders to start from.

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:35.551
Biomechanical analysis of the speed

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.095
of Owens' joints shows that had been running

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:39.609
on the same surface as Bolt,

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.120
he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.439
he would have been within one stride.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.181
Rather than the last beep,

00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:49.121
Owens would have been the second beep.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.172
Listen to it again.

00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:52.910
(Beeps)

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.293
That's the difference track
surface technology has made,

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:57.572
and it's done it throughout the running world.

00:02:57.572 --> 00:02:59.303
Consider a longer event.

00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:02.266
In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.443
became the first man to run
under four minutes in the mile.

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:08.493
Nowadays, college kids do that every year.

00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:11.046
On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:12.788
As of the end of last year,

00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:15.155
1,314 men

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:17.370
had run under four minutes in the mile,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.820
but like Jesse Owens,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.562
Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders

00:03:21.562 --> 00:03:23.386
that stole far more energy from his legs

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:25.749
than the synthetic tracks of today.

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.249
So I consulted biomechanics experts

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.813
to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:31.071
than synthetic tracks,

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.471
and their consensus that it's
one and a half percent slower.

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:37.758
So if you apply a one and a half
percent slowdown conversion

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.944
to every man who ran his sub-four mile

00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:41.388
on a synthetic track,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.084
this is what happens.

00:03:43.084 --> 00:03:45.413
Only 530 are left.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.810
If you look at it from that perspective,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.130
fewer than ten new men per [year]

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.613
have joined the sub-four mile club

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.915
since Sir Roger Bannister.

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:55.982
Now, 530 is a lot more than one,

00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:57.498
and that's partly because
there are many more people

00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:00.012
training today and they're training more intelligently.

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:02.240
Even college kids are professional in their training

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.766
compared to Sir Roger Bannister,

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.225
who trained for 45 minutes at a time

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.315
while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.718
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:12.429
in three in a half hours,

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.566
that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.598
while he ran along the course.

00:04:16.598 --> 00:04:19.221
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.

00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:21.284
(Laughter)

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:22.972
Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.446
about performance-enhancing drugs as well,

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.717
and that's made a difference
in some sports at some times,

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:30.004
but technology has made a difference in all sports,

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.553
from faster skis to lighter shoes.

00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:35.693
Take a look at the record for
the 100-meter freestyle swim.

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:38.340
The record is always trending downward,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.090
but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.011
This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:45.240
of the flip turn.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.269
Rather than stopping and turning around,

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.113
athletes could somersault under the water

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:51.631
and get going right away in the opposite direction.

00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:54.423
This second cliff, the introduction of gutters

00:04:54.423 --> 00:04:55.955
on the side of the pool

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.512
that allows water to splash off,

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:58.799
rather than becoming turbulence

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.046
that impedes the swimmers as they race.

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:02.685
This final cliff,

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:03.871
the introduction of full-body

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.768
and low-friction swimsuits.

00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:09.457
Throughout sports, technology has
changed the face of performance.

00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:12.233
In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.557
for the longest distance cycled in one hour

00:05:14.557 --> 00:05:18.605
at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.853
Now that record improved and improved

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:23.872
as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic

00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:25.486
all the way until 1996,

00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:29.921
when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,

00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:32.150
nearly five miles farther

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.295
than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.

00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:38.718
But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:41.226
decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:44.298
had to do so with essentially the same equipment

00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:46.963
that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:49.218
Where does the record stand today?

00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:52.840
30 miles, 4,657 feet,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.950
a grand total of 883 feet

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.726
farther than Eddy Merckx cycled

00:05:57.726 --> 00:05:59.427
more than four decades ago.

00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:01.808
Essentially the entire improvement in this record

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:03.860
was due to technology.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.030
Still, technology isn't the only
thing pushing athletes forward.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.481
While indeed we haven't evolved

00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.198
into a new species in a century,

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.158
the gene pool within competitive sports

00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:14.550
most certainly has changed.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.459
In the early half of the 20th century,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.144
physical education instructors and coaches

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.416
had the idea that the average body type

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:22.787
was the best for all athletic endeavors:

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:26.110
medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.082
And this showed in athletes' bodies.

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:30.335
In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:34.050
and average elite shot-putter
were the same exact size.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.960
But as that idea started to fade away,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.036
as sports scientists and coaches realized that

00:06:38.036 --> 00:06:39.628
rather than the average body type,

00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:41.540
you want highly specialized bodies

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.870
that fit into certain athletic niches,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.175
a form of artificial selection took place,

00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:48.798
a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,

00:06:48.798 --> 00:06:51.458
and athletes' bodies became
more different from one another.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:55.414
Today, rather than the same size
as the average elite high jumper,

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:56.428
the average elite shot-putter

00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:58.079
is two and a half inches taller

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:01.168
and 130 pounds heavier.

00:07:01.168 --> 00:07:03.087
And this happened throughout the sports world.

00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:05.752
In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph

00:07:05.752 --> 00:07:08.280
one data point for each of two dozen sports

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.565
in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.050
There's some dispersal,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.060
but it's kind of grouped
around that average body type.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.639
Then that idea started to go away,

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:19.340
and at the same time, digital technology --

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.547
first radio, then television and the Internet --

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:23.924
gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:27.103
a ticket to consume elite sports performance.

00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:30.976
The financial incentives and fame and glory
afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:35.169
and it tipped toward the tiny
upper echelon of performance.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.596
It accelerated the artificial
selection for specialized bodies.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:40.224
And if you plot a data point for these same

00:07:40.224 --> 00:07:44.106
two dozen sports today, it looks like this.

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:45.533
The athletes' bodies have gotten

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.727
much more different from one another.

00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:49.836
And because this chart looks like the charts

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.567
that show the expanding universe,

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.027
with the galaxies flying away from one another,

00:07:54.027 --> 00:07:55.671
the scientists who discovered it call it

00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.960
"The Big Bang of Body Types."

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.368
In sports where height is prized, like basketball,

00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:03.158
the tall athletes got taller.

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:06.264
In 1983, the National Basketball Association

00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:07.587
signed a groundbreaking agreement

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.639
making players partners in the league,

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.189
entitled to shares of ticket revenues

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.096
and television contracts.

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:15.299
Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:16.495
wanted to be,

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.341
and teams started scouring the globe

00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.621
for the bodies that could
help them win championships.

00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.364
Almost overnight,

00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:23.742
the proportion of men in the NBA

00:08:23.742 --> 00:08:25.634
who are at least seven feet tall doubled

00:08:25.634 --> 00:08:27.399
to 10 percent.

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:29.422
Today, one in 10 men in the NBA

00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:31.604
is at least seven feet tall,

00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:33.753
but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare

00:08:33.753 --> 00:08:35.272
in the general population --

00:08:35.272 --> 00:08:37.922
so rare that if you know an American man

00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:39.327
between the ages of 20 and 40

00:08:39.327 --> 00:08:41.463
who is at least seven feet tall,

00:08:41.463 --> 00:08:43.235
there's a 17 percent chance

00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:45.040
he's in the NBA right now.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.978
(Laughter)

00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:50.854
That is, find six honest seven footers,

00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:54.084
one is in the NBA right now.

00:08:54.084 --> 00:08:56.913
And that's not the only way that
NBA players' bodies are unique.

00:08:56.913 --> 00:08:59.528
This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"

00:08:59.528 --> 00:09:00.951
the ideal proportions,

00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:02.950
with arm span equal to height.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.458
My arm span is exactly equal to my height.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:07.594
Yours is probably very nearly so.

00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:09.756
But not the average NBA player.

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:12.563
The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",

00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:14.874
with arms that are seven feet long.

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:17.672
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,

00:09:17.672 --> 00:09:19.950
they are ludicrously long.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.955
Had Leonardo wanted to draw

00:09:20.955 --> 00:09:22.930
the Vitruvian NBA Player,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.903
he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,

00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:27.685
not a circle and a square.

00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:29.850
So in sports where large size is prized,

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.921
the large athletes have gotten larger.

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.900
Conversely, in sports where
diminutive stature is an advantage,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.117
the small athletes got smaller.

00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:38.780
The average elite female gymnast

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.543
shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average

00:09:41.543 --> 00:09:42.880
over the last 30 years,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.995
all the better for their power-to-weight ratio

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:46.765
and for spinning in the air.

00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:48.127
And while the large got larger

00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:49.491
and the small got smaller,

00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:51.919
the weird got weirder.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.469
The average length of the forearm

00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:55.220
of a water polo player in relation

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.077
to their total arm got longer,

00:09:57.077 --> 00:09:59.206
all the better for a forceful throwing whip.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.933
And as the large got larger,

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.303
small got smaller, and the weird weirder.

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.496
In swimming, the ideal body type

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:07.391
is a long torso and short legs.

00:10:07.391 --> 00:10:09.330
It's like the long hull of a canoe

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.036
for speed over the water.

00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:12.801
And the opposite is advantageous in running.

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:14.816
You want long legs and a short torso.

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:17.012
And this shows in athletes' bodies today.

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:18.607
Here you see Michael Phelps,

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:20.071
the greatest swimmer in history,

00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:22.940
standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.927
the world record holder in the mile.

00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:27.744
These men are seven inches different in height,

00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:28.946
but because of the body types

00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:30.809
advantaged in their sports,

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:33.197
they wear the same length pants.

00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:34.691
Seven inches difference in height,

00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:37.211
these men have the same length legs.

00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:39.169
Now in some cases, the search for bodies

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:41.142
that could push athletic performance forward

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.785
ended up introducing into the competitive world

00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:46.924
populations of people that weren't
previously competing at all,

00:10:46.924 --> 00:10:49.676
like Kenyan distance runners.

00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:53.006
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.384
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe

00:10:55.384 --> 00:10:57.484
as being great marathoners.

00:10:57.484 --> 00:10:59.579
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:01.376
of the Kenyan population

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.545
but the vast majority of elite runners.

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:04.851
And they happen, on average,

00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:06.955
to have a certain unique physiology:

00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:08.036
legs that are very long

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:10.574
and very thin at their extremity,

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.992
and this is because they have their ancestry

00:11:11.992 --> 00:11:13.427
at very low latitude

00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:15.842
in a very hot and dry climate,

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.732
and an evolutionary adaptation to that

00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:18.690
is limbs that are very long

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.209
and very thin at the extremity

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:21.983
for cooling purposes.

00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:25.012
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,

00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:26.854
to increase surface area compared to volume

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.796
to let heat out,

00:11:28.796 --> 00:11:30.309
and because the leg is like a pendulum,

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:31.966
the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,

00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:34.745
the more energy-efficient it is to swing.

00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:37.339
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:40.066
consider that 17 American men in history

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.695
have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes

00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:43.984
in the marathon.

00:11:43.984 --> 00:11:47.031
That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.

00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:49.966
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:52.060
(Laughter)

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.881
That's from a source population the size

00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:56.708
of metropolitan Atlanta.

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:58.282
Still, even changing technology

00:11:58.282 --> 00:11:59.888
and the changing gene pool in sports

00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:02.361
don't account for all of the changes in performance.

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:05.251
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.

00:12:05.251 --> 00:12:06.620
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.892
an electrical shock

00:12:07.892 --> 00:12:10.215
and they're thrown across a room?

00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:11.786
There's no explosion there.

00:12:11.786 --> 00:12:13.024
What's happening when that happens is that

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.486
the electrical impulse is causing

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:16.616
all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,

00:12:16.616 --> 00:12:19.210
and they're throwing themselves across the room.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.107
They're essentially jumping.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.284
That's the power

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:24.233
that's contained in the human body.

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:26.460
But normally we can't access nearly all of it.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.479
Our brain acts as a limiter,

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:30.774
preventing us from accessing
all of our physical resources,

00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:32.015
because we might hurt ourselves,

00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:33.707
tearing tendons or ligaments.

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:36.730
But the more we learn about
how that limiter functions,

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.610
the more we learn how we can push it back

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.050
just a bit,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.482
in some cases by convincing the brain

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:44.256
that the body won't be in mortal danger

00:12:44.256 --> 00:12:46.066
by pushing harder.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:47.685
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:49.257
serve as a great example.

00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:51.379
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:52.794
to human health,

00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:54.212
but now we realize

00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:55.308
that we have all these traits

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:58.412
that are perfect for ultra-endurance:

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:01.336
no body fur and a glut of sweat glands

00:13:01.336 --> 00:13:02.952
that keep us cool while running;

00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:06.352
narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.270
large surface area of joints for shock absorption.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.004
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,

00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:14.107
short toes that are better for pushing off

00:13:14.107 --> 00:13:15.781
than for grasping tree limbs,

00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:16.908
and when we run,

00:13:16.908 --> 00:13:18.433
we can turn our torso and our shoulders

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:20.477
like this while keeping our heads straight.

00:13:20.477 --> 00:13:21.960
Our primate cousins can't do that.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.270
They have to run like this.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.336
And we have big old butt muscles

00:13:26.336 --> 00:13:28.423
that keep us upright while running.

00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:30.141
Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?

00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:33.146
They have no buns because they don't run upright.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.533
And as athletes have realized

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:37.090
that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.137
they've taken on feats

00:13:38.137 --> 00:13:40.546
that would have been unthinkable before,

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:44.449
athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.449
Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:47.961
(Laughter)

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:50.570
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.292
It's so steep he can't even run here.

00:13:52.292 --> 00:13:53.945
He's pulling up on a rope.

00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:55.282
This is a vertical ascent

00:13:55.282 --> 00:13:57.391
of more than 8,000 feet,

00:13:57.391 --> 00:13:59.058
and Kílian went up and down

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:01.439
in under three hours.

00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:03.358
Amazing.

00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:04.547
And talented though he is,

00:14:04.547 --> 00:14:07.371
Kílian is not a physiological freak.

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:09.050
Now that he has done this,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.961
other athletes will follow,

00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:12.478
just as other athletes followed

00:14:12.478 --> 00:14:14.052
after Sir Roger Bannister

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:16.190
ran under four minutes in the mile.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.817
Changing technology, changing genes,

00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:20.215
and a changing mindset.

00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:21.999
Innovation in sports,

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:23.656
whether that's new track surfaces

00:14:23.656 --> 00:14:25.120
or new swimming techniques,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.990
the democratization of sport,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.331
the spread to new bodies

00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:30.916
and to new populations around the world,

00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:32.969
and imagination in sport,

00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:34.405
an understanding of what the human body

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:36.186
is truly capable of,

00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:38.078
have conspired to make athletes stronger,

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:40.601
faster, bolder,

00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:42.578
and better than ever.

00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:44.934
Thank you very much.

00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:48.460
(Applause)
