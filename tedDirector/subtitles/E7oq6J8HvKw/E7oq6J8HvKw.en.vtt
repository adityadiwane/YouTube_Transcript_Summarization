00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If your life were a book

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and you were the author,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how would you want your story to go?

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:27.002
That's the question
that changed my life forever.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.000
Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.992
all I wanted was to be free.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I would daydream about
traveling the world,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
living in a place where it snowed,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I would picture all of the stories

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that I would go on to tell.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
At the age of 19,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the day after I graduated high school,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I moved to a place where it snowed

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I became a massage therapist.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
With this job all I needed were my hands

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and my massage table by my side

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.240
and I could go anywhere.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.000
For the first time in my life,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.530
I felt free, independent

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.574
and completely in control of my life.

00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:22.010
That is, until my life took a detour.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.000
I went home from work early one day

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.820
with what I thought was the flu,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.988
and less than 24 hours later

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I was in the hospital

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on life support

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.010
with less than a two percent chance of living.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.520
It wasn't until days later

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.000
as I lay in a coma

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that the doctors diagnosed me

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
with bacterial meningitis,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.560
a vaccine-preventable blood infection.

00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:53.978
Over the course of two and a half months

00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:57.670
I lost my spleen, my kidneys,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.000
the hearing in my left ear

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and both of my legs below the knee.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.824
When my parents
wheeled me out of the hospital

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:10.682
I felt like I had been
pieced back together

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:14.008
like a patchwork doll.

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.000
I thought the worst was over

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.000
until weeks later when I saw my new legs

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
for the first time.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.790
The calves were bulky blocks of metal

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:29.530
with pipes bolted together for the ankles

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.011
and a yellow rubber foot

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.971
with a raised rubber line
from the toe to the ankle

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.000
to look like a vein.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I didn't know what to expect,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but I wasn't expecting that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
With my mom by my side

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.716
and tears streaming down our faces,

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:56.000
I strapped on these chunky legs

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.997
and I stood up.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.280
They were so painful and so confining

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.010
that all I could think was,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.710
how am I ever going to travel the world

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.000
in these things?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
How was I ever going to live

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.728
the life full of adventure and stories,

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:17.000
as I always wanted?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.844
And how was I going to snowboard again?

00:03:21.844 --> 00:03:25.000
That day, I went home, I crawled into bed

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and this is what my life looked like

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.440
for the next few months:

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.640
me passed out, escaping from reality,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.013
with my legs resting by my side.

00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:46.290
I was absolutely physically
and emotionally broken.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.000
But I knew that in order to move forward,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.230
I had to let go of the old Amy

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.020
and learn to embrace the new Amy.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.350
And that is when it dawned on me

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.080
that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.000
I could be as tall as I wanted!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.680
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.011
Or as short as I wanted,
depending on who I was dating.

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:22.000
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.570
And if I snowboarded again,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.430
my feet aren't going to get cold.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.214
(Laughter)

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.450
And best of all, I thought,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.176
I can make my feet the size
of all the shoes

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.675
that are on the sales rack.
(Laughter)

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.590
And I did!

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.000
So there were benefits here.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.665
It was this moment that I asked myself

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:46.590
that life-defining question:

00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:48.932
If my life were a book

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:52.150
and I were the author,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.960
how would I want the story to go?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.450
And I began to daydream.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.240
I daydreamed like I did as a little girl

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.000
and I imagined myself

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
walking gracefully,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.441
helping other people through my journey

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.000
and snowboarding again.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And I didn't just see myself

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
carving down a mountain of powder,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I could actually feel it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I could feel the wind against my face

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and the beat of my racing heart

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.010
as if it were happening
in that very moment.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.400
And that is when a new chapter
in my life began.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.830
Four months later
I was back up on a snowboard,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.420
although things didn't go
quite as expected:

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.000
My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.710
and at one point I traumatized
all the skiers on the chair lift

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.070
when I fell and my legs,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.000
still attached to my snowboard —

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter) —

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
went flying down the mountain,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and I was on top of the mountain still.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I was so shocked,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.308
I was just as shocked as everybody else,
and I was so discouraged,

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:15.000
but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that I would be able to do this again.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this is when I learned
that our borders

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.028
and our obstacles
can only do two things:

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:27.000
one, stop us in our tracks

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.190
or two, force us to get creative.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.600
I did a year of research,
still couldn't figure out

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.000
what kind of legs to use,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.287
couldn't find any resources
that could help me.

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:40.580
So I decided to make a pair myself.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.637
My leg maker and I
put random parts together

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:46.902
and we made a pair of feet
that I could snowboard in.

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:49.000
As you can see,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
rusted bolts, rubber,
wood and neon pink duct tape.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And yes, I can change my toenail polish.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
It was these legs

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.965
and the best 21st birthday gift
I could ever receive —

00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:07.452
a new kidney from my dad —

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:10.000
that allowed me to follow my dreams again.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I started snowboarding,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.916
then I went back to work,
then I went back to school.

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:18.605
Then in 2005 I cofounded
a nonprofit organization

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.852
for youth and young adults
with physical disabilities

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:24.480
so they could get involved
with action sports.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.060
From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.255
where I helped to put shoes
on thousands of children's feet

00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:33.461
so they could attend school.

00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:35.670
And just this past February,

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.360
I won two back-to-back
World Cup gold medals —

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.392
(Applause) —

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:50.750
which made me

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.113
the highest ranked
adaptive female snowboarder

00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:55.740
in the world.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:59.000
Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.440
I had no idea what to expect.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.000
But if you ask me today,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
if I would ever want to
change my situation,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I would have to say no.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Because my legs haven't disabled me,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.540
if anything they've enabled me.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.000
They've forced me to rely on my imagination

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and to believe in the possibilities,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.780
and that's why I believe

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.000
that our imaginations can be used as tools

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
for breaking through borders,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
because in our minds,
we can do anything

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and we can be anything.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's believing in those dreams

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and facing our fears head-on

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.570
that allows us to live our lives

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.490
beyond our limits.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.860
And although today is about
innovation without borders,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.000
I have to say that in my life,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.428
innovation has only been possible

00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:54.600
because of my borders.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.005
I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.000
but also where the imagination

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.930
and the story begins.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.916
So the thought that I would like 
to challenge you with today

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:11.994
is that maybe instead of looking at 
our challenges and our limitations

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
as something negative or bad,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
we can begin to look at them as blessings,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.525
magnificent gifts that can be used
to ignite our imaginations

00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:29.015
and help us go further
than we ever knew we could go.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:33.000
It's not about breaking down borders.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.330
It's about pushing off of them

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.000
and seeing what amazing places

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
they might bring us.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.540
Thank you.
