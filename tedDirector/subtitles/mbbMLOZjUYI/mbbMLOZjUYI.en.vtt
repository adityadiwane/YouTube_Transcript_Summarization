00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.243
One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:23.537
so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.

00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:25.096
You. Yeah. (Laughter)

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.444
With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:29.499
You know who you are.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.896
Actually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:37.070
That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.183
I am one of the one in four. Thank you.

00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:45.193
I think I inherit it from my mother, who,

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:48.007
used to crawl around the house on all fours.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.054
She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:55.636
tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:57.944
And she would crawl around behind me going,

00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:01.509
"Who brings footprints into a building?!"

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.859
So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.051
So before I start, I would like to thank

00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:13.737
the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:18.660
because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.497
So how did it start?

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:27.616
My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:29.929
What am I going to talk about? Okay.

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.331
I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:36.870
it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.283
existentialist revelation,

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:43.628
or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)

00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:46.735
But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown

00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:48.725
during my daughter's sports day.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:52.450
There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.457
eating food out of the back of their car -- only the English --

00:01:56.457 --> 00:02:02.684
eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)

00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:07.316
Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:09.779
and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.990
and all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.858
"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"

00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:21.325
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:24.270
everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.037
at the starting line, just waving,

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:29.368
because she didn't know she was supposed to run.

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:33.717
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up

00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:38.310
I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.702
I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:46.190
Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.188
because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:52.558
sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg

00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:54.722
or I was with child I would have been inundated,

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:58.398
but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.

00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:00.098
Perk up.

00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:04.805
Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter)

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:08.105
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:12.382
Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:16.348
this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,

00:03:16.348 --> 00:03:18.660
because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.071
show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.165
so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.981
"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.429
So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.288
you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices,

00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:37.297
like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:39.925
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:41.804
there are no voices in your head.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.478
You know that when you have those abusive voices,

00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:46.379
all those little neurons get together and in that little gap

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.037
you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,

00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:52.783
and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:54.679
you might have yourself depression.

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.362
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.964
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,

00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:04.421
its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive

00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.413
that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,

00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:11.868
so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:15.345
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:18.859
such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.633
so he just feels the horror over and over again.

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:24.006
So here's my question. My question is, how come

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:28.051
when people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?

00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:31.270
How come every other organ in your body can get sick

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.974
and you get sympathy, except the brain?

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.373
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:38.404
because I know you like that here at TED,

00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:41.857
so if you just give me a minute here, okay.

00:04:41.857 --> 00:04:43.863
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.

00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:47.145
There is some good news. First of all, let me say,

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:49.472
we've come a long, long way.

00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:53.513
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:58.110
tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.010
Here we go. (Laughter)

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.375
This little baby has a lot of horsepower.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.798
It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.

00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:10.391
We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.

00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.037
We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:14.656
Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory,

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:19.893
so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:23.213
So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:26.516
just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:29.236
zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:32.828
I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)

00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:36.828
So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —

00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:40.517
And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.

00:05:40.517 --> 00:05:44.189
For every one single neuron, you can actually have

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.915
from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:51.177
or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:53.697
you learn something, or you have an experience,

00:05:53.697 --> 00:05:55.970
that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.924
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:03.847
that equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)

00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:05.541
Go figure.

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:09.025
But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:12.145
This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:16.325
We are not equipped for the 21st century.

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:20.074
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:22.657
and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,

00:06:22.657 --> 00:06:26.217
they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:28.741
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:31.185
in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.

00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:34.746
When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:38.507
millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened

00:06:38.507 --> 00:06:42.209
by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:45.157
we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:48.980
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.054
Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:55.672
and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:58.942
we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,

00:06:58.942 --> 00:07:00.875
and we'd go back to normal. Okay.

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:06.157
So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:09.924
when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical

00:07:09.924 --> 00:07:14.559
but because we can't kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:19.356
or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.844
over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,

00:07:21.844 --> 00:07:23.577
a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:26.682
About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,

00:07:26.682 --> 00:07:29.107
we started to put words to this constant emergency,

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:31.763
so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"

00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:35.804
which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.

00:07:35.804 --> 00:07:39.809
Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:42.295
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.831
over and over again that drives you insane, so,

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.808
you see what the problem is? What once made you safe

00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:49.614
now drives you insane.

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:52.768
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.

00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:58.632
Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)

00:07:58.632 --> 00:08:01.528
(Applause)

00:08:01.528 --> 00:08:06.683
So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)

00:08:06.683 --> 00:08:08.958
Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.

00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.417
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:13.755
and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:16.229
to be one in four. It's going to be four in four

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.492
who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:22.019
And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:28.696
Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:39.441
(Applause) Thank you.
