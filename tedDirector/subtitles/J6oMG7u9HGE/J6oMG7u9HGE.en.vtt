00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.879
So here's the good news about families.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.128
The last 50 years have seen a revolution

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:23.184
in what it means to be a family.

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:25.479
We have blended families, adopted families,

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.784
we have nuclear families living in separate houses

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:30.663
and divorced families living in the same house.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.722
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.271
Eight in 10 say the family they have today

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.808
is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:42.792
Now, here's the bad news.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.190
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.501
by the chaos of family life.

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.559
Every parent I know, myself included,

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.155
feels like we're constantly playing defense.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:55.208
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.248
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,

00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:00.448
they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:03.138
And here's the worst news of all.

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:06.064
Our children sense we're out of control.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:09.129
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:11.408
asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted

00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:14.841
one wish about your parents, what would it be?"

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.159
The parents predicted the kids would say,

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.025
spending more time with them.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.870
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.216
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.317
So how can we change this dynamic?

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.535
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.401
draw our family closer,

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:39.257
and generally prepare our children to enter the world?

00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:42.453
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:45.478
traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,

00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:48.536
experts ranging from elite peace negotiators

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:52.583
to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.949
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.935
and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:02.800
I want to tell you about one family that I met,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.424
and why I think they offer clues.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.411
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.719
where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.957
to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.

00:02:13.957 --> 00:02:16.182
The Starrs are a regular American family

00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:18.933
with their share of regular American family problems.

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.725
David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.517
of their four children, ages 10 to 15.

00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:27.541
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.046
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:33.557
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:36.885
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:40.229
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.997
Instead of turning to friends or relatives,

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.709
they looked to David's workplace.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.487
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development

00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:51.557
that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:54.533
to startups in Silicon Valley.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.401
In agile, workers are organized into small groups

00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:00.087
and do things in very short spans of time.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:03.029
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.229
the team in effect manages itself.

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.860
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.477
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:15.677
David said when they brought this system into their home,

00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:19.093
the family meetings in particular increased communication,

00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:21.469
decreased stress, and made everybody

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.573
happier to be part of the family team.

00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:27.556
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.069
into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.133
it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.322
And these meetings had this effect

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:39.821
while taking under 20 minutes.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.973
So what is Agile, and why can it help

00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:44.701
with something that seems so different, like families?

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.050
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.367
at a financial firm in New England.

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:52.385
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:55.137
Companies followed the waterfall method, right,

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:58.195
in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down

00:03:58.195 --> 00:03:59.814
to programmers below,

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:02.462
and no one had ever consulted the programmers.

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.041
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.438
They were too bloated or too out of date

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.120
by the time they were done.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.564
Sutherland wanted to create a system where

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:16.742
ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom

00:04:16.742 --> 00:04:19.287
and be adjusted in real time.

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:22.350
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.142
before stumbling upon an article in 1986

00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:28.221
called "The New New Product Development Game."

00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:30.472
It said that the pace of business was quickening --

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:32.601
and by the way, this was in 1986 --

00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:36.566
and the most successful companies were flexible.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:38.350
It highlighted Toyota and Canon

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.654
and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.

00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:45.019
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:47.184
and said, "That's it."

00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:49.901
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use

00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:52.902
large, massive projects that take two years.

00:04:52.902 --> 00:04:54.130
They do things in small chunks.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.579
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.645
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:01.646
and come back with a cell phone or a social network,"

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:04.078
you say, "You go off and come up with one element,

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:06.598
then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:10.206
You succeed or fail quickly.

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:13.374
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,

00:05:13.374 --> 00:05:16.312
and it's sweeping into management suites.

00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:18.822
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:21.097
and applying it to their families.

00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:23.670
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.566
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:27.076
an Agile Thanksgiving,

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:29.587
where you had one group of people working on the food,

00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:32.918
one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:36.438
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:39.118
So let's take one problem that families face,

00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:42.135
crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.

00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:44.301
A key plank is accountability,

00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:46.100
so teams use information radiators,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.863
these large boards in which everybody is accountable.

00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:51.799
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:53.460
created a morning checklist

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.048
in which each child is expected to tick off chores.

00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:59.428
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,

00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:02.138
poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.646
and she sat there,

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.644
kind of amiably talking to each of her children

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.635
as one after the other they came downstairs,

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:11.004
checked the list, made themselves breakfast,

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.787
checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,

00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:16.907
rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:19.331
checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,

00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:21.968
and made their way to the bus.

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:26.045
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:29.187
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.370
our kids needed way too much monitoring,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.670
Eleanor looked at me.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.838
"That's what I thought," she said.

00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:36.158
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:37.779
But I was wrong."

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.883
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"

00:06:39.883 --> 00:06:42.819
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.353
And he made a checkmark.

00:06:44.353 --> 00:06:46.489
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.965
With kids, it's heaven."

00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:51.802
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,

00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:55.949
it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.034
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.

00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:02.355
So following the agile model, we ask three questions:

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.277
What worked well in our family this week,

00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:08.437
what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?

00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:10.024
Everyone throws out suggestions

00:07:10.024 --> 00:07:12.756
and then we pick two to focus on.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:16.658
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.

00:07:16.658 --> 00:07:18.778
What worked well this week?

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.698
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:24.610
What didn't work well? Our math sheets,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.797
or greeting visitors at the door.

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:31.225
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:33.770
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.304
I mean at least not that are revealing.

00:07:35.304 --> 00:07:39.067
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.

00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:40.854
But the most surprising part was when we turned to,

00:07:40.854 --> 00:07:43.508
what are we going to work on in the week ahead?

00:07:43.508 --> 00:07:45.525
You know, the key idea of agile is that

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:47.330
teams essentially manage themselves,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.674
and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.

00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:52.365
Our kids love this process.

00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.554
So they would come up with all these ideas.

00:07:54.554 --> 00:07:56.600
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.163
get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.

00:07:59.163 --> 00:08:01.975
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.

00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:04.142
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.

00:08:04.142 --> 00:08:07.087
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.079
Now look, naturally there's a gap between

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:12.447
their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.561
but the truth is it didn't really bother us.

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:16.911
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables

00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:20.241
that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.

00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:22.671
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.108
We're still holding these meetings.

00:08:25.108 --> 00:08:29.840
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.223
So what did we learn?

00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:34.724
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.924
when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers

00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:41.056
met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:44.587
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:47.962
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.

00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:50.721
I'm proposing three planks.

00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:54.289
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.

00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:56.075
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:59.174
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.

00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:02.823
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.

00:09:02.823 --> 00:09:06.257
We can't. What's great about the agile system

00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:08.123
is you build in a system of change

00:09:08.123 --> 00:09:11.154
so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.

00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:12.598
It's like they say in the Internet world:

00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:15.342
if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,

00:09:15.342 --> 00:09:17.000
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.908
Parents can learn a lot from that.

00:09:19.908 --> 00:09:23.220
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.596
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket

00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:27.933
that the only ideas we can try at home

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:31.300
are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.620
or other family experts.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.892
The truth is, their ideas are stale,

00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:38.188
whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas

00:09:38.188 --> 00:09:41.513
to make groups and teams work effectively.

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.648
Let's just take a few examples.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.868
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:47.925
Everybody knows that having family dinner

00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:50.253
with your children is good for the kids.

00:09:50.253 --> 00:09:53.212
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.

00:09:53.212 --> 00:09:55.484
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,

00:09:55.484 --> 00:09:57.863
"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.999
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:02.991
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.

00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:05.857
We'll make Sunday meals more important."

00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:09.407
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.

00:10:09.407 --> 00:10:12.319
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:14.156
in any family meal.

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:18.074
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."

00:10:18.074 --> 00:10:20.111
You can take that 10 minutes and move it

00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:23.391
to any part of the day and have the same benefit.

00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:26.216
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:28.506
An environmental psychologist told me,

00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:31.841
"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,

00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.291
you'll be more rigid.

00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:37.194
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."

00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:38.801
She told me, "When you're discipling your children,

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:41.199
sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:43.753
The conversation will go better."

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:47.370
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.190
because I was sitting above in the power position.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.230
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.584
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.

00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:58.971
We've got to hook them up with parents.

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:01.398
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.

00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:05.838
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.

00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:09.934
Plank number two: Empower your children.

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:12.948
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.

00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:15.542
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.605
There's a reason that few systems have been more

00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:20.657
waterfall over time than the family.

00:11:20.657 --> 00:11:22.474
But the single biggest lesson we learned

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.361
is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.

00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:29.226
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.

00:11:29.226 --> 00:11:31.114
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,

00:11:31.114 --> 00:11:33.993
and we had voted to work on overreacting.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.289
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:41.865
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.

00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:43.623
So we kind of liked that.

00:11:43.623 --> 00:11:45.262
But then her sister started working the system.

00:11:45.262 --> 00:11:48.399
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:51.869
or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:54.097
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.

00:11:54.097 --> 00:11:56.369
Now give us a punishment. Okay.

00:11:56.369 --> 00:12:01.273
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.

00:12:01.273 --> 00:12:04.697
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:08.081
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.809
There's plenty of parental authority going on.

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:13.524
But we're giving them practice becoming independent,

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.091
which of course is our ultimate goal.

00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:18.409
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,

00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:20.233
one of my daughters started screaming.

00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:22.748
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"

00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:25.677
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:29.186
To me that is a certified agile miracle.

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:31.393
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:36.129
And by the way, research backs this up too.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:39.705
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,

00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:43.630
evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.857
and take more control over their lives.

00:12:47.857 --> 00:12:51.009
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:54.113
and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.

00:12:54.113 --> 00:12:55.861
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,

00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:58.103
and he was chiding me for not letting my children

00:12:58.103 --> 00:13:00.772
make mistakes with their allowance.

00:13:00.772 --> 00:13:02.748
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.889
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.321
with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.993
or a $6 million inheritance."

00:13:10.993 --> 00:13:13.473
So the bottom line is, empower your children.

00:13:13.473 --> 00:13:18.259
Plank number three: Tell your story.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:22.222
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.

00:13:22.222 --> 00:13:24.162
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"

00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:26.865
told me that successful human organizations of any kind

00:13:26.865 --> 00:13:28.379
have two things in common:

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.674
they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.

00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:33.879
So agile is great for stimulating progress,

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.161
but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.

00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:39.215
So how do you do that?

00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:41.422
Collins coached us on doing something

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:44.209
that businesses do, which is define your mission

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.603
and identify your core values.

00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:50.161
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.

00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:52.425
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.

00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:54.729
We had a pajama party.

00:13:54.729 --> 00:13:58.289
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.

00:13:58.289 --> 00:13:59.161
My wife bought a flip chart.

00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:01.778
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?

00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:03.903
What values do we most uphold?

00:14:03.903 --> 00:14:05.659
And we ended up with 10 statements.

00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:07.630
We are travelers, not tourists.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.305
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:14.536
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time

00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:16.875
worrying about what they do wrong

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.032
and more time focusing on what they do right,

00:14:20.032 --> 00:14:24.143
worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.

00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:26.879
This family mission statement is a great way to identify

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:29.399
what it is that you do right.

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:31.689
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:33.677
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.

00:14:33.677 --> 00:14:36.033
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:37.287
And we didn't really know what to do,

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:38.715
so we called her into my office.

00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:40.372
The family mission statement was on the wall,

00:14:40.372 --> 00:14:43.483
and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:46.359
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:48.087
"Bring people together?"

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:51.543
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.

00:14:51.543 --> 00:14:52.875
Another great way to tell your story

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:56.170
is to tell your children where they came from.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.871
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple

00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:00.953
"what do you know" test.

00:15:00.953 --> 00:15:03.031
Do you know where your grandparents were born?

00:15:03.031 --> 00:15:05.495
Do you know where your parents went to high school?

00:15:05.495 --> 00:15:07.280
Do you know anybody in your family

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.279
who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:14.849
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale

00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:19.415
had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.

00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:22.671
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.375
of emotional health and happiness.

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:27.551
As the author of the study told me,

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:31.405
children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative

00:15:31.405 --> 00:15:34.359
have greater self-confidence.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.335
So my final plank is, tell your story.

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:41.326
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:44.167
and how you overcame the negative ones.

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:46.623
If you give children this happy narrative,

00:15:46.623 --> 00:15:52.334
you give them the tools to make themselves happier.

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:54.757
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"

00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:56.509
and its famous opening sentence,

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:58.468
"All happy families are alike.

00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:02.559
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:05.783
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.

00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:08.906
Of course all happy families aren't alike."

00:16:08.906 --> 00:16:11.247
But as I began working on this project,

00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:13.959
I began changing my mind.

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:16.511
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:19.247
to identify the building blocks

00:16:19.247 --> 00:16:22.223
that successful families have.

00:16:22.223 --> 00:16:24.367
I've mentioned just three here today:

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:29.534
Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.

00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:33.920
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.296
The answer, I believe, is yes.

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.008
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,

00:16:40.008 --> 00:16:41.750
his brother Nikolay came to him

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.724
and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness

00:16:44.724 --> 00:16:47.504
on a little green stick, which he had hidden

00:16:47.504 --> 00:16:50.620
in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.053
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.

00:16:55.053 --> 00:17:00.549
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:04.900
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.445
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.996
That story perfectly captures for me

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:14.204
the final lesson that I learned:

00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:16.868
Happiness is not something we find,

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:19.764
it's something we make.

00:17:19.764 --> 00:17:23.034
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations

00:17:23.034 --> 00:17:26.015
has come to pretty much the same conclusion.

00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.404
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.

00:17:28.404 --> 00:17:31.268
It's a matter of choice.

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:34.732
You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.

00:17:34.732 --> 00:17:36.916
You just need to take small steps,

00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:39.108
accumulate small wins,

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:41.932
keep reaching for that green stick.

00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:45.581
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.

00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:49.748
What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

00:17:49.748 --> 00:17:53.748
(Applause)
