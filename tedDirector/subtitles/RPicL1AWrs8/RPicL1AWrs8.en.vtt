00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to talk today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about the pleasures of everyday life.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
But I want to begin with a story

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of an unusual and terrible man.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
This is Hermann Goering.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
his designated successor.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And like Hitler,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Goering fancied himself a collector of art.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
He went through Europe, through World War II,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
stealing, extorting and occasionally buying

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
various paintings for his collection.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So he finally found an art dealer,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
who sold him a wonderful Vermeer

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And it was his favorite artwork ever.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
World War II came to an end,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and ultimately sentenced to death.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Then the Allied forces went through his collections

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and found the paintings

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and went after the people who sold it to him.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and arrested Van Meegeren.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
which is itself punishable by death.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Six weeks into his prison sentence,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
van Meegeren confessed.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
But he didn't confess to treason.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
to that Nazi.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Now nobody believed him.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And he said, "I'll prove it.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Bring me a canvas and some paint,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and I will paint a Vermeer much better

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
than I sold that disgusting Nazi.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
(Laughter)

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
So they brought him in.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And then the charges of treason were dropped.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
He had a lesser charge of forgery,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
got a year sentence

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and died a hero to the Dutch people.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
but I want to turn now to Goering,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
His American interrogators described him

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
as an amicable psychopath.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
But you could feel sympathy

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
for the reaction he had

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
when he was told that his favorite painting

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
was actually a forgery.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
According to his biographer,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
"He looked as if for the first time

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
he had discovered there was evil in the world."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
(Laughter)

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And he killed himself soon afterwards.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
He had discovered after all

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
that the painting he thought was this

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
was actually that.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It looked the same,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
that he himself had painted

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
that were attributed to other artists.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
people would come [from] all over the world to see it --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
was actually a forgery.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
It was not that painting, but that painting.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And when that was discovered,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Why does this matter?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Why do we respond so much

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
to our knowledge of where something comes from?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Well there's an answer that many people would give.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
is because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Among other things,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
it's always better to own an original than a forgery

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I don't doubt that that plays some role,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
but what I want to convince you of today

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is that there's something else going on.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I want to convince you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
What I mean by this

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
is we don't just respond to things as we see them,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
or feel them, or hear them.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
about what they really are, what they came from,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I want to suggest that this is true,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
not just for how we think about things,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
but how we react to things.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and that this isn't true

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
just for higher level pleasures like art,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
but even the most seemingly simple pleasures

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
So take food.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Would you eat this?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Some of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Some of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
or a human.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
That's not so surprising.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
But what's more interesting

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is how it tastes to you

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
will depend critically on what you think you're eating.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
So one demonstration of this was done with young children.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
How do you make children

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk --

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
to think they taste better?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
They believe McDonald's food is tastier,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and it leads them to experience it as tastier.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
It's very simple:

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
pour it from an expensive bottle.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
it tastes better to you.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
They get people into a fMRI scanner,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and while they're lying there, through a tube,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
they get to sip wine.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Everybody, of course,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
drinks exactly the same wine.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
light up like a Christmas tree.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
you really experience it in a different way.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Or take sex.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And if you simply show people these pictures,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
they'll say these are fairly attractive people.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
But how attractive you find them,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
how sexually or romantically moved you are by them,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
rests critically on who you think you're looking at.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
You probably think the picture on the left is male,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
the one on the right is female.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
(Laughter)

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It will make a difference if they turn out to be

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
much younger or much older than you think they are.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It will make a difference if you were to discover

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
that the person you're looking at with lust

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
your mother or father.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Maybe one of the most heartening findings

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
from the psychology of pleasure

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
If you like somebody, they look better to you.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
This is why spouses in happy marriages

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
tend to think that their husband or wife

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
A particularly dramatic example of this

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
where you get a specific delusion.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Sufferers of Capgras syndrome

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
believe that the people they love most in the world

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
have been replaced by perfect duplicates.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
People have murdered those that they loved,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
believing that they were murdering an imposter.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But there's at least one case

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
This was recorded in 1931.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
After she got it, "She was happy to report

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
that she has discovered that he possessed a double

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Of course, it was the same man,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
but she was seeing him in different ways.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
As a third example,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
consider consumer products.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So one reason why you might like something is its utility.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
But each of these three objects has value

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
above and beyond what it can do for you

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
based on its history.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and sold for several hundreds of dollars.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And in fact, there's a thriving market

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in the partially eaten food of beloved people.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
(Laughter)

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
According to an unconfirmed report,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
for this pair of shoes.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
They were the ones thrown at George Bush

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
at an Iraqi press conference several years ago.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
(Applause)

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Now this attraction to objects

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
doesn't just work for celebrity objects.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Each one of us, most people,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
in that it has value because of its history --

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
maybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes --

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
so that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
but you couldn't get the same object back.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
for the objects that people like.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
So in one of our experiments,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
we asked people to name a famous person who they adored,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
a living person they adored.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So one answer was George Clooney.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Then we asked them,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And the answer is a fair amount --

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
more than you would pay for a brand new sweater

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Then we asked other groups of subjects --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
we gave them different restrictions

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and different conditions.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So for instance, we told some people,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
"Look, you can buy the sweater,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
but you can't tell anybody you own it,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and you can't resell it."

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
That drops the value of it,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
But what really causes an effect

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
but before it gets to you,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
it's thoroughly washed."

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
That causes a huge drop in the value.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
(Laughter)

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
So let's go back to art.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
you could buy me a Chagall.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
But I don't want a duplicate,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
even if I can't tell the difference.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
That's not because, or it's not simply because,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
In the case of artwork,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
the history is special indeed.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
The philosopher Denis Dutton

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
makes the case that, "The value of an artwork

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
And that could explain the difference

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
between an original and a forgery.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
They may look alike, but they have a different history.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
The original is typically the product of a creative act,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
the forgery isn't.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
I think this approach can explain differences

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
in people's taste in art.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
They just don't like it.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
I'm not going to make a claim about who's right,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
but I will make an empirical claim

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
about people's intuitions,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
to believe that these works are difficult to create,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
that they require a lot of time and energy

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and creative energy.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
because there's a young American artist

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
and her work was worth

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
many tens of thousands of dollars --

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
in large part because she's a very young artist.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
This is Marla Olmstead

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
who did most of her work when she was three years old.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
is her family made the mistake

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to film her painting.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And they then reported that her father was coaching her.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
When this came out on television,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
the value of her art dropped to nothing.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
It was the same art, physically,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
but the history had changed.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
I've been focusing now on the visual arts,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
but I want to give two examples from music.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
the music of Joshua Bell,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
down to a Washington D.C. subway station

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And here's a brief clip of this.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:11.260
(Violin music)

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
After being there for three-quarters of an hour,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
he made 32 dollars.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Not bad. It's also not good.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
He actually made 20 dollars more than that,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
but he didn't count it.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Because this woman comes up --

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
you see at the end of the video -- she comes up.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
at this extravagant black-tie affair.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So she's struck with pity.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
(Laughter)

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
(Applause)

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
The second example from music

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
is from John Cage's modernist composition,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
"4'33"."

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
As many of you know,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
opens up the piano

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds --

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
that period of silence.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And people have different views on this.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
But what I want to point out

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
is you can buy this from iTunes.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
(Laughter)

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
For a dollar 99,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
you can listen to that silence,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
which is different than other forms of silence.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
(Laughter)

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Now I've been talking so far about pleasure,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
but what I want to suggest

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
is that everything I've said applies as well to pain.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And how you think about what you're experiencing,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
your beliefs about the essence of it,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
affect how it hurts.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
One lovely experiment

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
to an electric shock machine.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So it was a series of five painful shocks.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
by somebody in another room,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
The first shock is recorded as very painful.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
The pain gets less.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
In the other condition,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
they're told that the person in the next room

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
The first shock hurts like hell.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
The second shock hurts just as much,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
and the third and the fourth and the fifth.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
It hurts more

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
The most extreme example of this

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
is that in some cases,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
pain under the right circumstances

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
can transform into pleasure.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
that will often seek out low-level doses of pain

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
in controlled circumstances

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and take pleasure from it --

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
as in the eating of hot chili peppers

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and roller coaster rides.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
The point was nicely summarized

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
by the poet John Milton

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
who wrote, "The mind is its own place,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and in itself can make a heaven of hell,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
a hell of heaven."

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
And I'll end with that. Thank you.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:10.260
(Applause)
