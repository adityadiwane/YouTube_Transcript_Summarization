00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.977
The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.995
started for me when I was 15 years old.

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.516
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:26.899
And I started to feed them in the most traditional

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.870
and environmentally friendly way.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.195
I went to my school kitchen, and I said,

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:32.741
"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:33.607
their noses up at."

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:36.271
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.003
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:40.841
who was throwing away potatoes because they were

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.027
the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:47.116
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.773
into delicious pork. I sold that pork

00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:51.760
to my school friends' parents, and I made

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.397
a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.

00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:59.279
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:01.662
was in fact fit for human consumption,

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.931
and that I was only scratching the surface,

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.793
and that right the way up the food supply chain,

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:10.011
in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.271
in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:15.868
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:17.242
about how much food they were wasting.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.726
I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.477
being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:25.498
and I thought, surely there is something more sensible

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:28.665
to do with food than waste it.

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.970
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.657
I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:36.732
that used to crop up from time to time.

00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:38.134
I grabbed hold of it,

00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:41.680
sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.800
That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.055
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:51.405
and the provision of the solution to food waste,

00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:54.059
which is simply to sit down and eat food,

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:55.547
rather than throwing it away.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:58.826
That became, as it were, a way of confronting

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:01.813
large businesses in the business of wasting food,

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:04.334
and exposing, most importantly, to the public,

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.504
that when we're talking about food being thrown away,

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:08.643
we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.355
stuff that's beyond the pale.

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.471
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted

00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.009
on a colossal scale.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.866
Eventually, I set about writing my book,

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.920
really to demonstrate the extent of this problem

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.316
on a global scale. What this shows is

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.795
a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.897
of food waste in each country in the world.

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:33.785
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.267
and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.420
some proxy way of uncovering

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.665
how much food was being wasted.

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:43.221
So I took the food supply of every single country

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:46.263
and I compared it to what was actually likely

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:48.295
to be being consumed in each country.

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:52.182
That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:54.848
levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:56.190
that gives you an approximate guess

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.417
as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:02.146
That black line in the middle of that table

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.142
is the likely level of consumption

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:09.504
with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.

00:03:09.504 --> 00:03:11.423
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.403
that I think we can live in a waste-free world.

00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:17.276
But that black line shows what a food supply should be

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:21.730
in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.479
nutritional diet for every person in that country.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.886
Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:30.587
that includes most countries in the world,

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:34.876
represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect

00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:37.498
levels of waste in each country.

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:40.767
As a country gets richer, it invests more and more

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:42.058
in getting more and more surplus

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:44.868
into its shops and restaurants,

00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:46.924
and as you can see, most European

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:48.336
and North American countries

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:51.476
fall between 150 and 200 percent

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.856
of the nutritional requirements of their populations.

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:57.264
So a country like America has twice as much food

00:03:57.264 --> 00:03:59.868
on its shop shelves and in its restaurants

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:03.436
than is actually required to feed the American people.

00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:04.996
But the thing that really struck me,

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:09.211
when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,

00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:12.877
was that you can see how it levels off.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.945
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:19.233
and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:20.779
as you might expect.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.324
So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:25.609
to see if that was true or false.

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:27.103
And that's what I came up with.

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:29.030
If you include not just the food that ends up

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.154
in shops and restaurants, but also the food

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:33.310
that people feed to livestock,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.813
the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat

00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:39.294
but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:41.225
increasing amounts of meat and dairy products,

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:42.892
what you find is that most rich countries

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:47.215
have between three and four times the amount of food

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:50.299
that their population needs to feed itself.

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:53.582
A country like America has four times the amount of food

00:04:53.582 --> 00:04:56.544
that it needs.

00:04:56.544 --> 00:04:59.506
When people talk about the need to increase global

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:02.166
food production to feed those nine billion people

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.678
that are expected on the planet by 2050,

00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:06.399
I always think of these graphs.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.350
The fact is, we have an enormous buffer

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.231
in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.

00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:17.907
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.

00:05:17.907 --> 00:05:20.573
In many ways, this is a great success story

00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:24.712
of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses

00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:28.065
that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.

00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:31.622
It is a success story. It has been a success story.

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.159
But what we have to recognize now is that we are

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.791
reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,

00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:40.428
and when we chop down forests, as we are every day,

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:41.776
to grow more and more food,

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:45.524
when we extract water from depleting water reserves,

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:48.912
when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest

00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:50.204
to grow more and more food,

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:53.055
and then we throw away so much of it,

00:05:53.055 --> 00:05:55.991
we have to think about what we can start saving.

00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:59.716
And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.932
that I often visit to

00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:06.113
inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.

00:06:06.113 --> 00:06:08.516
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:10.143
all the fruit and vegetables and everything else

00:06:10.143 --> 00:06:11.090
that was in there.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.530
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.965
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:19.493
that I found in the bin represent the global food supply,

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:21.094
okay? We start out with nine.

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:24.577
That's what's in fields around the world every single year.

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:26.338
The first biscuit we're going to lose

00:06:26.338 --> 00:06:28.097
before we even leave the farm.

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:31.362
That's a problem primarily associated with

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:33.026
developing work agriculture, whether it's

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.531
a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,

00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:38.444
grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:42.193
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:45.689
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.429
to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:54.273
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,

00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:58.448
and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,

00:06:58.448 --> 00:07:01.066
so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:03.300
in meat and dairy products.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.884
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.437
This is what most of us think of when we think

00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:10.948
of food waste, what ends up in the garbage,

00:07:10.948 --> 00:07:12.796
what ends up in supermarket bins,

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:15.526
what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:19.284
and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.

00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:23.083
That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.543
especially when you think of the billion hungry people

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:27.683
that exist already in the world.

00:07:27.683 --> 00:07:29.666
Having gone through the data, I then needed

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:33.344
to demonstrate where that food ends up.

00:07:33.344 --> 00:07:34.963
Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:36.866
on our plates, but what about all the stuff

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:38.806
that goes missing in between?

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:41.218
Supermarkets are an easy place to start.

00:07:41.218 --> 00:07:43.809
This is the result of my hobby,

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:48.285
which is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:50.882
Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations

00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:53.990
to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.474
we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,

00:07:56.474 --> 00:07:59.030
opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.990
But this is what you can see more or less on

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.502
every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:07.568
It represents a colossal waste of food,

00:08:07.568 --> 00:08:10.070
but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.414
was that this very evident abundance of waste

00:08:13.414 --> 00:08:16.358
was actually the tip of the iceberg.

00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:18.414
When you start going up the supply chain,

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:21.400
you find where the real food waste is happening

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.387
on a gargantuan scale.

00:08:23.387 --> 00:08:24.860
Can I have a show of hands

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.318
if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:31.237
Who lives in a household where that crust --

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:34.430
that slice at the first and last end of each loaf --

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.874
who lives in a household where it does get eaten?

00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:39.241
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people,

00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:41.697
and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,

00:08:41.697 --> 00:08:44.486
and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:46.722
anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches

00:08:46.722 --> 00:08:48.496
with crusts on it? (Laughter)

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:50.079
I certainly haven't.

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:55.247
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)

00:08:55.247 --> 00:08:57.462
This is the answer, unfortunately:

00:08:57.462 --> 00:08:59.374
13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of

00:08:59.374 --> 00:09:04.975
this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.

00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:06.484
In the same year that I visited this factory,

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:10.934
I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry

00:09:10.934 --> 00:09:14.711
as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.

00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:16.895
We contribute to that squeeze

00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:19.887
by depositing food in bins here in Britain

00:09:19.887 --> 00:09:22.094
and elsewhere in the world. We take food

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:25.200
off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.750
Go one step up, and you get to farmers,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.910
who throw away sometimes a third or even more

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.955
of their harvest because of cosmetic standards.

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:34.878
This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds

00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:38.302
in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,

00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:40.756
because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.

00:09:40.756 --> 00:09:43.236
Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:44.769
all going for pigs.

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:48.807
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,

00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:50.823
tomatoes in Tenerife,

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.628
oranges in Florida,

00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:55.632
bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,

00:09:55.632 --> 00:09:58.047
all being discarded. This is one day's waste

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:00.584
from one banana plantation in Ecuador.

00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:02.792
All being discarded, perfectly edible,

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:05.280
because they're the wrong shape or size.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.860
If we do that to fruit and vegetables,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.675
you bet we can do it to animals too.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:12.414
Liver, lungs, heads, tails,

00:10:12.414 --> 00:10:14.392
kidneys, testicles,

00:10:14.392 --> 00:10:16.105
all of these things which are traditional,

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:18.920
delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.416
go to waste. Offal consumption has halved

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.951
in Britain and America in the last 30 years.

00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:27.591
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:29.360
or is incinerated.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.207
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,

00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:35.122
is serving up his national dish.

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:36.837
It's called sheep's organs.

00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:38.504
It's delicious, it's nutritious,

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.912
and as I learned when I went to Kashgar,

00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:43.981
it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.

00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.177
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.

00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:48.781
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.546
and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking

00:10:50.546 --> 00:10:53.112
and he started frowning into my bowl.

00:10:53.112 --> 00:10:54.991
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?

00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:56.585
How have I insulted my host?"

00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:58.323
He pointed at three grains of rice

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:02.607
at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)

00:11:02.607 --> 00:11:04.519
I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.935
telling people to stop wasting food.

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:10.984
This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)

00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:14.207
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:19.243
do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources

00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:21.443
if we regard it as socially unacceptable

00:11:21.443 --> 00:11:22.947
to waste food on a colossal scale,

00:11:22.947 --> 00:11:25.500
if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,

00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:28.135
tell governments we want to see an end to food waste,

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:30.631
we do have the power to bring about that change.

00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:33.343
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish

00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:36.424
are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.

00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:39.116
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:42.033
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:44.671
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:48.247
Most people. The one on the left

00:11:48.247 --> 00:11:49.700
was kept in a fridge for 10 days.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.919
The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.494
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.

00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:56.676
It's a living organism, cut the slice off,

00:11:56.676 --> 00:11:58.119
stuck it in a vase of water,

00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:01.667
it was all right for another two weeks after this.

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:03.626
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning,

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:05.458
will inevitably arise, so the question is,

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.656
what is the best thing to do with it?

00:12:07.656 --> 00:12:09.162
I answered that question when I was 15.

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:14.572
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:16.784
We domesticated pigs

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:19.556
to turn food waste back into food.

00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:23.287
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal

00:12:23.287 --> 00:12:26.574
since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.

00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:28.475
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:31.158
If you cook food for pigs, just as if

00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:34.127
you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.

00:12:34.127 --> 00:12:36.687
It's also a massive saving of resources.

00:12:36.687 --> 00:12:39.582
At the moment, Europe depends on importing

00:12:39.582 --> 00:12:41.248
millions of tons of soy from South America,

00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:44.134
where its production contributes to global warming,

00:12:44.134 --> 00:12:46.734
to deforestation, to biodiversity loss,

00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:49.181
to feed livestock here in Europe.

00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:51.483
At the same time we throw away millions of tons

00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:54.702
of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:57.564
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save

00:12:57.564 --> 00:12:59.915
that amount of carbon.

00:12:59.915 --> 00:13:03.007
If we feed our food waste which is the current

00:13:03.007 --> 00:13:05.302
government favorite way of getting rid of food waste,

00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:08.103
to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:10.407
into gas to produce electricity,

00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:14.140
you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.622
per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.

00:13:16.622 --> 00:13:19.882
We knew that during the war. (Laughter)

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:24.156
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally,

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:25.926
the quest to tackle food waste.

00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:29.780
Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.036
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise

00:13:32.036 --> 00:13:33.434
would have been wasted.

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:35.734
Since then, it's happened again in London,

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.867
it's happening internationally, and across the country.

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:40.210
It's a way of organizations coming together

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.952
to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food

00:13:43.952 --> 00:13:46.759
is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.352
For the sake of the planet we live on,

00:13:49.352 --> 00:13:52.632
for the sake of our children,

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:54.202
for the sake of all the other

00:13:54.202 --> 00:13:56.650
organisms that share our planet with us,

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.691
we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:02.313
for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:04.827
to grow food that no one eats.

00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:07.923
Stop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:10.482
(Applause)
