00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.802
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:21.506
I moved to America 12 years ago
with my wife Terry and our two kids.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.316
Actually, truthfully, we moved
to Los Angeles --

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.764
(Laughter)

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:30.122
thinking we were moving
to America, but anyway --

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:32.081
(Laughter)

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:37.085
It's a short plane ride
from Los Angeles to America.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.751
(Laughter)

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.035
I got here 12 years ago,

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.845
and when I got here,
I was told various things,

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.916
like, "Americans don't get irony."

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:50.768
(Laughter)

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.014
Have you come across this idea?

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:54.197
It's not true.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.983
I've traveled the whole length
and breadth of this country.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.633
I have found no evidence
that Americans don't get irony.

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:02.234
It's one of those cultural myths,

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:04.146
like, "The British are reserved."

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.369
(Laughter)

00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:08.099
I don't know why people think this.

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.942
We've invaded every country
we've encountered.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.250
(Laughter)

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:17.102
But it's not true Americans
don't get irony,

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.598
but I just want you to know
that that's what people

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.432
are saying about you behind your back.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.392
You know, so when you leave
living rooms in Europe,

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.623
people say, thankfully,
nobody was ironic in your presence.

00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:29.034
(Laughter)

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:31.595
But I knew that Americans get irony

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.344
when I came across that legislation,
"No Child Left Behind."

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:37.150
(Laughter)

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:40.775
Because whoever thought
of that title gets irony.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.537
(Laughter)

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.019
Don't they?

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:49.842
(Applause)

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.838
Because it's leaving
millions of children behind.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.725
Now I can see that's not a very attractive
name for legislation:

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.471
"Millions of Children Left Behind."

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.240
I can see that.

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:01.461
What's the plan?

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:04.249
We propose to leave
millions of children behind,

00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:06.011
and here's how it's going to work.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:07.421
And it's working beautifully.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.452
(Laughter)

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.857
In some parts of the country,

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.838
60 percent of kids drop out
of high school.

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.344
In the Native American communities,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.753
it's 80 percent of kids.

00:02:17.777 --> 00:02:20.344
If we halved that number,

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:26.026
one estimate is it would create
a net gain to the U.S. economy

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.087
over 10 years,
of nearly a trillion dollars.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.833
From an economic point of view,

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:35.765
this is good math, isn't it,
that we should do this?

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.114
It actually costs an enormous amount

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:41.821
to mop up the damage
from the dropout crisis.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.005
But the dropout crisis
is just the tip of an iceberg.

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.696
What it doesn't count
are all the kids who are in school

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.258
but being disengaged
from it, who don't enjoy it,

00:02:52.282 --> 00:02:54.826
who don't get any real benefit from it.

00:02:55.622 --> 00:02:58.590
And the reason is not
that we're not spending enough money.

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:02.079
America spends more money on education
than most other countries.

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:05.345
Class sizes are smaller
than in many countries.

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:07.943
And there are hundreds
of initiatives every year

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:09.603
to try and improve education.

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:13.595
The trouble is, it's all going
in the wrong direction.

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:19.340
There are three principles
on which human life flourishes,

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:23.351
and they are contradicted
by the culture of education

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.628
under which most teachers have to labor

00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:28.204
and most students have to endure.

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:35.479
The first is this, that human beings
are naturally different and diverse.

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.502
Can I ask you, how many of you
have got children of your own?

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:42.835
Okay. Or grandchildren.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.807
How about two children or more? Right.

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:49.741
And the rest of you
have seen such children.

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:52.501
(Laughter)

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.015
Small people wandering about.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.761
(Laughter)

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.612
I will make you a bet,

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.684
and I am confident
that I will win the bet.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:01.527
If you've got two children or more,

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:05.356
I bet you they are completely
different from each other.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.801
Aren't they?

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.727
(Applause)

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.330
You would never confuse them, would you?

00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:14.394
Like, "Which one are you? Remind me."

00:04:14.418 --> 00:04:16.196
(Laughter)

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:19.665
"Your mother and I need
some color-coding system

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.069
so we don't get confused."

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.971
Education under "No Child Left Behind"

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:28.574
is based on not diversity but conformity.

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:32.352
What schools are encouraged
to do is to find out

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:36.324
what kids can do across
a very narrow spectrum of achievement.

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.404
One of the effects
of "No Child Left Behind"

00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:43.177
has been to narrow the focus
onto the so-called STEM disciplines.

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:44.811
They're very important.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.074
I'm not here to argue
against science and math.

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:50.813
On the contrary, they're necessary
but they're not sufficient.

00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:53.353
A real education has to give equal weight

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:57.090
to the arts, the humanities,
to physical education.

00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:59.538
An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you --

00:04:59.562 --> 00:05:04.664
(Applause)

00:05:04.688 --> 00:05:08.551
One estimate in America currently
is that something like 10 percent of kids,

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.066
getting on that way,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.156
are being diagnosed
with various conditions

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.157
under the broad title
of attention deficit disorder.

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:19.702
ADHD.

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:22.017
I'm not saying there's no such thing.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.130
I just don't believe
it's an epidemic like this.

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:27.946
If you sit kids down, hour after hour,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.925
doing low-grade clerical work,

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:34.411
don't be surprised if they start
to fidget, you know?

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:35.863
(Laughter)

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:42.065
(Applause)

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.224
Children are not, for the most part,
suffering from a psychological condition.

00:05:46.248 --> 00:05:48.237
They're suffering from childhood.

00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:52.355
(Laughter)

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.287
And I know this because
I spent my early life as a child.

00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:57.406
I went through the whole thing.

00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:03.699
Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum
that celebrates their various talents,

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:05.336
not just a small range of them.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.559
And by the way, the arts
aren't just important

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.193
because they improve math scores.

00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:12.334
They're important because they speak
to parts of children's being

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:13.787
which are otherwise untouched.

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:16.120
The second, thank you --

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:20.205
(Applause)

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:24.701
The second principle
that drives human life flourishing

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.209
is curiosity.

00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:29.876
If you can light the spark
of curiosity in a child,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.068
they will learn without any further
assistance, very often.

00:06:33.563 --> 00:06:35.524
Children are natural learners.

00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:39.840
It's a real achievement
to put that particular ability out,

00:06:39.864 --> 00:06:41.241
or to stifle it.

00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:45.868
Curiosity is the engine of achievement.

00:06:46.392 --> 00:06:47.745
Now the reason I say this

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:51.944
is because one of the effects
of the current culture here,

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:53.170
if I can say so,

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:56.077
has been to de-professionalize teachers.

00:06:56.876 --> 00:07:02.188
There is no system in the world
or any school in the country

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:04.476
that is better than its teachers.

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:09.334
Teachers are the lifeblood
of the success of schools.

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:12.350
But teaching is a creative profession.

00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:15.701
Teaching, properly conceived,
is not a delivery system.

00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:19.222
You know, you're not there just
to pass on received information.

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:21.474
Great teachers do that,

00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:24.543
but what great teachers also do is mentor,

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:27.595
stimulate, provoke, engage.

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:30.230
You see, in the end,
education is about learning.

00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:33.971
If there's no learning going on,
there's no education going on.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.968
And people can spend an awful lot of time

00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:38.565
discussing education
without ever discussing learning.

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:41.162
The whole point of education
is to get people to learn.

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:44.952
An old friend of mine --
actually very old, he's dead.

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:47.648
(Laughter)

00:07:47.672 --> 00:07:50.149
That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.129
(Laughter)

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.713
But a wonderful guy he was,
wonderful philosopher.

00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:01.012
He used to talk about the difference

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:04.927
between the task
and achievement senses of verbs.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.141
You can be engaged
in the activity of something,

00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:10.580
but not really be
achieving it, like dieting.

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:12.087
(Laughter)

00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:13.841
It's a very good example.

00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:15.212
There he is. He's dieting.

00:08:15.236 --> 00:08:17.105
Is he losing any weight? Not really.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.721
(Laughter)

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.212
Teaching is a word like that.

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:23.424
You can say, "There's Deborah,
she's in room 34, she's teaching."

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.751
But if nobody's learning anything,

00:08:25.775 --> 00:08:29.590
she may be engaged in the task of teaching
but not actually fulfilling it.

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:33.384
The role of a teacher
is to facilitate learning.

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:34.655
That's it.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.555
And part of the problem is, I think,

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:40.011
that the dominant culture
of education has come to focus

00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.124
on not teaching and learning, but testing.

00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:45.461
Now, testing is important.

00:08:45.485 --> 00:08:47.200
Standardized tests have a place.

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:50.691
But they should not be
the dominant culture of education.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.811
They should be diagnostic.
They should help.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:59.835
(Applause)

00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:04.769
If I go for a medical examination,
I want some standardized tests.

00:09:05.162 --> 00:09:06.363
I do.

00:09:06.387 --> 00:09:08.474
I want to know
what my cholesterol level is

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.855
compared to everybody else's
on a standard scale.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:14.121
I don't want to be told on some scale
my doctor invented in the car.

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:15.533
(Laughter)

00:09:16.246 --> 00:09:18.469
"Your cholesterol
is what I call Level Orange."

00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:19.676
"Really?"

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.477
(Laughter)

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:23.144
"Is that good?" "We don't know."

00:09:23.168 --> 00:09:24.722
(Laughter)

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:27.312
But all that should support learning.

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:30.844
It shouldn't obstruct it,
which of course it often does.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:35.362
So in place of curiosity,
what we have is a culture of compliance.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:41.475
Our children and teachers are encouraged
to follow routine algorithms

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:46.036
rather than to excite that power
of imagination and curiosity.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.692
And the third principle is this:
that human life is inherently creative.

00:09:50.065 --> 00:09:52.429
It's why we all have different résumés.

00:09:52.453 --> 00:09:54.070
We create our lives,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.673
and we can recreate them
as we go through them.

00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:59.278
It's the common currency
of being a human being.

00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:03.445
It's why human culture
is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.306
I mean, other animals may well have
imaginations and creativity,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.038
but it's not so much
in evidence, is it, as ours?

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:11.566
I mean, you may have a dog.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.174
And your dog may get depressed.

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:18.216
You know, but it doesn't listen
to Radiohead, does it?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.995
(Laughter)

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.924
And sit staring out the window
with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:29.121
(Laughter)

00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:30.947
"Would you like to come for a walk?"

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:32.172
"No, I'm fine."

00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:33.930
(Laughter)

00:10:33.954 --> 00:10:37.771
"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:39.636
(Laughter)

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.409
We all create our own lives
through this restless process

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.529
of imagining alternatives
and possibilities,

00:10:44.553 --> 00:10:46.995
and one of the roles of education

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:50.693
is to awaken and develop
these powers of creativity.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:53.755
Instead, what we have
is a culture of standardization.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.639
Now, it doesn't have to be that way.

00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:58.248
It really doesn't.

00:10:58.637 --> 00:11:03.317
Finland regularly comes out on top
in math, science and reading.

00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:05.611
Now, we only know
that's what they do well at,

00:11:05.635 --> 00:11:07.767
because that's all that's being tested.

00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:09.649
That's one of the problems of the test.

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:12.411
They don't look for other things
that matter just as much.

00:11:12.752 --> 00:11:16.078
The thing about work in Finland is this:

00:11:16.102 --> 00:11:18.450
they don't obsess about those disciplines.

00:11:18.474 --> 00:11:20.570
They have a very broad
approach to education,

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:23.964
which includes humanities,
physical education, the arts.

00:11:25.064 --> 00:11:29.817
Second, there is no standardized
testing in Finland.

00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.128
I mean, there's a bit,

00:11:32.152 --> 00:11:34.438
but it's not what gets
people up in the morning,

00:11:34.462 --> 00:11:36.009
what keeps them at their desks.

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:38.698
The third thing --
and I was at a meeting recently

00:11:38.722 --> 00:11:41.263
with some people from Finland,
actual Finnish people,

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:46.159
and somebody from the American system
was saying to the people in Finland,

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:49.132
"What do you do
about the drop-out rate in Finland?"

00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.188
And they all looked a bit
bemused, and said,

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.514
"Well, we don't have one.

00:11:54.522 --> 00:11:55.885
Why would you drop out?

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.141
If people are in trouble,
we get to them quite quickly

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:00.633
and we help and support them."

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:02.224
Now people always say,

00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:05.006
"Well, you know, you can't compare
Finland to America."

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:08.847
No. I think there's a population
of around five million in Finland.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.185
But you can compare it
to a state in America.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:16.225
Many states in America
have fewer people in them than that.

00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:18.767
I mean, I've been
to some states in America

00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:20.348
and I was the only person there.

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:22.175
(Laughter)

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.800
Really. Really.

00:12:24.824 --> 00:12:26.778
I was asked to lock up when I left.

00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:30.048
(Laughter)

00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:34.806
But what all the high-performing
systems in the world do

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.694
is currently what is not evident, sadly,

00:12:38.718 --> 00:12:40.959
across the systems in America --

00:12:40.983 --> 00:12:42.250
I mean, as a whole.

00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:44.012
One is this:

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:47.053
they individualize teaching and learning.

00:12:47.797 --> 00:12:51.430
They recognize that it's students
who are learning

00:12:51.454 --> 00:12:53.586
and the system has to engage them,

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.996
their curiosity, their individuality,
and their creativity.

00:12:57.305 --> 00:12:58.931
That's how you get them to learn.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.760
The second is that they attribute
a very high status

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.627
to the teaching profession.

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:08.985
They recognize
that you can't improve education

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:11.978
if you don't pick great people to teach
and keep giving them

00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:14.199
constant support
and professional development.

00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:17.195
Investing in professional
development is not a cost.

00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:18.808
It's an investment,

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:21.577
and every other country
that's succeeding well knows that,

00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:24.031
whether it's Australia, Canada,

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:28.482
South Korea, Singapore,
Hong Kong or Shanghai.

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:30.171
They know that to be the case.

00:13:30.195 --> 00:13:31.561
And the third is,

00:13:31.585 --> 00:13:35.315
they devolve responsibility
to the school level

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:36.592
for getting the job done.

00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:39.348
You see, there's a big difference here

00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:43.361
between going into a mode of command
and control in education --

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:45.113
That's what happens in some systems.

00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:47.736
Central or state governments decide,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.418
they know best and they're going
to tell you what to do.

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:54.294
The trouble is that education
doesn't go on

00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:57.226
in the committee rooms
of our legislative buildings.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.260
It happens in classrooms and schools,

00:14:00.284 --> 00:14:03.333
and the people who do it
are the teachers and the students,

00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:06.606
and if you remove their discretion,
it stops working.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:09.791
You have to put it back to the people.

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:14.967
(Applause)

00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:17.332
There is wonderful work
happening in this country.

00:14:17.918 --> 00:14:19.475
But I have to say it's happening

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:22.041
in spite of the dominant
culture of education,

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.442
not because of it.

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:26.713
It's like people are sailing
into a headwind all the time.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.708
And the reason I think is this:

00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:31.740
that many of the current policies

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:35.885
are based on mechanistic
conceptions of education.

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:39.653
It's like education
is an industrial process

00:14:39.677 --> 00:14:42.660
that can be improved
just by having better data,

00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:45.600
and somewhere in the back of the mind
of some policy makers

00:14:45.624 --> 00:14:49.734
is this idea that if we fine-tune it
well enough, if we just get it right,

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:52.019
it will all hum along perfectly
into the future.

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:54.291
It won't, and it never did.

00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:59.732
The point is that education
is not a mechanical system.

00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:01.555
It's a human system.

00:15:01.927 --> 00:15:03.856
It's about people,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.684
people who either do want
to learn or don't want to learn.

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:11.499
Every student who drops
out of school has a reason for it

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:13.820
which is rooted in their own biography.

00:15:13.844 --> 00:15:15.422
They may find it boring.

00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:17.142
They may find it irrelevant.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:21.980
They may find that it's at odds with
the life they're living outside of school.

00:15:22.286 --> 00:15:25.454
There are trends,
but the stories are always unique.

00:15:26.087 --> 00:15:28.741
I was at a meeting recently
in Los Angeles of --

00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:31.200
they're called alternative
education programs.

00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:34.528
These are programs designed
to get kids back into education.

00:15:34.552 --> 00:15:36.333
They have certain common features.

00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:37.889
They're very personalized.

00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:41.960
They have strong support for the teachers,

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:45.527
close links with the community
and a broad and diverse curriculum,

00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:50.447
and often programs which involve students
outside school as well as inside school.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.004
And they work.

00:15:52.674 --> 00:15:56.347
What's interesting to me is,
these are called "alternative education."

00:15:56.371 --> 00:15:57.419
(Laughter)

00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:58.647
You know?

00:15:59.714 --> 00:16:01.909
And all the evidence
from around the world is,

00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:04.865
if we all did that, there'd be
no need for the alternative.

00:16:05.406 --> 00:16:08.262
(Applause)

00:16:13.135 --> 00:16:14.136
(Applause ends)

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.640
So I think we have to embrace
a different metaphor.

00:16:16.664 --> 00:16:19.173
We have to recognize
that it's a human system,

00:16:19.197 --> 00:16:23.053
and there are conditions
under which people thrive,

00:16:23.077 --> 00:16:25.674
and conditions under which they don't.

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:28.945
We are after all organic creatures,

00:16:28.969 --> 00:16:33.245
and the culture of the school
is absolutely essential.

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.344
Culture is an organic term, isn't it?

00:16:35.937 --> 00:16:38.972
Not far from where I live
is a place called Death Valley.

00:16:39.627 --> 00:16:45.267
Death Valley is the hottest,
driest place in America,

00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.110
and nothing grows there.

00:16:48.219 --> 00:16:50.306
Nothing grows there
because it doesn't rain.

00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:52.280
Hence, Death Valley.

00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:59.670
In the winter of 2004,
it rained in Death Valley.

00:17:00.064 --> 00:17:03.201
Seven inches of rain fell
over a very short period.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.705
And in the spring of 2005,
there was a phenomenon.

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:14.660
The whole floor of Death Valley
was carpeted in flowers for a while.

00:17:15.664 --> 00:17:17.426
What it proved is this:

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.084
that Death Valley isn't dead.

00:17:21.424 --> 00:17:22.693
It's dormant.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.027
Right beneath the surface
are these seeds of possibility

00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:30.589
waiting for the right conditions
to come about,

00:17:30.613 --> 00:17:34.075
and with organic systems,
if the conditions are right,

00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:35.974
life is inevitable.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.661
It happens all the time.

00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:40.246
You take an area, a school, a district,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.674
you change the conditions, give people
a different sense of possibility,

00:17:43.698 --> 00:17:46.816
a different set of expectations,
a broader range of opportunities,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.126
you cherish and value the relationships
between teachers and learners,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.341
you offer people
the discretion to be creative

00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:54.184
and to innovate in what they do,

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:57.645
and schools that were once
bereft spring to life.

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:59.154
Great leaders know that.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.763
The real role of leadership
in education --

00:18:01.787 --> 00:18:03.884
and I think it's true
at the national level,

00:18:03.908 --> 00:18:05.878
the state level, at the school level --

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:09.376
is not and should not be
command and control.

00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:14.525
The real role of leadership
is climate control,

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:16.828
creating a climate of possibility.

00:18:16.852 --> 00:18:19.282
And if you do that, people will rise to it

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.515
and achieve things
that you completely did not anticipate

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:24.482
and couldn't have expected.

00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:26.859
There's a wonderful quote
from Benjamin Franklin.

00:18:26.883 --> 00:18:29.462
"There are three sorts
of people in the world:

00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:32.002
Those who are immovable,

00:18:32.026 --> 00:18:33.249
people who don't get it,

00:18:33.273 --> 00:18:35.144
or don't want to do anything about it;

00:18:35.168 --> 00:18:36.880
there are people who are movable,

00:18:36.904 --> 00:18:38.524
people who see the need for change

00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:40.848
and are prepared to listen to it;

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:42.699
and there are people who move,

00:18:42.723 --> 00:18:44.479
people who make things happen."

00:18:44.796 --> 00:18:48.718
And if we can encourage more people,
that will be a movement.

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.502
And if the movement is strong enough,

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:54.251
that's, in the best sense
of the word, a revolution.

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:56.423
And that's what we need.

00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:57.656
Thank you very much.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.545
(Applause)

00:19:01.569 --> 00:19:02.795
Thank you very much.

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:05.396
(Applause)
