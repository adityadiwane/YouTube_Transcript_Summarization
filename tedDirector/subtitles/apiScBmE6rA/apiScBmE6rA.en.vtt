00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.151
So, stepping down out of the bus,

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.896
I headed back to the corner

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:23.284
to head west en route to a braille training session.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.394
It was the winter of 2009,

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:27.815
and I had been blind for about a year.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.948
Things were going pretty well.

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.855
Safely reaching the other side,

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:33.316
I turned to the left,

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:35.920
pushed the auto-button for
the audible pedestrian signal,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.844
and waited my turn.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:39.933
As it went off, I took off

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.606
and safely got to the other side.

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.702
Stepping onto the sidewalk,

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:46.396
I then heard the sound of a steel chair

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:50.552
slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:52.469
I know there's a cafe on the corner,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.115
and they have chairs out in front,

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:55.511
so I just adjusted to the left

00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:57.355
to get closer to the street.

00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:00.995
As I did, so slid the chair.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.076
I just figured I'd made a mistake,

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:04.914
and went back to the right,

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.409
and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.774
Now I was getting a little anxious.

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:12.387
I went back to the left,

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.676
and so slid the chair,

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:16.284
blocking my path of travel.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.286
Now, I was officially freaking out.

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.871
So I yelled,

00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.132
"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:26.384
Just then, over my shout,

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:29.069
I heard something else, a familiar rattle.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.915
It sounded familiar,

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:32.778
and I quickly considered another possibility,

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:34.709
and I reached out with my left hand,

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.113
as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.664
and I came across an ear,

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:44.926
the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:46.915
Its leash had been tied to the chair

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:48.652
as her master went in for coffee,

00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:50.444
and she was just persistent in her efforts

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:53.782
to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.

00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.394
Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:58.773
(Laughter)

00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:01.182
But that little story is really about

00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:04.381
the fears and misconceptions that come along

00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:07.284
with the idea of moving through the city

00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:08.607
without sight,

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:11.568
seemingly oblivious to the environment

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.468
and the people around you.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:18.369
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:20.928
On St. Patrick's Day of 2008,

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:23.515
I reported to the hospital for surgery

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:25.709
to remove a brain tumor.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.796
The surgery was successful.

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:30.965
Two days later, my sight started to fail.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:34.487
On the third day, it was gone.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.584
Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense

00:02:36.584 --> 00:02:40.473
of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:42.922
like anybody would.

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.414
But as I had time to stop and think,

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:47.165
I actually started to realize

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.089
I had a lot to be grateful for.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.085
In particular, I thought about my dad,

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.282
who had passed away from complications

00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:57.385
from brain surgery.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:02.476
He was 36. I was seven at the time.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:05.169
So although I had every reason

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.401
to be fearful of what was ahead,

00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:10.035
and had no clue quite what was going to happen,

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:11.793
I was alive.

00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:14.505
My son still had his dad.

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.392
And besides, it's not like I was the first person

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.005
ever to lose their sight.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:20.154
I knew there had to be all sorts of systems

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:22.471
and techniques and training to have

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:25.033
to live a full and meaningful, active life

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.635
without sight.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:28.782
So by the time I was discharged from the hospital

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:31.486
a few days later, I left with a mission,

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:33.616
a mission to get out and get the best training

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:38.780
as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.828
Within six months, I had returned to work.

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:44.430
My training had started.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.090
I even started riding a tandem bike

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.715
with my old cycling buddies,

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:50.412
and was commuting to work on my own,

00:03:50.412 --> 00:03:52.887
walking through town and taking the bus.

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:55.650
It was a lot of hard work.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.917
But what I didn't anticipate

00:03:57.917 --> 00:04:00.889
through that rapid transition

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.637
was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition

00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:08.577
of my sighted experience
up against my unsighted experience

00:04:08.577 --> 00:04:11.250
of the same places and the same people

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.753
within such a short period of time.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:16.649
From that came a lot of insights,

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.146
or outsights, as I called them,

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:21.535
things that I learned since losing my sight.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:24.502
These outsights ranged from the trival

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:26.167
to the profound,

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.735
from the mundane to the humorous.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.752
As an architect, that stark juxtaposition

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:34.266
of my sighted and unsighted experience

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.551
of the same places and the same cities

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.564
within such a short period of time

00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:40.770
has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.944
of the city itself.

00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:45.818
Paramount amongst those

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.812
was the realization that, actually,

00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:51.752
cities are fantastic places for the blind.

00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:54.073
And then I was also surprised

00:04:54.073 --> 00:04:57.441
by the city's propensity for kindness and care

00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:00.921
as opposed to indifference or worse.

00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:02.684
And then I started to realize that

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:04.673
it seemed like the blind seemed to have

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:08.742
a positive influence on the city itself.

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.996
That was a little curious to me.

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:14.556
Let me step back and take a look

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:19.918
at why the city is so good for the blind.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:23.540
Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.411
is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.637
things that you would otherwise maybe ignore.

00:05:30.637 --> 00:05:33.182
It's like a whole new world of sensory information

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:34.631
opens up to you.

00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:36.159
I was really struck by the symphony

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.135
of subtle sounds all around me in the city

00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:40.427
that you can hear and work with

00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:42.309
to understand where you are,

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.114
how you need to move, and where you need to go.

00:05:45.114 --> 00:05:47.838
Similarly, just through the grip of the cane,

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:51.752
you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:54.186
and over time you build a pattern of where you are

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.728
and where you're headed.

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:58.620
Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.449
or the wind at your neck

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.649
gives you clues about your alignment

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:05.342
and your progression through a block

00:06:05.342 --> 00:06:08.847
and your movement through time and space.

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:11.280
But also, the sense of smell.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.981
Some districts and cities have their own smell,

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:17.022
as do places and things around you,

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:18.814
and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:22.243
to that new bakery that you've been looking for.

00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:23.952
All this really surprised me,

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:26.957
because I started to realize that

00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:29.510
my unsighted experienced

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.945
was so far more multi-sensory

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:34.970
than my sighted experience ever was.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.710
What struck me also was how much the city

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.342
was changing around me.

00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:41.079
When you're sighted,

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:43.268
everybody kind of sticks to themselves,

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:45.081
you mind your own business.

00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:46.348
Lose your sight, though,

00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:49.147
and it's a whole other story.

00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:50.626
And I don't know who's watching who,

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:54.175
but I have a suspicion that
a lot of people are watching me.

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.323
And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,

00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:59.352
I'm getting all sorts of advice:

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.672
Go here, move there, watch out for this.

00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.749
A lot of the information is good.

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.235
Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.

00:07:06.235 --> 00:07:09.804
You've got to figure out what they actually meant.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:13.357
Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.

00:07:13.357 --> 00:07:16.368
But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:17.904
But one time I was in Oakland

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:20.791
walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.598
I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,

00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:26.084
and as it went off, I was just about
to step out into the street,

00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:28.116
when all of a sudden, my right hand

00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:29.796
was just gripped by this guy,

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:32.208
and he yanked my arm
and pulled me out into the crosswalk

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:33.882
and was dragging me out across the street,

00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:36.134
speaking to me in Mandarin.

00:07:36.134 --> 00:07:37.542
(Laughter)

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:41.681
It's like, there was no escape
from this man's death grip,

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:43.404
but he got me safely there.

00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:45.754
What could I do?

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.550
But believe me, there are more polite ways

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.723
to offer assistance.

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.245
We don't know you're there,

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:53.225
so it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.

00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.361
"Would you like some help?"

00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:58.412
But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:01.030
how much the city of Oakland changed

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.532
as I lost my sight.

00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:05.699
I liked it sighted. It was fine.

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:08.275
It's a perfectly great city.

00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:09.544
But once I lost my sight

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:11.859
and was walking along Broadway,

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:15.070
I was blessed every block of the way.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.624
"Bless you, man."

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:18.887
"Go for it, brother."

00:08:18.887 --> 00:08:20.637
"God bless you."

00:08:20.637 --> 00:08:22.497
I didn't get that sighted.

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:23.833
(Laughter)

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:30.158
And even without sight,
I don't get that in San Francisco.

00:08:30.158 --> 00:08:33.150
And I know it bothers some of my blind friends,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.743
it's not just me.

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.792
Often it's thought that

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:39.936
that's an emotion that comes up out of pity.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:43.049
I tend to think that it comes
out of our shared humanity,

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.159
out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.019
In fact, if I'm feeling down,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.927
I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:52.586
I go for a walk, and I feel better like that,

00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:55.857
in no time at all.

00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:57.892
But also that it illustrates how

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:59.674
disability and blindness

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.394
sort of cuts across ethnic, social,

00:09:02.394 --> 00:09:05.120
racial, economic lines.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.955
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider.

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:11.398
Everybody's welcome.

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:13.959
In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:16.461
that there are really only two types of people:

00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:18.220
There are those with disabilities,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.882
and there are those that haven't
quite found theirs yet.

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:25.003
It's a different way of thinking about it,

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:27.252
but I think it's kind of beautiful,

00:09:27.252 --> 00:09:29.428
because it is certainly far more inclusive

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.533
than the us-versus-them

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:34.101
or the abled-versus-the-disabled,

00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:36.879
and it's a lot more honest and respectful

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:40.183
of the fragility of life.

00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:42.108
So my final takeaway for you is

00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:46.176
that not only is the city good for the blind,

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:49.355
but the city needs us.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.393
And I'm so sure of that that

00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:52.989
I want to propose to you today

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:56.429
that the blind be taken as
the prototypical city dwellers

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.714
when imagining new and wonderful cities,

00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:01.575
and not the people that are thought about

00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:03.808
after the mold has already been cast.

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:06.861
It's too late then.

00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:10.045
So if you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:14.630
you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.744
with a dense array of options and choices

00:10:16.744 --> 00:10:20.176
all available at the street level.

00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:22.498
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:25.618
sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.

00:10:25.618 --> 00:10:27.971
The space between buildings will be well-balanced

00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:31.410
between people and cars.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.467
In fact, cars, who needs them?

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:38.552
If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)

00:10:38.552 --> 00:10:41.915
They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:44.625
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.268
you design a city with a robust,

00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:50.960
accessible, well-connected mass transit system

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.562
that connects all parts of the city

00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:55.581
and the region all around.

00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:57.647
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:57.647 --> 00:11:00.466
there'll be jobs, lots of jobs.

00:11:00.466 --> 00:11:01.796
Blind people want to work too.

00:11:01.796 --> 00:11:04.235
They want to earn a living.

00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:06.991
So, in designing a city for the blind,

00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:09.060
I hope you start to realize

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.938
that it actually would be a more inclusive,

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:15.544
a more equitable, a more just city for all.

00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:17.764
And based on my prior sighted experience,

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:19.742
it sounds like a pretty cool city,

00:11:19.742 --> 00:11:23.089
whether you're blind, whether you have a disability,

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:25.573
or you haven't quite found yours yet.

00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:28.185
So thank you.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:32.185
(Applause)
