00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:16.684
Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:18.365
in a cowboy hat and chaps,

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:19.543
is in the ring

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:21.974
as the arena full of fans cheer him on.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.447
Their hero:

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:25.249
"Cowboy" Gator Magraw.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.205
Gator bounces off the ropes
and is quickly body-slammed to the mat.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.470
His wild opponent leaps into the air,

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:33.586
crashing down onto Gator's rib cage.

00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.163
Gator struggles to breathe, wondering:

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:39.849
"Is this really what my father
wanted for me?"

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.558
(Laughter)

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:43.732
That wild man in the chaps ...

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.900
was me.

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:46.984
(Laughter)

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:48.649
(Applause)

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:52.399
(Cheers)

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:00.161
And the answer
to the question, surprisingly,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.344
is yes.

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:02.518
(Laughter)

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:05.503
I grew up watching professional wrestling

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:06.705
with my dad.

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:09.385
And like him, I loved everything about it:

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.453
the showmanship, the athletic skill,

00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:12.717
the drama.

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:16.514
I'd be this little boy, bouncing
all over our living room,

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:19.098
pretending to be my favorite
wrestlers from TV.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.161
My dad actually reminded me
a little bit of Hulk Hogan,

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.740
but I was Hulk Hogan
and he was Andre the Giant.

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:27.727
I'd get all serious on him
and say things like, "Dad ...

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.561
someday I am going to be
world heavyweight champion."

00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:35.737
And he would usually smile
and very calmly say,

00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:40.623
"OK, then I guess I can count on you
to be my retirement fund."

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:41.995
(Laughter)

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.174
When I was 16,

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:46.047
a small wrestling show came
to my little town in Minnesota.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.241
I couldn't believe it.

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:49.881
Nothing like that had ever
come to my town before.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.962
So I got to the arena
early in the morning the day of the show,

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:56.225
waiting out in the parking lot
to see if I could spot some wrestlers

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.485
pulling up in their cars.

00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:00.384
It wasn't as creepy as it sounds.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.640
But I could definitely tell
who the wrestlers were,

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:04.894
just the way they walked.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.102
They were tall and confident
and intimidating,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:10.149
with their tank tops
and Zubaz and fanny packs.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.571
Why wouldn't I want to be them?

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:13.828
(Laughter)

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.443
All I could think about
was who are these people,

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:17.917
and what are they like?

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:19.661
How did they become wrestlers?

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.715
So before the show started,

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.006
I walked into this tiny arena --

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.819
more like a gymnasium --

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:28.632
and I asked them if I could help
set up the wrestling ring.

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.269
"Sure, kid. No problem."

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:34.240
And then I pleaded with them
to show me some wrestling moves.

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:36.602
"Sure, kid. No problem."

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.626
Man, they would just punch
and kick me -- hard!

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.467
But I never complained.

00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.027
They would come to my town for one night
every couple of months that year,

00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:47.224
and then -- poof! --
next day, they were gone.

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:48.406
By the next year,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.295
they finally told me about an actual
wrestling training camp

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.146
that one of the wrestlers was running,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.521
and I begged my parents to sign me up.

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:58.413
Next thing I knew,
I was a high school senior by day

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:00.786
and wrestling in front of live
audiences by night.

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:04.975
I had this giant poster of an alligator
hanging on my bedroom wall.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.234
So when I needed to come up with
a wrestling name at the last minute

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:10.558
and Jesse "The Body" Ventura
was already taken --

00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:11.600
(Laughter)

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.904
I went with "Gator."

00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:15.215
I also wrestled in a t-shirt
and camouflage pants

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.537
because that's what I had in my closet.

00:03:18.444 --> 00:03:21.340
I hadn't quite figured out
how to develop my own persona yet,

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:22.515
but I was learning.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.373
It was sort of like an apprenticeship.

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.564
But I was a wrestler.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:27.560
And my dad would come to all my matches

00:03:27.584 --> 00:03:30.463
wearing a t-shirt that said,
"Papa Gator" across the front.

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:31.638
(Laughter)

00:03:31.662 --> 00:03:33.000
And he'd brag to his friends

00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:35.988
about how his son was going to pay
for his retirement someday.

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:37.035
(Laughter)

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.442
And I would've.

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:41.445
Not long after I started wrestling,

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.527
my dad unexpectedly passed away.

00:03:46.254 --> 00:03:48.379
And as you can imagine,

00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:50.459
especially as a teenage boy,

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:51.797
it destroyed me.

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:56.335
If you've ever lost someone,

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.624
you know what a difficult
time that can be.

00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:01.118
Your mind -- it's not working right.

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:02.882
The whole thing is just so surreal.

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:08.673
I wanted to feel normal again,
even if it was for just a second,

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:11.255
so I went back to wrestling
almost immediately.

00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:14.256
Wrestling belonged to me
and my dad, you know?

00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:16.657
So there I was,

00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:18.026
sitting in the locker room,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.379
getting ready for a match within days
of my dad passing away.

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:23.326
He was gone.

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.241
And sitting there alone --

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:28.846
it felt like I was hiding.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.887
But it also felt like
I needed to be there.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.920
One of the wrestlers who'd been
on the scene a long time

00:04:35.944 --> 00:04:37.403
knew what I was going through,

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.695
and he came over to see
how I was holding up.

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.395
I couldn't get the words out.

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.285
I just said, "I don't know
what I'm doing."

00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:47.373
And then we just sat there in silence --

00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:48.998
just ... silence.

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.382
Before he got up to get ready
for his own match,

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:54.922
he gave me this piece of advice

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:57.544
that would change the entire
direction of my life.

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:01.784
He told me the best wrestlers
are just themselves, but "turned up."

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:06.438
He said successful wrestlers
find the traits within themselves

00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:07.780
they're the strongest at

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:10.669
and make those the focus
of who they become in the ring.

00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:13.361
So there I sat --

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.456
a scared teenager
who didn't know who he was

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.619
or why he was even wrestling anymore.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.372
I looked around the locker room
at some of the other wrestlers,

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:22.570
and I thought,

00:05:22.594 --> 00:05:25.110
"I look so different.
How can I ever be like them?"

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:26.992
And then it hit me.

00:05:27.422 --> 00:05:30.363
That's the moment I realized
I didn't have to be like them.

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.219
What I did have to do was find out:
What did it mean to be me?

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.321
What made me unique,

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:38.209
and how could I use it to my advantage?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.819
I knew I wasn't a chiseled athlete
like some of these guys,

00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:43.133
but I really didn't care.

00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:44.742
So the first thing I thought was,

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.555
"How can I amplify something as simple
as: comfortable with my own body?"

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.520
I didn't know.

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.509
And then I thought:

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.518
Speedo.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:57.140
(Laughter)

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.011
(Applause)

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:05.785
Or "trunks,"

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.212
as we call them in wrestling.

00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:09.054
Yeah, trunks.

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:10.238
I could be this big guy

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.513
who was comfortable
wearing these little trunks

00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:14.129
in front of a bunch of strangers.

00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:16.316
So I ditched the t-shirt
and camouflage pants,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.086
and Gator's new wardrobe was born.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.463
(Laughter)

00:06:19.487 --> 00:06:21.562
I was also pretty good
at drawing cartoons,

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.460
so I wondered if I could turn that up.

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.267
I could design my own wrestling costumes,

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:29.539
so each pair of trunks would have
its own unique design and color,

00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:31.736
all of them completely different --

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.862
and extremely comfortable, by the way.

00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:35.036
(Laughter)

00:06:35.672 --> 00:06:37.610
And I was also the funny kid in school,

00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:38.784
believe it or not.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.235
So I thought maybe I could turn that up.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.728
Maybe I could go from the boy
who made his buddies laugh

00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:48.786
to the man who could rally
hundreds or thousands.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.097
So I committed to the idea

00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.392
that my character wasn't going to be
as scary as some of the others.

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:56.232
I'd be hilarious from the moment
I walked into the arena.

00:06:56.256 --> 00:06:58.564
With every wrestling match, I dug deeper.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.143
I found out that I could laugh at myself.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.581
So this guy would dance
and sing his entrance music

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:05.118
all the way to the ring.

00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:06.772
That was dancing, by the way.

00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:08.113
(Laughter)

00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:09.964
I found out that I was an OK wrestler,

00:07:09.988 --> 00:07:11.822
but I was an even better entertainer.

00:07:11.846 --> 00:07:14.908
And turning myself up made me
unforgettable to the fans.

00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:17.111
I was trying to find
those things about me --

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:18.965
the simple things that were special,

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:21.249
and then ask, "How can I turn them up?"

00:07:21.884 --> 00:07:25.562
Now, I knew I wanted my character
to be a man's man like my dad was.

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:29.821
I thought, "What's more
of a man's man than a cowboy?"

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:34.649
And that's when Gator became
"Cowboy" ... Gator ...

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.317
Yeah, I needed a last name.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.186
I thought about it until my head hurt.
I couldn't come up with anything.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.580
I'm sitting there watching TV one night,
flipping through the channels,

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:45.952
and this commercial comes on

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:49.432
about a country singer who had just won
an Entertainer of the Year award.

00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:50.614
Tim McGraw.

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.645
He's a cool cowboy with a great last name.

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:53.844
And I liked his music.

00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:55.875
It was just all part of my process.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.634
But I just kept turning myself up

00:07:57.658 --> 00:08:01.592
until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw!

00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:03.627
(Laughter)

00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:07.519
(Applause)

00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:13.857
And I knew that if I kept
turning myself up

00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.390
and pushing myself harder,

00:08:15.414 --> 00:08:16.836
the opportunities would come.

00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.442
And then it finally happened.

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:21.471
In the middle of the night,

00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:22.801
I got a phone call.

00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:26.853
It was the call I wish
my dad was around to hear.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.075
The WWE,

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:32.839
the biggest wrestling
organization in the world,

00:08:32.863 --> 00:08:36.411
wanted me to come and be a part
of Monday Night Raw.

00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:41.556
Yes -- all of my hard work and miles
on the road were finally paying off.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.152
I got to walk down the WWE Raw
entrance ramp on live television --

00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:48.326
(Laughter)

00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:51.818
dressed up as a fake security guard --

00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:52.850
(Laughter)

00:08:52.874 --> 00:08:54.827
to escort another wrestler to the ring.

00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:56.454
(Laughter)

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:59.626
Sure, I was disappointed
I didn't get to wrestle,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.563
but very few wrestlers get
any kind of call from the WWE.

00:09:02.587 --> 00:09:04.454
Maybe one in a few hundred.

00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:08.163
And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw
is what got me there.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.709
So instead of walking away that day,

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:13.674
I decided to turn myself up again

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:15.870
and become the best
security guard I could.

00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:17.732
In fact, I did it so well,

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:20.499
I was the only guard to get
a close-up on TV that night.

00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:23.378
That's a big deal, you know?

00:09:23.402 --> 00:09:24.627
(Laughter)

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:28.897
And I got to sit backstage that entire day

00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:31.619
with some of the most famous
pro wrestlers in the world,

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:33.736
some of which were heroes
of mine as a kid.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.563
And I got to listen to them
and learn from them,

00:09:36.587 --> 00:09:38.613
and for that day,

00:09:38.637 --> 00:09:40.457
I was accepted as one of them.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.610
Maybe my experience
with the WWE wasn't ideal.

00:09:44.634 --> 00:09:46.323
I mean, I didn't get to wrestle.

00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:49.236
But it made me work harder,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.031
turning myself up louder year after year.

00:09:52.055 --> 00:09:55.093
I was becoming the biggest
version of myself in the ring,

00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:56.721
and other people took notice.

00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:58.649
Before I knew it,

00:09:58.673 --> 00:10:01.603
I'd gone from wrestling
maybe once a month in Minnesota

00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:04.551
to as often as four times a week
all over the United States

00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:06.723
on the independent wrestling circuit.

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:08.627
I was literally living my dream.

00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.155
While wrestling over the next few years,

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.085
I suffered a pretty bad shoulder injury

00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:17.478
right around the same time
my wife and I found out

00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:19.403
that we were expecting our first child.

00:10:19.427 --> 00:10:20.770
I know what you're thinking,

00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:24.068
but believe me when I say
those two events are completely unrelated.

00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:27.334
(Laughter)

00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:33.272
But I needed shoulder surgery,

00:10:33.296 --> 00:10:35.232
and I wanted to be home with my family.

00:10:35.763 --> 00:10:37.276
It was my turn to be a dad.

00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:41.538
So on July 27, 2007,

00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:43.480
I wrestled my final match,

00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:45.526
and walked away
from professional wrestling

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.383
to pursue the next chapter of my life.

00:10:48.268 --> 00:10:49.478
And as time passed,

00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:51.436
the strangest thing started to happen.

00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:54.169
I found out that once someone
has been turned up,

00:10:54.193 --> 00:10:56.023
it's pretty hard to turn them down.

00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:59.023
I left the ring but Gator stayed with me,

00:10:59.047 --> 00:11:01.969
and I use the turned-up version
of myself every day.

00:11:02.854 --> 00:11:05.973
My beautiful wife has been with me
through this entire journey.

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:09.219
And by the way --
she does not like pro wrestling.

00:11:09.243 --> 00:11:10.464
(Laughter)

00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:11.638
Like, at all.

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:14.763
But she was always my biggest fan.

00:11:14.787 --> 00:11:15.937
She still is.

00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:20.042
She knows there's always going to be
some part of Gator Magraw in here,

00:11:20.066 --> 00:11:23.090
and she wants our daughter and twin sons
to discover themselves

00:11:23.114 --> 00:11:24.273
the way that I did,

00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:27.592
but probably with fewer body slams
and steel chair shots to the head.

00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:30.307
I mean, do you know how many times
she's had to remind me

00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:33.075
not to clothesline the referees
at my kid's soccer games?

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:34.114
(Laughter)

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:35.742
I mean, it was just the one time,

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:37.444
and my daughter was clearly fouled!

00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:38.618
(Laughter)

00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:43.855
As a parent now, I've begun to realize
that my dad wanted something

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:46.068
much more valuable than a retirement fund.

00:11:46.092 --> 00:11:47.374
Like most parents,

00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:50.167
he just wanted his kids
to reach their fullest potential.

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.439
I'm trying to teach my children

00:11:52.463 --> 00:11:56.084
that turning yourself up is just not some
perfect idea of how to be great,

00:11:56.108 --> 00:11:57.805
it's a way of living --

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.102
constantly looking
for what makes you different

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:02.430
and how you can amplify it
for the world to see.

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:05.805
And by the way, my kids
don't like wrestling, either.

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:06.939
(Laughter)

00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:08.131
But that's OK with me,

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:11.465
because they each have their own
unique talents that can be turned up

00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:12.803
just like the rest of us.

00:12:12.827 --> 00:12:15.549
My one son -- he's a whiz at electronics.

00:12:15.573 --> 00:12:19.284
So maybe helping him turn up
makes him become the next Steve Jobs.

00:12:20.062 --> 00:12:22.831
My other son and my daughter --
they're great at art,

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:24.912
so maybe helping them turn up their gifts

00:12:24.936 --> 00:12:27.310
helps them become the next Pablo Picasso.

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:30.447
You never know what
you have the ability to do

00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:31.676
until you dig.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.890
And don't be afraid
to put yourself out there.

00:12:34.914 --> 00:12:36.068
I mean, look around.

00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:38.787
They say that if you get nervous
in front of an audience,

00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:40.778
just imagine them in their underwear.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.042
But then I think, "Hey,
I've wrestled in less."

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:44.969
(Laughter)

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:49.805
(Applause)

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:56.162
Look, the wrestling circus doesn't need
to come to your town

00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:58.538
before you get an invitation
to be the real you --

00:12:58.562 --> 00:13:00.725
the bigger, more stunning
version of yourself.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.629
It doesn't even necessarily
come from our parents.

00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:07.229
Turning yourself up means looking inward
toward our true selves

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:08.968
and harnessing the voice that says,

00:13:08.992 --> 00:13:10.991
"Maybe, just maybe,

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:12.864
I am more than I thought I was."

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:14.660
Thank you.

00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:19.150
(Applause)
