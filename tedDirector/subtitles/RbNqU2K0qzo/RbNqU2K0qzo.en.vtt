00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.816
This is one of the most amazing animals
on the face of the Earth.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.936
This is a tapir.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.616
Now this, this is a baby tapir,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.576
the cutest animal offspring
in the animal kingdom.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.976
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.576
By far.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.240
There is no competition here.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.216
I have dedicated
the past 20 years of my life

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.416
to the research and conservation
of tapirs in Brazil,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.136
and it has been absolutely amazing.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.656
But at the moment,
I've been thinking really, really hard

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.096
about the impact of my work.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.216
I've been questioning myself
about the real contributions I have made

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.776
for the conservation
of these animals I love so much.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.656
Am I being effective

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.656
in safeguarding their survival?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.016
Am I doing enough?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.336
I guess the big question here is,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.736
am I studying tapirs
and contributing to their conservation,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.200
or am I just documenting their extinction?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.696
The world is facing
so many different conservation crises.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.056
We all know that.
It's all over the news every day.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.376
Tropical forests and other ecosystems
are being destroyed,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.656
climate change, so many species
on the brink of extinction:

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.280
tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.936
This is the lowland tapir,
the tapir species I work with,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.096
the largest terrestrial mammal
of South America.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.656
They're massive. They're powerful.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.216
Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.336
That's half the size of a horse.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.176
They're gorgeous.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.096
Tapirs are mostly found
in tropical forests such as the Amazon,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.576
and they absolutely need
large patches of habitat

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.136
in order to find all the resources
they need to reproduce and survive.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.096
But their habitat is being destroyed,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.616
and they have been hunted out of several
parts of their geographic distribution.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.376
And you see, this is
very, very unfortunate

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.776
because tapirs are extremely important
for the habitats where they are found.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.176
They're herbivores.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.536
Fifty percent of their diet
consists of fruit,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.456
and when they eat the fruit,
they swallow the seeds,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.096
which they disperse throughout
the habitat through their feces.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.656
They play this major role
in shaping and maintaining

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.136
the structure and diversity of the forest,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.296
and for that reason, tapirs are known
as gardeners of the forest.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.056
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.896
If you think about it,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.976
the extinction of tapirs
would seriously affect

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.896
biodiversity as a whole.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.816
I started my tapir work in 1996,
still very young, fresh out of college,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.176
and it was a pioneer research
and conservation program.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.536
At that point, we had nearly
zero information about tapirs,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.856
mostly because they're
so difficult to study.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.416
They're nocturnal, solitary,
very elusive animals,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.616
and we got started getting
very basic data about these animals.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.496
But what is it
that a conservationist does?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.776
Well, first, we need data.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.376
We need field research.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.016
We need those long-term datasets
to support conservation action,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.056
and I told you tapirs
are very hard to study,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.016
so we have to rely
on indirect methods to study them.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.736
We have to capture and anesthetize them

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.216
so that we can install GPS collars
around their necks

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.896
and follow their movements,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.336
which is a technique used by many
other conservationists around the world.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.296
And then we can gather information
about how they use space,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.376
how they move through the landscape,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.376
what are their priority habitats,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.456
and so much more.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.416
Next, we must disseminate what we learn.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.136
We have to educate people about tapirs

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.776
and how important these animals are.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.416
And it's amazing
how many people around the world

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.256
do not know what a tapir is.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.480
In fact, many people think
this is a tapir.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.416
Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.856
(Laughter)

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.816
This is a giant anteater.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.360
Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.176
And then next we have to provide
training, capacity building.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.656
It is our responsibility to prepare
the conservationists of the future.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.736
We are losing several
conservation battles,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.216
and we need more people doing what we do,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.616
and they need the skills,
and they need the passion to do that.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.176
Ultimately, we conservationists,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.816
we must be able to apply our data,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.056
to apply our accumulated knowledge

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.016
to support actual conservation action.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.016
Our first tapir program

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.296
took place in the Atlantic Forest

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.456
in the eastern part of Brazil,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.856
one of the most threatened
biomes in the world.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.056
The destruction of the Atlantic Forest

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.296
began in the early 1500s,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.096
when the Portuguese
first arrived in Brazil,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.536
beginning European colonization
in the eastern part of South America.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.856
This forest was almost completely cleared

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.096
for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching
and the construction of cities,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.576
and today only seven percent
of the Atlantic forest

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.776
is still left standing.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.176
And tapirs are found in very, very small,
isolated, disconnected populations.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.856
In the Atlantic Forest, we found out
that tapirs move through open areas

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.216
of pastureland and agriculture

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.456
going from one patch of forest
to patch of forest.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.016
So our main approach in this region

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.416
was to use our tapir data
to identify the potential places

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.416
for the establishment
of wildlife corridors

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.096
in between those patches of forest,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.176
reconnecting the habitat

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.936
so that tapirs and many other animals
could cross the landscape safely.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.696
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.736
in 2008, we expanded our tapir
conservation efforts to the Pantanal

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.736
in the western part of Brazil

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.136
near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.576
This is the largest continuous
freshwater floodplain in the world,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.056
an incredible place

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.736
and one of the most important strongholds
for lowland tapirs in South America.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.256
And working in the Pantanal
has been extremely refreshing

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.256
because we found large,
healthy tapir populations in the area,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.216
and we have been able to study tapirs

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.976
in the most natural conditions
we'll ever find,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.840
very much free of threats.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.976
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,
we are using another technique:

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.216
camera traps.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.136
This camera is equipped
with a movement sensor

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.176
and it photographs animals
when they walk in front of it.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.656
So thanks to these amazing devices,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.896
we have been able
to gather precious information

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.856
about tapir reproduction
and social organization

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.416
which are very important
pieces of the puzzle

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.536
when you're trying to develop
those conservation strategies.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.256
And right now, 2015,
we are expanding our work once again

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.136
to the Brazilian Cerrado,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.336
the open grasslands and shrub forests
in the central part of Brazil.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.256
Today this region is the very epicenter
of economic development in my country,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.976
where natural habitat
and wildlife populations

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.096
are rapidly being eradicated
by several different threats,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.696
including once again cattle ranching,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.456
large sugarcane and soybean plantations,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.976
poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.616
And somehow, tapirs are still there,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.056
which gives me a lot of hope.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.576
But I have to say that starting
this new program in the Cerrado

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.456
was a bit of a slap in the face.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.936
When you drive around

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.776
and you find dead tapirs
along the highways

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.816
and signs of tapirs wandering around
in the middle of sugarcane plantations

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.856
where they shouldn't be,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.096
and you talk to kids and they tell you
that they know how tapir meat tastes

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.496
because their families poach and eat them,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.760
it really breaks your heart.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.256
The situation in the Cerrado
made me realize --

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.216
it gave me the sense of urgency.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.535
I am swimming against the tide.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:58.216
It made me realize that despite
two decades of hard work

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.776
trying to save these animals,
we still have so much work to do

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.856
if we are to prevent them
from disappearing.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.816
We have to find ways
to solve all these problems.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.696
We really do, and you know what?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.136
We really came to a point
in the conservation world

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.896
where we have to think out of the box.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.656
We'll have to be a lot more creative
than we are right now.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.576
And I told you, roadkill is a big problem
for tapirs in the Cerrado,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.016
so we just came up with the idea
of putting reflective stickers

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.856
on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.216
These are the same stickers
used on big trucks

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.856
to avoid collision.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.096
Tapirs cross the highways after dark,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.296
so the stickers will hopefully
help drivers see this shining thing

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.736
crossing the highway,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.296
and maybe they will
slow down a little bit.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.896
For now, this is just a crazy idea.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.576
We don't know. We'll see if it will
reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.600
But the point is, maybe this is
the kind of stuff that needs to be done.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.656
And although I'm struggling
with all these questions

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.456
in my mind right now,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.376
I have a pact with tapirs.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.136
I know in my heart

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.096
that tapir conservation is my cause.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.816
This is my passion.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.376
I am not alone.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.136
I have this huge network
of supporters behind me,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.176
and there is no way
I'm ever going to stop.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.576
I will continue doing this,
most probably for the rest of my life.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.896
And I'll keep doing this
for Patrícia, my namesake,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.696
one of the first tapirs we captured
and monitored in the Atlantic Forest

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.816
many, many years ago;

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.376
for Rita and her baby Vincent
in the Pantanal.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.496
And I'll keep doing this for Ted,
a baby tapir we captured

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.936
in December last year
also in the Pantanal.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.056
And I will keep doing this

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.736
for the hundreds of tapirs
that I've had the pleasure to meet

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.976
over the years

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.536
and the many others I know
I will encounter in the future.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.896
These animals deserve to be cared for.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.896
They need me. They need us.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.896
And you know? We human beings
deserve to live in a world

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.816
where we can get out there
and see and benefit from

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.496
not only tapirs

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.336
but all the other beautiful species,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.176
now and in the future.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.296
Thank you so much.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.720
