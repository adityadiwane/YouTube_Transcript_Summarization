00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
Hopefully it won't stutter.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
but you seem to have more hair.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
but I was getting younger than everybody else?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
I was born with some form of disease.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Voice: What kind of disease?

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
BP: I was born old.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
Man: I'm sorry.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Girl: Are you sick?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and they said I was gonna die soon.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
But ... maybe not.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
BB: There were many changes ...

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
some you could see, some you couldn't.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Hair started growing in all sorts of places,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
along with other things.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
I felt pretty good, considering.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
but what you might not know

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
is that for nearly the first hour of the film,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
is completely computer-generated from the neck up.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
We've created a completely digital human head.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
for well over half a century,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
with Ron Howard as the director.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
It was deemed impossible.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.330
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
The human form, in particular the human head,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
The project came back to us about a decade later,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
and this time with a director named David Fincher.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
David is fearless of technology,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
and he is absolutely tenacious.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And David won't take "no."

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
that anything is possible

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
And so David had an interesting take on the film,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
and he threw a challenge at us.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
He wanted the main character of the film to be played

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
from the cradle to the grave by one actor.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
It happened to be this guy.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
That was one idea: that we would have different actors,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
and we would hand off from actor to actor.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
particularly in close-up.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
to bring the aging to this character.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
So we decided to cast a series of little people

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
that would play the different bodies of Benjamin

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
at the different increments of his life

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
aged to appear as Benjamin,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
and attach that to the body of the real actor.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
Sounded great.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
you know -- we see his face constantly.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
but it was a very high-risk proposition.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
that might work ...

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
But despite our verbal assurances,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
they wanted some proof.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
And we did it in about five weeks.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
After many years of starts and stops on this project,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
and making that tough decision,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
they finally decided to greenlight the movie.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
to say the movie was a go,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
I actually threw up.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
(Laughter)

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
You know, this is some tough stuff.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
So we started to have early team meetings,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
and we got everybody together,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
So we had a big problem:

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
we didn't know how we were going to do this.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
But we did know one thing.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Being from the visual effects industry,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.330
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
So, when you're faced with something like that,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
of course you've got to break it down.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.330
and you start to attack that.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
We needed to make Brad look a lot older --

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
needed to age him 45 years or so.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.330
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
and have that translate through our process

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
And we also needed to create a character

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
that could hold up under, really, all conditions.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
at nighttime, under candlelight,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
he had to hold an extreme close-up,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.330
he had to deliver dialogue,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.330
he even had to throw up.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Not all at the same time --

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
but he had to, you know, do all of those things.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
We did about 325 shots.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
to do everything a human being can do.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
And we realized that there was a giant chasm

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
between the state of the art of technology in 2004

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
and where we needed it to be.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
So we focused on motion capture.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
The state of the art at the time

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
was something called marker-based motion capture.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.330
I'll give you an example here.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
and they put some reflective markers on your body,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
and instead of using cameras,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
there're infrared sensors around a volume,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
of those markers in real time.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
and apply them to a computer-generated character.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
You can see the computer characters on the right

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
are having the same complex motion as the dancers.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
that were using facial marker tracking,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.330
and doing the same process.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.330
And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
That's not terribly compelling.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
And what we realized

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.330
was that what we needed

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
was the information that was going on between the markers.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
We needed the subtleties of the skin.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
So we aborted using motion capture.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And we were now well out of our comfort zone,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
and in uncharted territory.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
So we were left with this idea

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
that we ended up calling "technology stew."

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
We started to look out in other fields.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
The idea was that we were going to find

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
nuggets or gems of technology

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
that come from other industries like medical imaging,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.330
the video game space,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
and re-appropriate them.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
And we had to create kind of a sauce.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
And the sauce was code in software

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
to come together and work as one.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
Initially, we came across some remarkable research

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
He believed that he could, in fact,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
catalog the human face.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
He believed that there were 70 basic poses

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
or shapes of the human face,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
and that those basic poses or shapes of the face

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
can be combined to create infinite possibilities

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
of everything the human face is capable of doing.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
And then we came across some remarkable technology

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.330
called Contour.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
stippled on her face.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
as opposed to a marker capture.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.330
So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And if you look in a comparison,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
and on the right you see what markers give us.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
But these were the early days of this technology,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
and it wasn't really proven yet.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
We measure complexity and fidelity of data

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
in terms of polygonal count.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
We could go up into the millions of polygons.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
It seemed to be infinite.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
This was when we had our "Aha!"

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.330
This was the breakthrough.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.330
This is actually going to work."

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
and we could put Brad in this device,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
and use this Contour process,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.330
and put him under the black lights,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and we could, in fact, scan him in real time

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
performing Ekman's FACS poses.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Right? So, effectively,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
we ended up with a 3D database

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
(Laughter)

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
From there, we actually carved up those faces

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
into smaller pieces and components of his face.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
a complete database of all possibilities

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
that his face is capable of doing.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
We brought in Rick Baker,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.330
of our industry.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
And we commissioned them to make a maquette,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
or a bust, of Benjamin.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
I had to unveil something.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
So this is Ben 80.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
We created three of these:

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And this really became the template for moving forward.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
at very high resolution --

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
enormous polygonal count.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
in the computer.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
We went through this process, then, called retargeting.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
And here's the resulting data that comes from that,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
the model that comes from that.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
onto another model.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
was made from Brad,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
we could transpose the data of Brad at 44

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
onto Brad at 87.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
Next we had to go into the shooting process.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.330
So while all that's going on,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
And we shot our body actors,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
and we shot them wearing blue hoods.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And the blue hoods helped us with two things:

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
one, we could easily erase their heads;

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
and we also put tracking markers on their heads

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
so we could recreate the camera motion

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
and the lens optics from the set.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
with the rest of the cast and the body actors

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
and about six months later

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and he watched on the screen.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
His job, then, was to become Benjamin.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.330
And so we looped the scenes.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.330
He watched again and again.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
We encouraged him to improvise.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
that we didn't think he was going to go.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
We shot him with four HD cameras

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.330
so we'd get multiple views of him

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
that he thought best matched the footage

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.330
with the rest of the cast.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
From there we went into a process called image analysis.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
And so, what's interesting about this is

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
we used something called image analysis,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
And the software would tell us that, well,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
and it concludes moving in frame 32.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
to pull that data from.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew --

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
match the performance footage of Brad

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.330
in live action with our database of aged Benjamin,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
the FACS shapes that we had.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
On a frame-by-frame basis,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
we could actually reconstruct a 3D head

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
that exactly matched the performance of Brad.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
And here you can see the body actor.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And then here's the reconstructed performance

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.330
now with the timings of the performance.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
And then, again, the final shot.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
It was a long process.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
(Applause)

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.330
because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
We had to create a lighting system.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
for every single location that Benjamin had to appear

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
so that we could put Ben's head into any scene

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.330
in the real world.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
We also had to create an eye system.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
We found the old adage, you know,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
"The eyes are the window to the soul,"

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.330
absolutely true.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
and feel his intent coming through the eyes,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.330
then we would succeed.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
So we had one person focused on the eye system

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
for almost two full years.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
We also had to create a mouth system.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
We worked from dental molds of Brad.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
We had to age the teeth over time.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
He was very popular.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
Skin displacement: another big deal.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
around other old people,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
so he had to look exactly the same as the others.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.330
So, lots of work on skin deformation,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.330
you can see in some of these cases it works,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.330
in some cases it looks bad.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
This is a very, very, very early test in our process.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.330
So, effectively we created a digital puppet

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.330
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
or enhance his performance.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
There was something that we encountered, though,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.330
that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
So, as things went through this process,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
is they couldn't understand intent,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
the intent of the actor.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
So it sees a smile as a smile.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.330
or a frustrated smile.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
But we ended up calling the entire process

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and all the technology "emotion capture,"

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.330
as opposed to just motion capture.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.330
Take another look.
