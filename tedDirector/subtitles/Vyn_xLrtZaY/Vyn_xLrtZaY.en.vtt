00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:16.014
An evolutionary biologist
at Purdue University

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:19.160
named William Muir studied chickens.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.249
He was interested in productivity --

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.539
I think it's something
that concerns all of us --

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.827
but it's easy to measure in chickens
because you just count the eggs.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.527
(Laughter)

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.944
He wanted to know what could make
his chickens more productive,

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:34.870
so he devised a beautiful experiment.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.328
Chickens live in groups, so first of all,
he selected just an average flock,

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:42.718
and he let it alone for six generations.

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:44.807
But then he created a second group

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:47.315
of the individually
most productive chickens --

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.270
you could call them superchickens --

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.377
and he put them together in a superflock,

00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:57.075
and each generation, he selected
only the most productive for breeding.

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.969
After six generations had passed,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.717
what did he find?

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:05.548
Well, the first group, the average group,
was doing just fine.

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.074
They were all plump and fully feathered

00:01:08.074 --> 00:01:10.352
and egg production
had increased dramatically.

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:12.559
What about the second group?

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:15.293
Well, all but three were dead.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.413
They'd pecked the rest to death.

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:19.990
(Laughter)

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.501
The individually productive chickens
had only achieved their success

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:30.164
by suppressing the productivity
of the rest.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.525
Now, as I've gone around the world
talking about this and telling this story

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.777
in all sorts of organizations
and companies,

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:39.353
people have seen
the relevance almost instantly,

00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:41.659
and they come up and they say
things to me like,

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.750
"That superflock, that's my company."

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.715
(Laughter)

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:50.226
Or, "That's my country."

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.318
Or, "That's my life."

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:56.722
All my life I've been told that the way
we have to get ahead is to compete:

00:01:56.722 --> 00:02:00.754
get into the right school,
get into the right job, get to the top,

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.492
and I've really never found it
very inspiring.

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:09.275
I've started and run businesses
because invention is a joy,

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:12.595
and because working alongside
brilliant, creative people

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:14.075
is its own reward.

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:20.397
And I've never really felt very motivated
by pecking orders or by superchickens

00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:22.966
or by superstars.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.220
But for the past 50 years,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.452
we've run most organizations
and some societies

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:31.770
along the superchicken model.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.582
We've thought that success is achieved
by picking the superstars,

00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:39.731
the brightest men,
or occasionally women, in the room,

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:43.090
and giving them all the resources
and all the power.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.493
And the result has been just the same
as in William Muir's experiment:

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:52.462
aggression, dysfunction and waste.

00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:56.572
If the only way the most productive
can be successful

00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:59.753
is by suppressing
the productivity of the rest,

00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:03.236
then we badly need to find
a better way to work

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:06.010
and a richer way to live.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.921
(Applause)

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:14.915
So what is it that makes some groups

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:18.390
obviously more successful
and more productive than others?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.974
Well, that's the question
a team at MIT took to research.

00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:24.400
They brought in hundreds of volunteers,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.894
they put them into groups, and they
gave them very hard problems to solve.

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:30.625
And what happened was exactly
what you'd expect,

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:33.931
that some groups were very much
more successful than others,

00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:37.461
but what was really interesting
was that the high-achieving groups

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.108
were not those where they had
one or two people

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:43.149
with spectacularly high I.Q.

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.748
Nor were the most successful groups
the ones that had the highest

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:49.117
aggregate I.Q.

00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:54.991
Instead, they had three characteristics,
the really successful teams.

00:03:54.991 --> 00:04:00.633
First of all, they showed high degrees
of social sensitivity to each other.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.232
This is measured by something called
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.

00:04:04.232 --> 00:04:06.717
It's broadly considered
a test for empathy,

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.914
and the groups that scored highly on this

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.864
did better.

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:15.972
Secondly, the successful groups
gave roughly equal time to each other,

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:18.317
so that no one voice dominated,

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:21.103
but neither were there any passengers.

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:23.820
And thirdly, the more successful groups

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.165
had more women in them.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.162
(Applause)

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:32.437
Now, was this because women
typically score more highly on

00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:34.310
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.037
so you're getting a doubling down
on the empathy quotient?

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.795
Or was it because they brought
a more diverse perspective?

00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:43.951
We don't really know, but the striking
thing about this experiment

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.380
is that it showed what we know, which is
some groups do better than others,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.731
but what's key to that

00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:54.378
is their social connectedness
to each other.

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:58.375
So how does this play out
in the real world?

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:03.716
Well, it means that what happens
between people really counts,

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:07.524
because in groups that are highly
attuned and sensitive to each other,

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:10.780
ideas can flow and grow.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.768
People don't get stuck.
They don't waste energy down dead ends.

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:19.482
An example: Arup is one of the world's
most successful engineering firms,

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:22.134
and it was commissioned to build
the equestrian center

00:05:22.134 --> 00:05:24.000
for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.826
Now, this building had to receive

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:31.120
two and a half thousand
really highly strung thoroughbred horses

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.209
that were coming off long-haul flights,

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:36.692
highly jet-lagged,
not feeling their finest.

00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:40.104
And the problem
the engineer confronted was,

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:43.780
what quantity of waste to cater for?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.184
Now, you don't get taught this
in engineering school -- (Laughter) --

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:52.388
and it's not really the kind of thing
you want to get wrong,

00:05:52.388 --> 00:05:55.853
so he could have spent months
talking to vets, doing the research,

00:05:55.853 --> 00:05:57.654
tweaking the spreadsheet.

00:05:57.654 --> 00:06:00.799
Instead, he asked for help

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:05.285
and he found someone who had designed
the Jockey Club in New York.

00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:09.404
The problem was solved in less than a day.

00:06:09.404 --> 00:06:12.191
Arup believes that
the culture of helpfulness

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.959
is central to their success.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.400
Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.498
but it's absolutely core
to successful teams,

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:28.707
and it routinely outperforms
individual intelligence.

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:32.322
Helpfulness means I don't
have to know everything,

00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:37.600
I just have to work among people
who are good at getting and giving help.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.361
At SAP, they reckon that you can answer
any question in 17 minutes.

00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:47.126
But there isn't a single
high-tech company I've worked with

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:52.571
that imagines for a moment
that this is a technology issue,

00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:57.041
because what drives helpfulness
is people getting to know each other.

00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:02.782
Now that sounds so obvious, and we think
it'll just happen normally,

00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:04.410
but it doesn't.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.704
When I was running
my first software company,

00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:09.738
I realized that we were getting stuck.

00:07:09.738 --> 00:07:13.523
There was a lot of friction,
but not much else,

00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:18.399
and I gradually realized the brilliant,
creative people that I'd hired

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:20.364
didn't know each other.

00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:24.241
They were so focused
on their own individual work,

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:27.970
they didn't even know
who they were sitting next to,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.541
and it was only when I insisted
that we stop working

00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:33.125
and invest time in getting
to know each other

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:36.223
that we achieved real momentum.

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:39.409
Now, that was 20 years ago,
and now I visit companies

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:42.311
that have banned coffee cups at desks

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.305
because they want people to hang out
around the coffee machines

00:07:46.305 --> 00:07:48.139
and talk to each other.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.647
The Swedes even have
a special term for this.

00:07:50.647 --> 00:07:54.007
They call it fika, which means
more than a coffee break.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:57.613
It means collective restoration.

00:07:57.613 --> 00:08:00.724
At Idexx, a company up in Maine,

00:08:00.724 --> 00:08:03.516
they've created vegetable gardens
on campus so that people

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.768
from different parts of the business

00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:10.644
can work together and get to know
the whole business that way.

00:08:10.644 --> 00:08:12.989
Have they all gone mad?

00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:16.542
Quite the opposite -- they've figured out
that when the going gets tough,

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:18.585
and it always will get tough

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:21.301
if you're doing breakthrough work
that really matters,

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.972
what people need is social support,

00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:27.199
and they need to know who to ask for help.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:31.936
Companies don't have ideas;
only people do.

00:08:31.936 --> 00:08:34.536
And what motivates people

00:08:34.536 --> 00:08:39.030
are the bonds and loyalty and trust
they develop between each other.

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:43.260
What matters is the mortar,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.549
not just the bricks.

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:48.273
Now, when you put all of this together,

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:51.431
what you get is something
called social capital.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:56.980
Social capital is the reliance
and interdependency that builds trust.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.471
The term comes from sociologists
who were studying communities

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:04.739
that proved particularly resilient
in times of stress.

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:09.960
Social capital is what
gives companies momentum,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.222
and social capital
is what makes companies robust.

00:09:16.182 --> 00:09:18.442
What does this mean in practical terms?

00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:22.759
It means that time is everything,

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:27.426
because social capital
compounds with time.

00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:32.534
So teams that work together longer
get better, because it takes time

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:38.041
to develop the trust you need
for real candor and openness.

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.925
And time is what builds value.

00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:44.878
When Alex Pentland
suggested to one company

00:09:44.878 --> 00:09:47.594
that they synchronize coffee breaks

00:09:47.594 --> 00:09:51.495
so that people would have time
to talk to each other,

00:09:51.495 --> 00:09:54.978
profits went up 15 million dollars,

00:09:54.978 --> 00:09:58.832
and employee satisfaction
went up 10 percent.

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:01.933
Not a bad return on social capital,

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:05.960
which compounds even as you spend it.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.022
Now, this isn't about chumminess,
and it's no charter for slackers,

00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:16.656
because people who work this way
tend to be kind of scratchy,

00:10:16.656 --> 00:10:20.690
impatient, absolutely determined
to think for themselves

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.680
because that's what their contribution is.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.979
Conflict is frequent
because candor is safe.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.471
And that's how good ideas
turn into great ideas,

00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:38.571
because no idea is born fully formed.

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:41.900
It emerges a little bit
as a child is born,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.489
kind of messy and confused,
but full of possibilities.

00:10:46.489 --> 00:10:52.610
And it's only through the generous
contribution, faith and challenge

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.892
that they achieve their potential.

00:10:55.892 --> 00:10:59.955
And that's what social capital supports.

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:04.228
Now, we aren't really used
to talking about this,

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:08.198
about talent, about creativity,
in this way.

00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:11.932
We're used to talking about stars.

00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:16.371
So I started to wonder,
well, if we start working this way,

00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:18.595
does that mean no more stars?

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.805
So I went and I sat in on the auditions

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:25.661
at the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art in London.

00:11:25.661 --> 00:11:28.886
And what I saw there really surprised me,

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:33.786
because the teachers weren't looking
for individual pyrotechnics.

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:38.476
They were looking for what happened
between the students,

00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:42.586
because that's where the drama is.

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:44.875
And when I talked
to producers of hit albums,

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:48.103
they said, "Oh sure, we have
lots of superstars in music.

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:51.220
It's just, they don't last very long.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.220
It's the outstanding collaborators
who enjoy the long careers,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.432
because bringing out the best in others
is how they found the best

00:11:59.432 --> 00:12:01.076
in themselves."

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:04.115
And when I went to visit companies
that are renowned

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:06.182
for their ingenuity and creativity,

00:12:06.182 --> 00:12:09.107
I couldn't even see any superstars,

00:12:09.107 --> 00:12:13.445
because everybody there really mattered.

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:16.328
And when I reflected on my own career,

00:12:16.328 --> 00:12:20.252
and the extraordinary people
I've had the privilege to work with,

00:12:20.252 --> 00:12:25.796
I realized how much more
we could give each other

00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:30.917
if we just stopped trying
to be superchickens.

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:36.970
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:43.346
Once you appreciate
truly how social work is,

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.443
a lot of things have to change.

00:12:46.443 --> 00:12:50.530
Management by talent contest
has routinely pitted

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.991
employees against each other.

00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:57.505
Now, rivalry has to be replaced
by social capital.

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:01.480
For decades, we've tried
to motivate people with money,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.360
even though we've got
a vast amount of research that shows

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.191
that money erodes social connectedness.

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:14.186
Now, we need to let people
motivate each other.

00:13:14.646 --> 00:13:19.570
And for years, we've thought that leaders
were heroic soloists who were expected,

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.726
all by themselves,
to solve complex problems.

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:26.278
Now, we need to redefine leadership

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:30.342
as an activity in which
conditions are created

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:36.300
in which everyone can do their most
courageous thinking together.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.820
We know that this works.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.505
When the Montreal Protocol called
for the phasing out of CFCs,

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:48.847
the chlorofluorocarbons implicated
in the hole in the ozone layer,

00:13:48.847 --> 00:13:51.032
the risks were immense.

00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:54.231
CFCs were everywhere,

00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:56.780
and nobody knew if a substitute
could be found.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.671
But one team that rose to the challenge
adopted three key principles.

00:14:03.289 --> 00:14:06.647
The first was the head of engineering,
Frank Maslen, said,

00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:09.980
there will be no stars in this team.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.257
We need everybody.

00:14:12.257 --> 00:14:14.985
Everybody has a valid perspective.

00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:19.711
Second, we work to one standard only:

00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:22.310
the best imaginable.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.632
And third, he told his boss,
Geoff Tudhope,

00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.605
that he had to butt out,

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:30.856
because he knew
how disruptive power can be.

00:14:30.856 --> 00:14:33.689
Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.

00:14:33.689 --> 00:14:35.430
He gave the team air cover,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.540
and he listened to ensure
that they honored their principles.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:46.260
And it worked: Ahead of all the other
companies tackling this hard problem,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.518
this group cracked it first.

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.339
And to date, the Montreal Protocol

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:58.060
is the most successful international
environmental agreement

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.982
ever implemented.

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:03.940
There was a lot at stake then,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.679
and there's a lot at stake now,

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:11.207
and we won't solve our problems
if we expect it to be solved

00:15:11.207 --> 00:15:13.808
by a few supermen or superwomen.

00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:17.314
Now we need everybody,

00:15:17.314 --> 00:15:23.540
because it is only when we accept
that everybody has value

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:30.586
that we will liberate the energy
and imagination and momentum we need

00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:35.360
to create the best beyond measure.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.100
Thank you.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.100
(Applause)
