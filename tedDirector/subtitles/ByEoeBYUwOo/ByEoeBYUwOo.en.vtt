00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.040
I am holding something remarkably old.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.416
It is older than any human artifact,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.736
older than life on Earth,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.840
older than the continents
and the oceans between them.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.616
This was formed
over four billion years ago

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.776
in the earliest days of the solar system

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.600
while the planets were still forming.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.496
This rusty lump of nickel and iron
may not appear special,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.960
but when it is cut open ...

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.000
you can see that it is different
from earthly metals.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.336
This pattern reveals metallic crystals
that can only form out in space

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.936
where molten metal
can cool extremely slowly,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.280
a few degrees every million years.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.256
This was once part
of a much larger object,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.856
one of millions left over
after the planets formed.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
We call these objects asteroids.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.936
Asteroids are our oldest
and most numerous cosmic neighbors.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.016
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids
orbiting around the Sun,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.296
shown in yellow,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.256
and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.496
shown in blue.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.856
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids
have been greatly exaggerated

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.256
so you can see them clearly.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.656
Teams of scientists across the globe
are searching for these objects,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.616
discovering new ones every day,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.760
steadily mapping near-Earth space.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.240
Much of this work is funded by NASA.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.536
I think of the search for these asteroids
as a giant public works project,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.816
but instead of building a highway,
we're charting outer space,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.816
building an archive
that will last for generations.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.760
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids
discovered just last year.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.336
And these are all of the known
near-Earth asteroids,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.376
which at last count was 13,733.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.536
Each one has been imaged, cataloged

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.936
and had its path
around the Sun determined.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.056
Although it varies
from asteroid to asteroid,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.336
the paths of most asteroids
can be predicted for dozens of years.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.136
And the paths of some asteroids can be
predicted with incredible precision.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.816
For example, scientists
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.856
predicted where the asteroid Toutatis
was going to be four years in advance

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.976
to within 30 kilometers.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.296
In those four years,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.136
Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.735
That's a fractional precision

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:31.560
of 0.000000004.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.840
(Laughter)

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.136
Now, the reason I have
this beautiful asteroid fragment

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.696
is because, like all neighbors,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.920
asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.120
(Laughter)

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.136
Three years ago today,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.816
a small asteroid exploded
over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.136
That object was about 19 meters across,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.080
or about as big as a convenience store.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.920
Objects of this size hit the Earth
every 50 years or so.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.576
66 million years ago,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.536
a much larger object hit the Earth,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.336
causing a massive extinction.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.576
75 percent of plant
and animal species were lost,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
including, sadly, the dinosaurs.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.016
That object was
about 10 kilometers across,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.216
and 10 kilometers is roughly
the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.136
So the next time you're in an airplane,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.976
snag a window seat, look out
and imagine a rock so enormous

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.096
that resting on the ground,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.000
it just grazes your wingtip.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.157
It's so wide that it takes your plane
one full minute to fly past it.

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.678
That's the size of the asteroid
that hit the Earth.

00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:38.294
It has only been within my lifetime

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.534
that asteroids have been considered
a credible threat to our planet.

00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:44.134
And since then, there's been
a focused effort underway

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.998
to discover and catalog these objects.

00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:49.334
I am lucky enough
to be part of this effort.

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:53.014
I'm part of a team of scientists
that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:55.734
Now, NEOWISE was not
designed to find asteroids.

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:59.974
It was designed to orbit the earth
and look far beyond our solar system

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:03.414
to seek out the coldest stars
and the most luminous galaxies.

00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:06.878
And it did that very well
for its designed lifetime of seven months.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.774
But today, six years later,
it's still going.

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.534
We've repurposed it
to discover and study asteroids.

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:15.894
And although it's
a wonderful little space robot,

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:17.998
these days it's kind of like a used car.

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:21.774
The cryogen that used to refrigerate
its sensors is long gone,

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:23.998
so we joke that
its air-conditioning is broken.

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:28.894
It's got 920 million miles
on the odometer,

00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:30.174
but it still runs great

00:04:30.198 --> 00:04:33.774
and reliably takes a photograph
of the sky every 11 seconds.

00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:36.638
It's taken 23 photos
since I began speaking to you.

00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:40.294
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable

00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:42.934
is that it sees the sky
in the thermal infrared.

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.294
That means that instead of seeing
the sunlight that asteroids reflect,

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:48.134
NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.

00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:51.894
This is a vital capability
since some asteroids are as dark as coal

00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:55.374
and can be difficult or impossible
to spot with other telescopes.

00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:58.478
But all asteroids, light or dark,
shine brightly for NEOWISE.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.734
Astronomers are using
every technique at their disposal

00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:06.054
to discover and study asteroids.

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.934
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.014
The community, together, discovered
over 90 percent of asteroids

00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:14.894
bigger than one kilometer across --

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:17.894
objects capable
of massive destruction to Earth.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.494
But the job's not done yet.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:24.454
An object 140 meters or bigger
could decimate a medium-sized country.

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:27.678
So far, we've only found
25 percent of those.

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:31.654
We must keep searching the sky
for near-Earth asteroids.

00:05:31.678 --> 00:05:34.414
We are the only species
able to understand calculus

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:36.094
or build telescopes.

00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:38.094
We know how to find these objects.

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:40.254
This is our responsibility.

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:44.054
If we found a hazardous asteroid
with significant early warning,

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.774
we could nudge it out of the way.

00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:48.854
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes
or volcanic eruptions,

00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:51.774
an asteroid impact
can be precisely predicted

00:05:51.798 --> 00:05:53.254
and prevented.

00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:56.414
What we need to do now
is map near-Earth space.

00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:58.294
We must keep searching the sky.

00:05:58.318 --> 00:05:59.534
Thank you.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:05.129
(Applause)
