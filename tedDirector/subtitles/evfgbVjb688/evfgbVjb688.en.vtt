00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
If you really want to understand

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
the problem that we're facing with the oceans,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
you have to think about the biology

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
at the same time you think about the physics.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
We can't solve the problems

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
unless we start studying the ocean

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in a very much more interdisciplinary way.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
So I'm going to demonstrate that through

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
We'll look at sea level rise.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
We'll look at ocean warming.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
What frightens you?"

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
for me, it's ocean acidification.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
So I will spend a little time at the end.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I was in Copenhagen in December

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
like a number of you in this room.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And I think we all found it, simultaneously,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
an eye-opening

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and a very frustrating experience.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I sat in this large negotiation hall,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
at one point, for three or four hours,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.260
without hearing the word "oceans" one time.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
It really wasn't on the radar screen.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
The nations that brought it up

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
when we had the speeches of the national leaders --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
it tended to be the leaders of the small island states,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the low-lying island states.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And by this weird quirk

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
of alphabetical order of the nations,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
a lot of the low-lying states,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
like Kiribati and Nauru,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
You know, they were marginalized

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in the negotiation room.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
One of the problems

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
is coming up with the right target.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
It's not clear what the target should be.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And how can you figure out how to fix something

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
if you don't have a clear target?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now, you've heard about "two degrees":

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
But there's not a lot of science behind that number.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We've also talked about

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Should it be 450? Should it be 400?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
There's not a lot of science behind that one either.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Most of the science that is behind these numbers,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
these potential targets,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is based on studies on land.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and think about what the targets should be,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
we would argue that they must be much lower.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
You know, from an oceanic perspective,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
450 is way too high.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Now there's compelling evidence

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that it really needs to be 350.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
We are, right now, at 390 parts per million

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and the discussion as we go forward

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
has to focus on how far the overshoot goes

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and what's the pathway back to 350.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Now, why is this so complicated?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Well, the problem is that

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
we've got very complicated forces in the climate system.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
There's air-sea interactions.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Here in Galapagos,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
That changes our climate.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So anything that influences

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
changes the ocean of the planet.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And we know the solar output's not constant through time.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So those are all natural causes of climate change.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And then we have the human-induced causes

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
of climate change as well.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
the reflectivity.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
it's methane, ozone,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Is CO2 produced by man's activities

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
causing the planet to warm up?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
But to answer that question,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
you have to know something about

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
all of these other agents of change.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
You know, thousands of scientists

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
have been working on understanding

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
all of these man-made causes

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and the natural causes.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And we've got it worked out, and we can say,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
I'll show you a few examples of this now.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
It's a scientific drilling vessel.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
to recover sediments

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that tell us stories of climate change, right.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
is to drill down in time

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
to the last period

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
where we had CO2 double what it is today.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And so that's what we've done with this ship.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
It looks downright tropical there.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
One day where we had calm seas and sun,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
which was the reason I could get off the ship.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Most of the time it looked like this.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
We had a waves up to 50 ft.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and winds averaging

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
about 40 knots for most of the voyage

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and up to 70 or 80 knots.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
So that trip just ended,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and I can't show you too many results from that right now,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
but we'll go back one more year,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to another drilling expedition I've been involved in.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It's the ANDRILL project.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And we made the very first bore hole

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to keep everybody warm,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
drilling at temperatures of minus 40.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And we drilled in the Ross Sea.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So, this huge floating ice shelf

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
the size of Alaska

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
comes from West Antarctica.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
where the ice is grounded on sea floor

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
as much as 2,000 meters deep.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So that ice sheet is partly floating,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
is sea level rises a little bit,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and exactly how fast that ice can melt.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Here's the cartoon on the left there.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
then through 900 meters of water

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It took about 10 years to put this project together.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And here's what we found.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and people are doing all kinds of really complicated

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and expensive analyses.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
was this simple visual description.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
We saw these alternations

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
between sediments that look like this --

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
there's gravel and cobbles in there

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and a bunch of sand.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
That's the kind of material in the deep sea.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
This sediment is 100 percent made up

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
of the shells of microscopic plants.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And these plants need sunlight,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
so we know when we find that sediment

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
there's no ice overhead.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And we saw about 35 alternations

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
between open water and ice-covered water,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
between gravels and these plant sediments.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
So what that means is, what it tells us

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
melted back and formed anew

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
about 35 times.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And this is in the past four million years.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
This was completely unexpected.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
was this dynamic.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
In fact, the lore for many years has been,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and it's been there ever since."

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And now we know that in our recent past

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
it melted back and formed again,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
What caused it?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But here's the key thing:

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
you know, the other thing we found out

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
is that the ice sheet passed a threshold,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
that the planet warmed up enough --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
the planet warmed up enough that it became ...

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
that ice sheet became very dynamic

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and was very easily melted.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And you know what?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
just the right amount.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So many of us are convinced now

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
We do expect to see a sea-level rise

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And it could be larger than that.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
This is a serious consequence

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
for nations like Kiribati,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
you know, where the average elevation

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
is about a little over a meter above sea level.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
This is a bleached coral,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
This is from Champion Island.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
When these things die,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
immediately, organisms come in

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and encrust and live on that dead surface.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
And so, when a coral colony is killed

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
by an El Nino event,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
it leaves this indelible record.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
You can go then and study corals

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and figure out how often do you see this.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
So one of the things thought of in the '80s

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
was to go back and take cores

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
of coral heads throughout the Galapagos

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and find out how often was there a devastating event.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And just so you know, 1982-'83,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
that El Nino killed 95 percent

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
of all the corals here in Galapagos.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And what we found

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
after drilling back in time two to 400 years

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
was that these were unique events.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
We saw no other mass mortality events.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
So these events in our recent past really are unique.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
or they're just very strong El Ninos

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Either case, it's bad news

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
for the corals of the Galapagos Islands.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Here's how we sample the corals.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
This coral is eight meters tall, right.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And it been growing for about 600 years.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
And we started working on it,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
from analyzing a coral like this.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
So we have a diamond drill.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
That the place where,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
during an earthquake in 1954,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
this marine terrace was lifted up

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
out of the ocean very quickly,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and this is the grandaddy coral.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
It's 11 meters in diameter,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and we know that it started growing

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
in the year 1584.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Imagine that.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
until 1954, when the earthquake happened.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Now the reason we know it's 1584

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
is that these corals have growth bands.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
you see these light and dark bands.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Each one of those is a year.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And we just count on down to the bottom.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Then their other attribute is

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that they have this great chemistry.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
We can analyze the carbonate

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that makes up the coral,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Their ratio tells us the water temperature.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
In this example here,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
we had monitored this reef in Galapagos

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
with temperature recorders,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and now you can see, those curves match perfectly.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
In this case, at these islands,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
you know, corals

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And of course, our thermometers

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
only take us back 50 years or so here.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
The coral can take us back

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
hundreds and thousands of years.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
So, what we do:

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
we've merged a lot of different data sets.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
of temperature change that go back hundreds of years,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and we put them together.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Here's a synthetic diagram.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
There's a whole family of curves here.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
of temperature on the planet.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And there's five or six different compilations there,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
But each one of those compilations reflects input

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
We do similar things with ice cores.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
We work with tree rings.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And that's how we discover

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
what is truly natural

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
and how different is the last century, right?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And I chose this one

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
because it's complicated and messy looking, right.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
This is as messy as it gets.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
You can see there's some signals there.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Some of the records

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
show lower temperatures than others.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Some of them show greater variability.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
But they all tell us

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
what the natural variability is.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere;

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
some are from the entire globe.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
But here's what we can say:

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
It was cooling down

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
until about 1900 or so.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And there is natural variability

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and we know the magnitude;

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
But then at the very end is where

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
we have the instrumental record in black.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
You know, we've warmed the globe

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
about a degree Centigrade in the last century,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and there's nothing

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
in the natural part of that record

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
that resembles what we've seen in the last century.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
You know, that's the strength of our argument,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
that we are doing something that's truly different.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So I'll close with a short discussion

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
of ocean acidification.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
I like it as a component of global change to talk about,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and I talk to that community fairly often,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
you cannot deny

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
the simple physics

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
of CO2 dissolving in the ocean.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
from fossil fuels, from cement production.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
is dissolving straight into the sea, right?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And as it does so,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
it makes the ocean more acidic.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So, you cannot argue with that.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
That is what's happening right now,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
and it's a very different issue

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
than the global warming issue.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
It has many consequences.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
There's consequences for carbonate organisms.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
There are many organisms

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
that build their shells out of calcium carbonate --

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
plants and animals both.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
The main framework material of coral reefs

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
is calcium carbonate.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
That material is more soluble

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
in acidic fluid.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
So one of the things we're seeing

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
is organisms are having

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
to spend more metabolic energy

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
to build and maintain their shells.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
At some point, as this transience,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
that material's actually going to start to dissolve.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
And on coral reefs,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
where some of the main framework organisms disappear,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
we will see a major loss

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
of marine biodiversity.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
There's many physiological processes

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
So, all of these things --

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
greater metabolic demands,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
reduced reproductive success,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
changes in respiration and metabolism.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to expect to see stressed

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
caused by this transience.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
So we figured out some pretty interesting ways

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
going back millions of years.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
We used to do it just with ice cores,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
but in this case, we're going back 20 million years.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
And we take samples of the sediment,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
And here's the thing:

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
you have to go back about 15 million years

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
to find a time when CO2 levels

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
were about what they are today.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
You have to go back about 30 million years

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
to find a time when CO2 levels

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
were double what they are today.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Now, what that means is

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
that all of the organisms that live in the sea

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
have evolved in this chemostatted ocean,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
with CO2 levels lower than they are today.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
to this rapid acidification

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
that's going on right now.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
So, Charlie Veron

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
came up with this statement last year:

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
"The prospect of ocean acidification

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
may well be the most serious

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
of all of the predicted outcomes

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
of anthropogenic CO2 release."

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
And I think that may very well be true,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
so I'll close with this.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.260
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
but for the sake of the oceans,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
as soon as possible.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
(Applause)
