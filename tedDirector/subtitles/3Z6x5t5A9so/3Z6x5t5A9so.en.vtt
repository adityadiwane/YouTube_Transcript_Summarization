00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:21.482
One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.674
to go find a man I'd never met

00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:25.810
but who had changed my life.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.555
I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.056
I didn't have an exact address,

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:33.671
but I knew his name, Abed,

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:38.323
I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,

00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:43.134
and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:45.355
he broke my neck.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.619
And so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.325
off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.197
The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.

00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:59.837
I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,

00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:02.163
heavy with four tons of floor tiles,

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:04.981
had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.119
of the minibus where I sat.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.773
I was then 19 years old.

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:14.100
I'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.044
in eight months, and the night before the crash,

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.210
I delighted in my new body,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.351
playing basketball with friends

00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:23.457
into the wee hours of a May morning.

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.152
I palmed the ball in my large right hand,

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.497
and when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.

00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:34.343
I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:36.891
I didn't see Abed coming.

00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:39.263
From my seat, I was looking up at a stone town

00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:42.249
on a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.725
when from behind there was a great bang,

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:47.642
as loud and violent as a bomb.

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:50.118
My head snapped back over my red seat.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.204
My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.458
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,

00:01:56.458 --> 00:02:00.674
and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:03.095
Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.100
then to sit and to stand and to walk,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.568
but my body was now divided vertically.

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:12.029
I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:16.664
I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:20.142
College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.

00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:23.020
There I rose from my chair for good,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.979
I leaned on my cane, and I looked back,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.960
finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.751
to photographs of the crash,

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.762
and when I saw this photograph,

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:39.569
I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.316
I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.632
and I mourned that it was lost,

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.018
mourned all I had not yet done,

00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:51.910
but was now impossible.

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:58.274
It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave

00:02:58.274 --> 00:03:00.490
the morning after the crash,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.372
of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:07.327
Reading his words, I welled with anger.

00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:10.827
It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,

00:03:10.827 --> 00:03:13.650
and it came from magical thinking.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.773
On this xeroxed piece of paper,

00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:19.326
the crash had not yet happened.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.415
Abed could still turn his wheel left

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:24.799
so that I would see him whoosh by out my window

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.241
and I would remain whole.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:31.099
"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.412
But Abed did not slow,

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:37.220
and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.223
and again, I was left without anger.

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:43.623
I decided to find Abed,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.363
and when I finally did,

00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:48.916
he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.091
it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.465
And maybe he had.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.638
I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record --

00:03:56.638 --> 00:04:00.419
27 violations by the age of 25,

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.110
the last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day —

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.203
and I didn't mention my prior record --

00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:08.911
the quadriplegia and the catheters,

00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:11.432
the insecurity and the loss —

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:14.124
and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:16.484
I didn't say that I knew from the police report

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:19.187
that he'd escaped serious injury.

00:04:19.187 --> 00:04:22.920
I said I wanted to meet.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.563
Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks,

00:04:25.563 --> 00:04:28.139
and when I did, and a recording told me

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.412
that his number was disconnected,

00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:35.388
I let Abed and the crash go.

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.618
Many years passed.

00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:41.887
I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:44.557
on trips in six continents.

00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:47.996
I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.224
that I started in Central Park,

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:53.137
and home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,

00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:57.223
typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.

00:04:57.223 --> 00:04:59.730
A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.622
mirrored my own, each centering on a life

00:05:02.622 --> 00:05:04.982
that had changed in an instant,

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:07.803
owing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.436
a swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:14.410
Each of us had a before and an after.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.513
I'd been working through my lot after all.

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:21.686
Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:24.476
I returned to Israel to write of the crash,

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:27.108
and the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,"

00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:30.056
was nearly complete when I recognized

00:05:30.056 --> 00:05:32.493
that I still wanted to meet Abed,

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:35.400
and finally I understood why:

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.729
to hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry."

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.647
People apologize for less.

00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:46.459
And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.676
somewhere in his same town,

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:51.748
and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,

00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:55.741
when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:59.123
But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?

00:05:59.123 --> 00:06:03.205
(Laughter)

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:05.351
I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,

00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:07.410
and bought a brick of Turkish delight:

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.599
pistachios glued in rosewater. Better.

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.012
Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.

00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:19.194
Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.

00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:23.391
Abed would say, "I'm sorry."

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.417
I then began to wonder, as I had many times before,

00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:27.655
how my life would have been different

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.061
had this man not injured me,

00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:32.942
had my genes been fed a different helping of experience.

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:35.155
Who was I?

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:37.972
Was I who I had been before the crash,

00:06:37.972 --> 00:06:42.033
before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:44.322
Was I what had been done to me?

00:06:44.322 --> 00:06:48.715
Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,

00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:51.055
the infidelity of a parent or spouse,

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.242
money inherited?

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:57.380
Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.345
It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,

00:07:00.345 --> 00:07:03.835
but how to tease out the one from the other?

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:06.677
As Yeats put that same universal question,

00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:09.871
"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,

00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:16.186
how can we know the dancer from the dance?"

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.445
I'd been driving for an hour

00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:22.172
when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:25.981
The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:28.539
The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.749
as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:33.389
that had propelled me as a teen

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.810
to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.400
But I also saw in my reflection

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.247
that, had Abed not injured me,

00:07:42.247 --> 00:07:45.234
I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:48.757
and a husband and a father.

00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:51.235
I would be less mindful of time and of death,

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:53.056
and, oh, I would not be disabled,

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.564
would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.

00:07:56.564 --> 00:07:59.219
The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth

00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:01.565
come from biting at all the many things

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.346
a solitary hand cannot open.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:09.785
The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.

00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:11.911
It was approaching 11 when I exited right

00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:14.070
toward Afula, and passed a large quarry

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.523
and was soon in Kfar Kara.

00:08:16.523 --> 00:08:18.986
I felt a pang of nerves.

00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:22.789
But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:25.019
and I pulled into a lot by a gas station

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:28.360
to listen and to calm.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.592
I'd been told that in an Arab town,

00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:32.797
one need only mention the name of a local

00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:35.077
and it will be recognized.

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:37.087
And I was mentioning Abed and myself,

00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:39.445
noting deliberately that I was here in peace,

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:41.581
to the people in this town,

00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:44.864
when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.

00:08:44.864 --> 00:08:47.306
He listened to me.

00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:50.130
You know, it was most often when speaking to people

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.070
that I wondered where I ended and my disability began,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.948
for many people told me what they told no one else.

00:08:56.948 --> 00:08:59.254
Many cried.

00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:01.898
And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same

00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:03.794
and I later asked her why,

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.768
she told me that, best she could tell, her tears

00:09:05.768 --> 00:09:09.044
had had something to do with my being happy and strong,

00:09:09.044 --> 00:09:11.731
but vulnerable too.

00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.014
I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:16.276
I was me,

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:18.430
but I was now me despite a limp,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.592
and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:24.394
Anyway, Mohamed told me

00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:27.175
what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:31.286
He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:33.984
And as I sat contemplating what to say,

00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:37.418
a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.

00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:39.798
I stepped from my car and said "Shalom,"

00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:41.835
and identified myself,

00:09:41.835 --> 00:09:43.264
and she told me that her husband Abed

00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:46.116
would be home from work in four hours.

00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:48.632
Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed

00:09:48.632 --> 00:09:51.772
that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.

00:09:51.772 --> 00:09:55.496
(Laughter)

00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:58.521
I drove off and returned at 4:30,

00:09:58.521 --> 00:09:59.797
thankful to the minaret up the road

00:09:59.797 --> 00:10:02.331
that helped me find my way back.

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:04.428
And as I approached the front door,

00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:07.853
Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,

00:10:07.853 --> 00:10:12.639
and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:15.662
He wore black and white: slippers over socks,

00:10:15.662 --> 00:10:17.761
pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,

00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.073
a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.

00:10:21.073 --> 00:10:23.570
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.853
And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,

00:10:27.853 --> 00:10:29.940
and I gave him my gift,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.331
and he told me I was a guest in his home,

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.744
and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:37.505
It was then that Abed resumed at once

00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:39.361
the tale of woe he had begun over the phone

00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.325
16 years before.

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:45.630
He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.827
He had problems with his side and his legs too,

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:50.369
and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.

00:10:50.369 --> 00:10:53.340
Did I wish to see him remove them?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.870
Abed then rose and turned on the TV

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.728
so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,

00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.967
and returned with polaroids of the crash

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:03.577
and his old driver's license.

00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:07.384
"I was handsome," he said.

00:11:07.384 --> 00:11:09.562
We looked down at his laminated mug.

00:11:09.562 --> 00:11:12.318
Abed had been less handsome than substantial,

00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:16.110
with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.047
It was this youth who on May 16, 1990,

00:11:19.047 --> 00:11:21.196
had broken two necks including mine,

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:25.144
and bruised one brain and taken one life.

00:11:25.144 --> 00:11:27.743
Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,

00:11:27.743 --> 00:11:29.492
his skin slack on his face,

00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:32.223
and looking at Abed looking at his young self,

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:34.606
I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:38.932
after the crash, and recognized his longing.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:43.049
"The crash changed both of our lives," I said.

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:45.777
Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,

00:11:45.777 --> 00:11:48.365
and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver

00:11:48.365 --> 00:11:51.538
in the left lane who did not let him pass.

00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:54.260
I did not want to recap the crash with Abed.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.029
I'd hoped for something simpler:

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.834
to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.

00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:03.423
And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.469
the morning after the crash,

00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:07.854
Abed did not even mention the bus driver.

00:12:07.854 --> 00:12:11.218
No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.

00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:14.226
I had come for remorse.

00:12:14.226 --> 00:12:16.382
And so I now went looking for remorse

00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:18.667
and threw truth under the bus.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:21.793
"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,

00:12:21.793 --> 00:12:26.182
but does it make you sad that others suffered?"

00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:28.577
Abed spoke three quick words.

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:32.369
"Yes, I suffered."

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:35.305
Abed then told me why he'd suffered.

00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:38.444
He'd lived an unholy life before the crash,

00:12:38.444 --> 00:12:40.773
and so God had ordained the crash,

00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:44.596
but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:47.737
It was then that God intervened:

00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:50.511
news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before

00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:53.283
had killed three people up north.

00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:55.656
We looked up at the wreckage.

00:12:55.656 --> 00:12:58.677
"Strange," I said.

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.462
"Strange," he agreed.

00:13:01.462 --> 00:13:04.157
I had the thought that there, on Route 804,

00:13:04.157 --> 00:13:06.287
there were perpetrators and victims,

00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:08.023
dyads bound by a crash.

00:13:08.023 --> 00:13:10.484
Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:13.694
Some, as had I, would remember.

00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:16.819
The report finished and Abed spoke.

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:19.192
"It is a pity," he said, "that the police

00:13:19.192 --> 00:13:24.086
in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:27.114
I was baffled.

00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:29.893
Abed had said something remarkable.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:33.359
Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:35.261
Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion

00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:37.644
that he should have been put away longer?

00:13:37.644 --> 00:13:41.256
He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:43.282
I forgot my discretion.

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:46.726
"Um, Abed," I said,

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:50.957
"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."

00:13:50.957 --> 00:13:54.918
"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40."

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:58.319
And so 27 violations --

00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:01.024
driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,

00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:03.006
driving on the wrong side of a barrier,

00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:05.046
and finally, riding his brakes down that hill --

00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:07.504
reduced to one.

00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:10.991
And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,

00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:14.106
the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.

00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:18.023
The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:24.727
It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.

00:14:24.727 --> 00:14:28.023
Abed and I sat with our coffee.

00:14:28.023 --> 00:14:30.815
We'd spent 90 minutes together,

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:33.177
and he was now known to me.

00:14:33.177 --> 00:14:35.545
He was not a particularly bad man

00:14:35.545 --> 00:14:37.878
or a particularly good man.

00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.036
He was a limited man

00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:43.066
who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.

00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:44.576
With a nod to Jewish custom,

00:14:44.576 --> 00:14:48.523
he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.

00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:50.344
But it was hard for me to relate to one who had

00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:53.642
so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:58.006
to one whose life was so unexamined that he said

00:14:58.006 --> 00:15:02.781
he thought two people had died in the crash.

00:15:05.012 --> 00:15:08.636
There was much I wished to say to Abed.

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:12.341
I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,

00:15:12.341 --> 00:15:14.516
it would be okay,

00:15:14.516 --> 00:15:16.314
for people are wrong to marvel

00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:19.556
at those like me who smile as we limp.

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:23.492
People don't know that they have lived through worse,

00:15:23.492 --> 00:15:27.154
that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,

00:15:27.154 --> 00:15:29.505
that problems of the mind are greater still,

00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:33.681
more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.

00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:36.531
I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are

00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:38.032
most of all

00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:40.465
is not our minds and not our bodies

00:15:40.465 --> 00:15:42.273
and not what happens to us,

00:15:42.273 --> 00:15:45.135
but how we respond to what happens to us.

00:15:45.135 --> 00:15:47.713
"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:49.530
"is the last of the human freedoms:

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.430
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.254
I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers

00:15:57.254 --> 00:16:01.125
and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:03.102
but we all must --

00:16:03.102 --> 00:16:07.988
the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding

00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:11.833
and the bankrupt and everyone.

00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:14.438
I wished to tell him that one does not have to say

00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:16.454
that a bad thing is good,

00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:19.002
that a crash is from God and so a crash is good,

00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:20.693
a broken neck is good.

00:16:20.693 --> 00:16:23.953
One can say that a bad thing sucks,

00:16:23.953 --> 00:16:28.075
but that this natural world still has many glories.

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:33.101
I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:

00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:36.328
We have to rise above bad fortune.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:39.354
We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,

00:16:39.354 --> 00:16:45.238
study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship --

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:49.007
and community and love.

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:51.766
But most of all, I wished to tell him

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:54.135
what Herman Melville wrote,

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:57.062
that "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,

00:16:57.062 --> 00:17:00.119
some small part of you must be cold,

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:02.422
for there is no quality in this world

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:05.714
that is not what it is merely by contrast."

00:17:05.714 --> 00:17:08.155
Yes, contrast.

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:10.494
If you are mindful of what you do not have,

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:13.722
you may be truly mindful of what you do have,

00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:17.616
and if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.

00:17:17.616 --> 00:17:20.045
That is the one singular gift you may receive

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:23.016
if you suffer in any existential way.

00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:25.345
You know death, and so may wake each morning

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.375
pulsing with ready life.

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:28.970
Some part of you is cold,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.469
and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.391
or even to be cold.

00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:37.415
When one morning, years after the crash,

00:17:37.415 --> 00:17:40.198
I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot

00:17:40.198 --> 00:17:43.661
felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,

00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:48.948
it was exhilarating, a gust of snow.

00:17:48.948 --> 00:17:52.184
But I didn't say these things to Abed.

00:17:52.184 --> 00:17:56.985
I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.

00:17:56.985 --> 00:18:01.459
I told him the name of that man.

00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:05.272
And then I said, "Goodbye."

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:07.189
Thank you.

00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:13.924
(Applause)

00:18:13.924 --> 00:18:16.660
Thanks a lot.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.660
(Applause)
