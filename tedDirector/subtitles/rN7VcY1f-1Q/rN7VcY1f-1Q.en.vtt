00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
because of their tall stature, their complex structure,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
I used to climb trees for fun all the time

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.330
and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
and forests, through the medium of science.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
and share with you what canopy researchers are asking

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.330
and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
Let's start our journey on the forest floor

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
you'll notice that the understory is very dark,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
it's very still.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
but rather showing you a very short clip

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
from a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
to climb a giant strangler fig.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:02:01.330
(Music)

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
(Growling)

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:14.330
(Rustling)

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
to make their way and their life in the canopy.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.330
Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
and tell you about the ants.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists --

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
people who describe and name animals -- have named.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.330
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
One of the reasons I tell you about ants

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did --

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
We've had two children, August Andrew and Erika

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and actually, he named ants after them.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
But my passion -- in addition to Jack and my children --

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
those plants that grow up on trees.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.330
They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.330
to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
These plants occur in great diversity,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
over 28,000 species around the world.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
They grow in tropical forests like this one

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.330
One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.330
And these mosses, generated by decomposing,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
are like peat moss in your garden.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.330
They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
One of the surprising things I discovered

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.330
what you'll find underneath them are connections, networks

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
of what we call canopy roots.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
These are not epiphyte roots:

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
We've done stripping experiments

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
where we've removed mats of epiphytes

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
and looked at the rates of recolonization.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
and that they would come in encroaching from the side.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time --

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
over 20 years -- to regenerate,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
starting from the bottom and growing up.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
And even now, after 25 years,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
they're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
And I use this little image to say

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
this is what happens to mosses.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
If it's gone, it's gone,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.330
(Laughter)

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
So, recolonization is really very slow.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
These canopy communities are fragile.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
of the intact primary forest,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.330
is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
We know it's a lot,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
but we do not yet know the answers to how much,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.330
held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
that Tarzan and Jane were interested in,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
but rather that they foster biodiversity

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
and they also help to keep our global climate stable.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
you would also see scenes like this.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
and forest fragmentation,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
when it is not disturbed by humans.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
I've also looked out on urban places like this

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
People who grew up in a place like this

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.330
did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
and forests, as I did when I was a young girl.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
This troubles me.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
and trying to figure out how we can answer them.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
far away from the areas of power and money,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
How can I reconnect people with trees?"

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Well, I think that I can do something.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
I know that as a scientist, I have information

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
inside or outside of academia.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
And so, that's what I've begin doing,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.330
and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
We consult to the media about canopy questions;

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
we have a canopy newsletter;

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
we have an email LISTSERV.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.330
the beauty of the canopy,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
the necessity of intact canopies,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
to people outside of academia.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.330
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make --

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
those videos and so forth --

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
you know, they don't reach everybody,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
What we do, my students in my lab and I,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.330
we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
and we send her out with a canopy handbook.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.330
And my feeling is --

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
(Applause)

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
Thank you.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
(Applause)

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
-- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
to become an ambassador who can carry the message

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.330
that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
We've also made partnerships with artists,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
of trees and forest canopies.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.330
and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
The results have been fantastic.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
I'll just give you a few examples.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
at Rhode Island School of Design.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.330
in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
We've had dance people up in the canopy.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
They made a fabulous dance called "Biome."

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
They danced in the forest,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.330
and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
and also linking up with environmental groups,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
to go to different cities and to perform

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
the science, the dance and the environmental outreach

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
that we hope will make a difference.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
We brought musicians to the canopy,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
we had opera singers, we had guitar players,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
and we had rap singers.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
And I brought a little segment to give you

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.330
of Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
(Music) That's Duke!

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.330
(Applause)

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
This experience of working with Duke

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth --

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
I don't have a hope of getting to --

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
Caution would rap on it,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
and suddenly that branch was really cool.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And then the students would come into our sound studios,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
They ended up making a CD

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
which they took home to their family and friends,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
thereby expressing their own experiences with nature

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
in their own medium.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
and it involves an economic and social value

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
that is associated with epiphytic plants.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
In the Pacific Northwest,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
from old-growth forests.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
These mosses are taken from the forest;

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
It's a 265 million dollar industry

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
and it's increasing rapidly.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
If you remember that bald guy,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
is going to take decades and decades to come back.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
So this whole industry is unsustainable.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
that would be great.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women --

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
who don't have access to nature,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
who often have a lot of time, they often have space,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses --

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
would be great partners.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
And they have become excellent partners.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
The best I can imagine.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
They were very enthusiastic.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.330
(Applause)

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
which, to tell you the truth,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.330
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
in order to grow these mosses.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
We've been successful as partners

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
in figuring out which species grow the fastest,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.330
Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.330
I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
We gave talks once a month,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
and that actually ended up implementing

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons --

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
Our latest endeavor,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
with a grant

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.330
they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
So they will raise them -- in captivity, of course --

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:34.330
And they will have the pleasure, many of them,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.330
to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
And so, I think for many reasons --

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual --

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
this has been a tremendous project

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
and I'm really looking forward to

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
not only myself and my students doing it,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.330
but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.330
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
to have their own partnerships

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
with people outside of the academic community.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:26.330
Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
and make an opera about AIDS.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.330
Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
that would really make you clap your hands.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.330
Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
it is time for scientists to reach outward,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:50.330
and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.330
I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
with the tools of science.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
By making these partnerships that I described to you,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.330
I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
to have a greater understanding,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
to make other discoveries about nature and myself.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
When I look into my heart, I see trees --

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
this is actually an image of a real heart --

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
there are trees in our hearts,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
there are trees in your hearts.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
When we come to understand nature,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.330
we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
In these partnerships, I have also learned

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
that people tend to compartmentalize themselves

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.330
into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
but when we share nature,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
when we share our perspectives about nature,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
we find a common denominator.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
Finally, as a scientist and as a person

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
and now, as part of the TED community,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
I feel that I have better tools

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.330
to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
to make new discoveries about nature --

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
and about humans' place in nature

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.330
wherever we are and whomever you are.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
Thank you very much.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:23.330
(Applause)
