00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.678
Good morning. How are you?

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:30.912
(Laughter)

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.249
It's been great, hasn't it?

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:35.729
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:37.245
In fact, I'm leaving.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.836
(Laughter)

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.222
There have been three themes
running through the conference

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.753
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:53.467
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.904
in all of the presentations that we've had

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.729
and in all of the people here.

00:00:57.753 --> 00:01:00.404
Just the variety of it
and the range of it.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.301
The second is
that it's put us in a place

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.822
where we have no idea
what's going to happen,

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:07.237
in terms of the future.

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.976
No idea how this may play out.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.892
I have an interest in education.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:16.048
Actually, what I find is everybody
has an interest in education.

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:17.210
Don't you?

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:18.715
I find this very interesting.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.496
If you're at a dinner party,

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:22.858
and you say you work in education --

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.846
Actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.666
(Laughter)

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.118
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.233
(Laughter)

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:38.976
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.475
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.276
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.976
and you say you work in education,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.076
you can see the blood run from their face.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.380
They're like, "Oh my God,"
you know, "Why me?"

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:51.041
(Laughter)

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.688
"My one night out all week."

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:55.322
(Laughter)

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:58.587
But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall.

00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.078
Because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:05.535
Like religion, and money and other things.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.911
So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.827
We have a huge vested interest in it,

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.171
partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:16.714
that we can't grasp.

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:20.372
If you think of it,
children starting school this year

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:23.920
will be retiring in 2065.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.843
Nobody has a clue,

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.311
despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.976
what the world will look like
in five years' time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.294
And yet we're meant
to be educating them for it.

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.868
So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:39.259
And the third part of this

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:41.320
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:46.649
on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:49.007
their capacities for innovation.

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.542
I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:53.176
Just seeing what she could do.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.976
And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.956
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.776
What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.067
who found a talent.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.700
And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.776
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.976
So I want to talk about education

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.872
and I want to talk about creativity.

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:20.915
My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.803
and we should treat it
with the same status.

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:25.798
(Applause) Thank you.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:30.167
(Applause)

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:31.744
That was it, by the way.

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:32.771
Thank you very much.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.910
(Laughter)

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:36.611
So, 15 minutes left.

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.571
(Laughter)

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:41.487
Well, I was born... no.

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:44.543
(Laughter)

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:47.312
I heard a great story recently
-- I love telling it --

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:50.051
of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.210
She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,

00:03:52.234 --> 00:03:55.034
and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,

00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:56.844
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:58.208
The teacher was fascinated.

00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:00.994
She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"

00:04:01.018 --> 00:04:03.509
And the girl said, "I'm
drawing a picture of God."

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.960
And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.072
And the girl said,
"They will, in a minute."

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:16.878
(Laughter)

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.929
When my son was four in England --

00:04:24.413 --> 00:04:26.604
Actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.295
(Laughter)

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:31.791
If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:34.453
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:35.696
(Laughter)

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.547
No, it was big, it was a big story.

00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.876
Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.161
(Laughter)

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:42.495
"Nativity II."

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:46.654
But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:49.215
We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:51.716
We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.976
"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.607
He didn't have to speak,

00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.069
but you know the bit
where the three kings come in?

00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:00.824
They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:01.962
This really happened.

00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:05.076
We were sitting there and I think
they just went out of sequence,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.876
because we talked to the little boy
afterward and we said,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.776
"You OK with that?" And he said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.876
They just switched.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.076
The three boys came in,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.287
four-year-olds with tea towels
on their heads,

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.802
and they put these boxes down,

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:18.875
and the first boy said,
"I bring you gold."

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:21.037
And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:23.065
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.989
(Laughter)

00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:38.801
What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:41.433
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:44.994
Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:49.400
I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:52.976
What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.367
you'll never come up
with anything original --

00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.476
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

00:05:57.877 --> 00:06:02.010
And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.

00:06:02.406 --> 00:06:04.926
They have become
frightened of being wrong.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.640
And we run our companies like this.

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:08.316
We stigmatize mistakes.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.642
And we're now running
national education systems

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:13.012
where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.908
And the result is that
we are educating people

00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:19.223
out of their creative capacities.

00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:23.725
Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.971
The problem is to remain an artist
as we grow up.

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:30.076
I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.956
we grow out of it.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.863
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:35.720
So why is this?

00:06:35.826 --> 00:06:39.907
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:42.184
In fact, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles.

00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:45.536
So you can imagine
what a seamless transition that was.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.976
(Laughter)

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.376
Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.651
just outside Stratford,

00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:52.836
which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:55.457
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.076
You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.976
Do you? Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.567
Shakespeare being seven?

00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.840
I never thought of it.

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:06.548
I mean, he was seven at some point.

00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:08.882
He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:15.693
(Laughter)

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.046
How annoying would that be?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.070
(Laughter)

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:25.764
"Must try harder."

00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:29.688
(Laughter)

00:07:29.712 --> 00:07:33.176
Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.628
And put the pencil down."

00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:36.726
(Laughter)

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.305
"And stop speaking like that."

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:42.220
(Laughter)

00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:43.568
"It's confusing everybody."

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:48.715
(Laughter)

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:54.077
Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.542
and I just want to say a word
about the transition.

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:57.976
My son didn't want to come.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.976
I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.044
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:06.024
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:09.651
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:11.136
He'd known her for a month.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.510
(Laughter)

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.790
Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,

00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:17.753
because it's a long time when you're 16.

00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:19.438
He was really upset on the plane,

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:21.923
he said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."

00:08:21.947 --> 00:08:24.325
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:27.249
(Laughter)

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.276
Because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.300
(Laughter)

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.401
But something strikes you
when you move to America

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:44.791
and travel around the world:

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:48.193
Every education system on Earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.

00:08:48.537 --> 00:08:50.492
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.786
You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.776
At the top are mathematics and languages,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.234
then the humanities,
and at the bottom are the arts.

00:08:57.258 --> 00:08:58.376
Everywhere on Earth.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.495
And in pretty much every system too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.376
Art and music are normally
given a higher status in schools

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.567
than drama and dance.

00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:08.847
There isn't an education
system on the planet

00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:10.929
that teaches dance everyday to children

00:09:10.953 --> 00:09:13.000
the way we teach them mathematics. Why?

00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:16.225
Why not? I think this is rather important.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:18.552
I think math is very
important, but so is dance.

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:21.476
Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.976
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.338
(Laughter)

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.845
Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.637
we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.

00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:34.286
And then we focus on their heads.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.800
And slightly to one side.

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:38.976
If you were to visit
education, as an alien,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.976
and say "What's it for, public education?"

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.776
I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.176
who really succeeds by this,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.976
who does everything that they should,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.731
who gets all the brownie
points, who are the winners --

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:54.094
I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education

00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:55.215
throughout the world

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:57.192
is to produce university professors.

00:09:57.216 --> 00:09:58.527
Isn't it?

00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:00.534
They're the people who come out the top.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.737
And I used to be one, so there.

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:05.397
(Laughter)

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:08.522
And I like university
professors, but you know,

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:10.021
we shouldn't hold them up

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:12.976
as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.976
They're just a form of life,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.560
another form of life.

00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:19.882
But they're rather curious, and I say this
out of affection for them.

00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:22.876
There's something curious
about professors in my experience --

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.576
not all of them, but typically,
they live in their heads.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.743
They live up there,
and slightly to one side.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:31.869
They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.

00:10:31.893 --> 00:10:34.986
They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:41.176
(Laughter)

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.216
Don't they?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.462
It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:49.998
(Laughter)

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:53.852
If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences,

00:10:53.876 --> 00:10:57.362
get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics,

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:59.629
and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.

00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:02.454
(Laughter)

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:03.834
And there, you will see it.

00:11:03.858 --> 00:11:07.976
Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.867
(Laughter)

00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:14.216
Waiting until it ends so they can
go home and write a paper about it.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.144
(Laughter)

00:11:16.168 --> 00:11:20.011
Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:21.276
And there's a reason.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.856
Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.986
really, before the 19th century.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.967
They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:32.432
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

00:11:32.456 --> 00:11:37.053
Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.

00:11:37.077 --> 00:11:39.108
So you were
probably steered benignly away

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.066
from things at school when you
were a kid, things you liked,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.476
on the grounds that you would
never get a job doing that. Is that right?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.881
Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:49.706
don't do art, you won't be an artist.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.150
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:55.319
The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:57.440
And the second is academic ability,

00:11:57.464 --> 00:12:00.349
which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.276
because the universities designed
the system in their image.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.794
If you think of it, the whole system
of public education around the world

00:12:06.818 --> 00:12:09.044
is a protracted process
of university entrance.

00:12:09.068 --> 00:12:11.401
And the consequence
is that many highly-talented,

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:13.860
brilliant, creative
people think they're not,

00:12:13.884 --> 00:12:16.022
because the thing
they were good at at school

00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:18.154
wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.

00:12:18.383 --> 00:12:20.679
And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.

00:12:20.703 --> 00:12:23.167
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:26.001
more people worldwide will be graduating

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:28.571
through education
than since the beginning of history.

00:12:28.595 --> 00:12:32.276
More people, and it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about --

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.348
technology and its transformation
effect on work, and demography

00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:37.176
and the huge explosion in population.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.065
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:41.469
Isn't that true?

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:44.476
When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.276
If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.976
And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.074
But now kids with degrees

00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:57.143
are often heading home
to carry on playing video games,

00:12:57.167 --> 00:13:00.365
because you need an MA where
the previous job required a BA,

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:02.176
and now you need a PhD for the other.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.976
It's a process of academic inflation.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.376
And it indicates the whole
structure of education

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.833
is shifting beneath our feet.

00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:10.477
We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.

00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:12.496
We know three things about intelligence.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.747
One, it's diverse.

00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:16.776
We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.776
We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.101
We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.

00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:24.000
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:26.976
If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.976
as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.976
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.238
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

00:13:34.873 --> 00:13:37.976
In fact, creativity --
which I define as the process

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.325
of having original ideas
that have value --

00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:43.001
more often than not comes about
through the interaction

00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:46.025
of different disciplinary
ways of seeing things.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.976
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.491
called the corpus callosum.

00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:53.781
It's thicker in women.

00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:55.829
Following off from Helen yesterday,

00:13:55.853 --> 00:13:58.976
this is probably why women
are better at multi-tasking.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.817
Because you are, aren't you?

00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.048
There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.

00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:09.976
If my wife is cooking a meal at home --
which is not often, thankfully.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.854
(Laughter)

00:14:12.878 --> 00:14:15.376
No, she's good at some things,
but if she's cooking,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.276
she's dealing with people on the phone,

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.856
she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.976
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.976
If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.976
the phone's on the hook,
if she comes in I get annoyed.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.071
I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:38.825
(Laughter)

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.454
"Give me a break."

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:42.198
(Laughter)

00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:44.721
Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:47.998
if a tree falls in a forest
and nobody hears it, did it happen?

00:14:48.252 --> 00:14:49.581
Remember that old chestnut?

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:52.014
I saw a great t-shirt
recently, which said,

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:55.976
"If a man speaks his mind
in a forest, and no woman hears him,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.396
is he still wrong?"

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.026
(Laughter)

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.976
And the third thing about intelligence is,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.369
it's distinct.

00:15:08.754 --> 00:15:11.327
I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"

00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:13.825
which is based on a series
of interviews with people

00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:15.769
about how they discovered their talent.

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:17.962
I'm fascinated
by how people got to be there.

00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:21.176
It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.876
who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.530
Have you heard of her? Some have.

00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:28.076
She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.101
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:31.103
She's wonderful.

00:15:31.127 --> 00:15:33.273
I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet,

00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:34.498
as you can see.

00:15:34.522 --> 00:15:36.922
Anyway, Gillian and I had
lunch one day and I said,

00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:38.847
"How did you get to be a dancer?"

00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:39.976
It was interesting.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.350
When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:45.976
And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
"We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."

00:15:48.024 --> 00:15:50.166
She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.480
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.
Wouldn't you?

00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:57.563
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.

00:15:57.587 --> 00:15:59.976
It wasn't an available condition.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.737
(Laughter)

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.821
People weren't aware they could have that.

00:16:04.845 --> 00:16:06.979
(Laughter)

00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:11.281
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:15.027
So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,

00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:17.528
and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:21.191
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes
while this man talked to her mother

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:23.543
about the problems
Gillian was having at school.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:27.244
Because she was disturbing people;
her homework was always late; and so on,

00:16:27.268 --> 00:16:28.364
little kid of eight.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:31.443
In the end, the doctor
went and sat next to Gillian, and said,

00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:34.172
"I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me,

00:16:34.196 --> 00:16:35.815
I need to speak to her privately.

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.215
Wait here. We'll be back;
we won't be very long,"

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:40.564
and they went and left her.

00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:42.224
But as they went out of the room,

00:16:42.248 --> 00:16:44.748
he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.

00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:48.772
And when they got out, he said to her
mother, "Just stand and watch her."

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.991
And the minute they left the room,

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:54.499
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

00:16:54.523 --> 00:16:57.976
And they watched for a few minutes
and he turned to her mother and said,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.976
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian
isn't sick; she's a dancer.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.976
Take her to a dance school."

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.976
I said, "What happened?"

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.976
She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.753
We walked in this room
and it was full of people like me.

00:17:11.777 --> 00:17:13.976
People who couldn't sit still.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.587
People who had to move to think."
Who had to move to think.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:22.376
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.220
She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School;

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.543
she became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:31.175
She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.175
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.443
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:17:34.568 --> 00:17:35.977
She's been responsible for

00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:39.147
some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,

00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:42.244
she's given pleasure to millions,
and she's a multi-millionaire.

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:46.339
Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.

00:17:46.364 --> 00:17:53.146
(Applause)

00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:55.176
What I think it comes to is this:

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.976
Al Gore spoke the other night

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.269
about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

00:18:02.111 --> 00:18:04.277
I believe our only hope for the future

00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:08.134
is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,

00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:10.976
one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.976
of the richness of human capacity.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.499
Our education system has mined our minds

00:18:16.523 --> 00:18:19.799
in the way that we strip-mine the earth:
for a particular commodity.

00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:22.672
And for the future, it won't serve us.

00:18:22.696 --> 00:18:24.976
We have to rethink
the fundamental principles

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.968
on which we're educating our children.

00:18:27.087 --> 00:18:29.761
There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:34.824
"If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:37.689
within 50 years all life
on Earth would end.

00:18:38.688 --> 00:18:41.760
If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,

00:18:41.784 --> 00:18:44.418
within 50 years all forms
of life would flourish."

00:18:45.244 --> 00:18:46.529
And he's right.

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:50.925
What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:53.488
We have to be careful now

00:18:53.512 --> 00:18:55.767
that we use this gift wisely

00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:59.020
and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:02.976
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing
our creative capacities

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.610
for the richness they are

00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:07.816
and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.238
And our task is to educate
their whole being,

00:19:10.262 --> 00:19:11.746
so they can face this future.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.976
By the way -- we may not see this future,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.430
but they will.

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:18.533
And our job is to help them
make something of it.

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.557
Thank you very much.

00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:22.581
