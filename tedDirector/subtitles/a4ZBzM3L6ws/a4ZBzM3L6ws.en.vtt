00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.087
According to the UN,

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.357
billions of people still live
without an address.

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:21.435
The economist Hernando de Soto said,

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:22.817
"Without an address,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:24.743
you live outside the law.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.385
You might as well not exist."

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.830
I'm here to tell you how my team and I
are trying to change that.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:35.202
If you go to an online map
and look at a favela in Brazil

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.050
or a township in South Africa,

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.053
you'll see a few streets
but a lot of empty space.

00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:42.821
But if you flip to satellite view,

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:45.959
there are thousands of people,
homes and businesses

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.019
in this vast, unmapped
and unaddressed spaces.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:51.411
In Ghana's capital, Accra,

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:55.524
there are numbers and letters
scrawled onto the sides of walls,

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:58.677
where they piloted address systems
but not finished them.

00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:03.299
But these places,
these unaddressed places,

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:05.319
hold huge economic potential.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.602
Here's why the issue
of addressing stuck with me.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.505
I worked in the music
business for 10 years,

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:14.907
and what you may not know
about the music world

00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.344
is that every day, people struggle
with the problems of addressing.

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:21.197
So from the musicians
who have to find the gigs

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:23.650
to the production companies
who bring the equipment,

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:25.736
everyone somehow always gets lost.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.901
We even had to add someone
to our schedules

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:30.744
who was the person you called
when you thought you'd arrived

00:01:30.768 --> 00:01:32.152
but then realized you hadn't.

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:34.499
And we had some pretty bad days,

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:37.708
like in Italy, where a truck driver
unloaded all the equipment

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:40.315
an hour north of Rome,
not an hour south of Rome,

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:41.548
and a slightly worse day

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:43.647
where a keyboard player
called me and said,

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.585
"Chris, don't panic,
but we may have just sound-checked

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.172
at the wrong people's wedding."

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:49.771
(Laughter)

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:52.433
So not long after the fated Rome event,

00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:54.566
I chatted this through
with a friend of mine

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.754
who is a mathematician,

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.588
and we thought it was a problem
we could do something about.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:00.949
We thought, well,
we could make a new system,

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:03.045
but it shouldn't look like the old system.

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:05.743
We agreed that addresses were bad.

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:08.500
We knew we wanted something very precise,

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:10.879
but GPS coordinates,
latitude and longitude,

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:12.386
were just too complicated.

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:16.099
So we divided the world
into three-meter squares.

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:20.676
The world divides into around 57 trillion
three-meter squares,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.891
and we found that there are
enough combinations

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:24.725
of three dictionary words

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.341
that we could name every three-meter
square in the world uniquely

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:29.721
with just three words.

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.117
We used 40,000 words,

00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:33.734
so that's 40,000 cubed,

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:36.991
64 trillion combinations of three words,

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:40.903
which is more than enough for
the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.110
with a few spare.

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:44.993
So that's exactly what we did.

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:48.091
We divided the world
into three-meter squares,

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:50.956
gave each one a unique,
three-word identifier --

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.712
what we call a three-word address.

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:56.457
So for example, right here,

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.676
I'm standing at mustards.coupons.pinup,

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:00.008
(Laughter)

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:01.883
but over here ...

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:05.701
I'm standing at pinched.
singularly.tutorial.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:11.104
But we haven't just done this in English.

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:14.557
We thought it was essential that people
should be able to use this system

00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:15.843
in their own language.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:18.100
So far, we've built it into 14 languages,

00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:20.567
including French, Swahili and Arabic,

00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.423
and we're working on more now,
like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:27.004
But this idea can do a lot more

00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:29.728
than just get my musicians
to their gigs on time.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:33.929
If the 75 percent of countries
that struggle with reliable addressing

00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:35.657
started using three-word addresses,

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.513
there's a stack of far more
important applications.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.463
In Durban, South Africa,

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.144
an NGO called Gateway Health

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:47.118
have distributed 11,000
three-word address signs

00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:48.531
to their community,

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.934
so the pregnant mothers,
when they go into labor,

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.766
can call the emergency services

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.141
and tell them exactly
where to pick them up from,

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:58.518
because otherwise, the ambulances
have often taken hours to find them.

00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:02.241
In Mongolia, the National Post Service
have adopted the system

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:04.703
and are now doing deliveries
to many people's houses

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:06.128
for the first time.

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:09.835
The UN are using it
to geotag photos in disaster zones

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.531
so they can deliver aid
to exactly the right place.

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:15.225
Even Domino's Pizza
are using it in the Caribbean,

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.950
because they haven't been able
to find customers' homes,

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.169
but they really want to get
their pizza to them while its still hot.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.250
Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car,

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:26.010
speak the three words,

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:28.391
and the car will navigate you
to that exact spot.

00:04:29.888 --> 00:04:33.413
In Africa, the continent
has leapfrogged phone lines

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:34.830
to go to mobile phones,

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:38.333
bypassed traditional banks
to go straight to mobile payments.

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:43.252
We're really proud that the post services
of three African countries --

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.872
Nigeria, Djibouti and CÃ´te d'Ivoire,

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.548
have gone straight to adopting
three-word addresses,

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:50.645
which means that people in those countries

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.841
have a really simple way
to explain where they live, today.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:58.846
For me, poor addressing
was an annoying frustration,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.374
but for billions of people,

00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:03.811
it's a huge business inefficiency,

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:06.516
severely hampers
their infrastructure growth,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.824
and can cost lives.

00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:10.465
We're on a mission to change that,

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:11.702
three words at a time.

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:12.877
Thank you.

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:17.418
(Applause)
