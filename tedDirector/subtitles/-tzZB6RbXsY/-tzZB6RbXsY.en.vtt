00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I'm going to talk about two stories today.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.160
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
in the transportation sector.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
if we choose the right wireless technologies;

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm really scared.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
in order to avert catastrophic effects.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
that will result in 50 percent species extinction.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
It's not a movie. This is real life.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
-- which I know something about --

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.160
the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.160
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.160
those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
That is not enough.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
but it's an example of something called car sharing.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
It means that I pay only for what I need.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.160
And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
that I can have at my beck and call,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
but heaven forbid I would ever maintain

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
So, what is the social result of this?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.160
People adore the company. And it's better,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
you know? They like it.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And for me, as a service provider,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
if the transaction cost was anything.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
I'm launching it in about three weeks --

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160
and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
This will apply to people across all of America.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.160
yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
to completely change how people feel about ridesharing

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
and make that trip much more efficient.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
And so when I think about the future,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
is this incredibly great social event out of their day.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And the social benefits:

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
I think we can get that down to 50 percent.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.160
and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.160
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160
there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And again, do people like the outcome?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Ken Livingstone was reelected.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.160
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
to reduce their driving behavior.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
There's a huge slack in that system;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
with the right pricing we can undo that.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and is, again, wirelessly enabled.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
and open and shut those gates.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
for something called road pricing.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
because today we pay for our maintenance

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.160
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
will be happening with road pricing.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Why do we travel too much?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
We need to put this better market feedback.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
what mode of travel, where to live and work.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.160
which is: when are we going to start doing

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
10 to 15 years for this to happen

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
This is my big vision.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.160
respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
provide a new engine for economic growth

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.160
and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
and I'm going to be the wise businessman.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.160
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
(Laughter)

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
These are also called mesh networks.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
I'm going to give you some examples.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
These laptops, when a child opens them up,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
they communicate with every single child in the classroom,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
within that school, within that village.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
And what is the cost of that communication system?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
Zero dollars a month.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Here's another example: in New Orleans,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
video cameras were mesh-enabled

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
When the hurricane happened,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
the only communication system standing was the mesh network.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
and for the next 12 months,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.160
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
You can look at the terminal

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.160
and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.160
and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.160
Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
So, the beauty of mesh networks:

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
you can have these very low-cost devices.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160
you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
What are the incredible weaknesses?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
because there's zero ongoing communications cost.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and networks are interesting only as they are big.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.160
How do we create a big network?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
These are the next two lines in the movie.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.160
"Where did you do it?" "In his car."

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160
So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.160
where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
is imagine if we put a mesh-network device

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
in every single car across America.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.160
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
I guess I just want you to think about that.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
we are going to do road tolls,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
gas taxes are going to become road pricing.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
These things are going to happen.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
We should pull it forward.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.160
So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.160
and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160
that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160
What is the point?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
We're transferring just a few little data bits

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
We have this incredible excess capacity.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Information should be free, and access to information should be free,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
and we should be charging people for carbon.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and I think this is as important and world changing

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
to our economy as electrification.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
And if I had my druthers,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.160
And this open-source version means that

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.160
it could be used around the world very quickly.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.160
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
-- his fabulous networks --

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
imagine if there was an open-source

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
mesh communications device that can be put into those networks,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
to make all that happen.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
this little slice of things is going to be for free.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
We could make billions of dollars on top of it,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160
but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
So, let's take control of this nightmare:

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
implement a gas tax immediately;

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.160
require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
and, of course, use mesh networks.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Thank you. (Applause)
