00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:14.241
Good afternoon.

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.782
My name is Uldus.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.755
I am a photo-based artist from Russia.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:22.784
I started my way around six years ago

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:25.810
with ironic self-portraits

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.780
to lay open so many stereotypes

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.222
about nationalities, genders,

00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:33.662
and social issues —

00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:36.665
["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"]
["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] (Laughter) —

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:41.233
using photography as my tool to send a message.
["Marry me, I need a visa."]

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.315
Today, I am still performing in front of the camera

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.162
and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:51.840
I focus on balancing meaningful message,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.860
aesthetic, beauty, composition, 
some irony, and artifacts.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.312
Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:04.271
which is named Desperate Romantics.

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.989
They're my artifacts, or paintings

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:10.817
from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:12.926
mid-19th century.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:14.940
I took the painting

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.182
and gifted new, contemporary meaning

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:22.037
talking about issues which are surrounding me

00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:23.377
in Russia,

00:01:23.377 --> 00:01:26.698
capturing people who are non-models

00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:29.780
but have an interesting story.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.929
This boy is a professional dancer,

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.512
only 12 years old,

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:37.440
but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.821
and is wearing the mask of brutality,

00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:44.145
trying to be united with the rest of his classmates

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.877
like a storm trooper has no personality.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.577
But this boy has goals and dreams

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:52.570
but hides it to be socially accepted,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.218
because being different isn't easy,

00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:57.515
especially in Russia.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:01.261
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:03.376
And this is Nikita,

00:02:03.376 --> 00:02:06.740
a security guard from one of the bars

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.607
in St. Petersburg.

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:12.207
He likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"

00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:14.198
quoting Hulk from the movie,

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:16.442
but I've never seen him angry.

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:19.947
He hides his sensitivities and romantic side,

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:21.938
because in Russia, among guys,

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:23.772
that's not cool to be romantic,

00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:26.520
but it's cool to be surrounded with women

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.823
and look like an aggressive hulk.

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:31.100
(Laughter)

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.480
Sometimes, in my project,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.350
I would take the painting

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.205
and give it new meaning

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:41.040
and new temptation about it.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.572
Sometimes, I would compare facial features

00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:46.858
and playing with words:

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:51.232
irony, Iron Man, ironing man.

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:54.527
(Laughter)

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:56.020
Through the artifacts,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.100
I bring social issues

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.806
which surround me in Russia into the conversation.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.809
Interesting fact about marriage in Russia,

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.285
that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:11.525
are already ready, and dream to get married.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.100
We're taught from childhood,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.385
successful marriage means successful life,

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.949
so most of the girls kind of fight

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.534
to get a good husband.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.787
And what about me?

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.822
I'm 27 years old.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.703
For Russian society, I'm an old maid

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:31.526
and hopeless to ever get married.

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:34.822
That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:39.209
in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.930
But remember, irony is the key,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.283
and this is actually to motivate girls

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:47.185
to fight for goals, for dreams,

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.481
and change stereotypes.

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:53.823
Be brave. Be ironic — it helps.

00:03:53.823 --> 00:03:57.962
Be funny and create some magic.

00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:01.962
(Applause)
