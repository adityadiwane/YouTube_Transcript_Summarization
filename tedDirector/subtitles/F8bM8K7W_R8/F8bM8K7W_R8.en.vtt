00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
My talk essentially got written

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
by three historic events

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that happened within days of each other

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in the last two months --

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
actually all having to do with

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the story I want to tell you today.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
The first one was actually a funeral --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
to be more precise, a reburial.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in Frombork, Poland

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
of the 16th-century astronomer

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
who actually changed the world.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
He did that, literally,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
by replacing the Earth with the Sun

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in the center of the Solar System,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and then with this simple-looking act,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
he actually launched a scientific

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and technological revolution,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
which many call the Copernican Revolution.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Now that was,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
ironically, and very befittingly,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
the way we found his grave.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
As it was the custom of the time,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Copernicus was actually

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
simply buried in an unmarked grave,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
together with 14 others

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
in that cathedral.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
DNA analysis,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
one of the hallmarks

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
of the scientific revolution

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
of the last 400 years that he started,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
was the way we found

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
which set of bones

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
actually belonged to the person

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
who read all those astronomical books

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which were filled with leftover hair

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that was Copernicus' hair --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
obviously not many other people

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
bothered to read these books later on.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
That match was unambiguous.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
The DNA matched,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and we know that this was indeed

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Nicolaus Copernicus.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Now, the connection between

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
biology and DNA

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and life

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
because, even back then,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
his followers

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
very quickly made the logical step

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
to ask: if the Earth is just a planet,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
then what about planets around other stars?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
about life on other planets?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
very popular books of the time.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And at the time,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
people actually answered that question

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
positively: "Yes."

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
But there was no evidence.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And here begins 400 years

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
many others --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
which never led to the answer

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
of those very basic questions

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
which humanity has asked all the time.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
"What is life? What is the origin of life?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Are we alone?"

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And that especially happened in the last 10 years,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
at the end of the 20th century,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
when the beautiful developments

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
due to molecular biology,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
understanding the code of life, DNA,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
all of that seemed to actually

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
put us, not closer,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
but further apart from answering

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
those basic questions.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Now, the good news.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
A lot has happened in the last few years,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and let's start with the planets.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Let's start with the old Copernican question:

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Are there earths around other stars?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And as we already heard,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
there is a way in which

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
we are trying, and now able,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to answer that question.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
It's a new telescope.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Our team, befittingly I think,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
named it after one of those dreamers

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
of the Copernican time,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Johannes Kepler,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and that telescope's sole purpose

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
is to go out,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
find the planets that orbit

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
other stars in our galaxy,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
happen to be out there.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
The telescope is actually

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
built similarly to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
except it does have an additional lens --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
a wide-field lens,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
as you would call it as a photographer.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And if, in the next couple of months,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
you walk out in the early evening

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and look straight up

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and place you palm like this,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
you will actually be looking at the field of the sky

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
where this telescope is searching for planets

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
day and night, without any interruption,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
for the next four years.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
The way we do that, actually,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is with a method, which we call the transit method.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
It's actually mini-eclipses that occur

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
when a planet passes in front of its star.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
for us to be able do that,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
but if you have a million stars,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
you'll find enough planets.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And as you see on this animation,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
what Kepler is going to detect

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
is just the dimming of the light from the star.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But we learn a lot from that:

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
How much of the light is being dimmed

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
depends on how big the planet is.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
We learn about its orbit,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the period of its orbit and so on.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So, what have we learned?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Well, let me try to walk you through

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
what we actually see

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and so you understand the news

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that I'm here to tell you today.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
What Kepler does

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
is discover a lot of candidates,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
which we then follow up and find as planets,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
confirm as planets.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It basically tells us

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
this is the distribution of planets in size.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So we count many, many such planets,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and they have different sizes.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
We do that in our solar system.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
In fact, even back during the ancients,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
the Solar System in that sense

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
would look on a diagram like this.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
even back to the time of Epicurus

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and then of course Copernicus

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and his followers.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Up until recently, that was the Solar System --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
four Earth-like planets with small radius,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
smaller than about two times the size of the Earth --

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and that was of course Mercury,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Venus, Mars,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and of course the Earth,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and then the two big, giant planets.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Then the Copernican Revolution

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
brought in telescopes,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and of course three more planets were discovered.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Now the total planet number

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
in our solar system was nine.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
The small planets dominated,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and there was a certain harmony to that,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
which actually Copernicus was very happy to note,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and Kepler was one of the big proponents of.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
But up until, literally, 15 years ago,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that was all we knew about planets.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And that's what the frustration was.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Finally, 15 years ago,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
the technology came to the point

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
where we could discover a planet around another star,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and we actually did pretty well.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
In the next 15 years,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
almost 500 planets

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Unfortunately, as you can see,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
there was a very different picture.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
There was of course an explanation for it:

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
We only see the big planets,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
so that's why most of those planets

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
are really in the category of "like Jupiter."

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
But you see, we haven't gone very far.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
We were still back where Copernicus was.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
We didn't have any evidence

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
whether planets like the Earth are out there.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And we do care about planets like the Earth

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
because by now we understood

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
that life as a chemical system

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
really needs a smaller planet

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
with water and with rocks

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and with a lot of complex chemistry

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
to originate, to emerge, to survive.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And we didn't have the evidence for that.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
of what the new telescope, Kepler,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
has been able to tell us in the last few weeks,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and, lo and behold,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
we are back to the harmony

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
You can see here,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
the small planets dominate the picture.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
The planets which are marked "like Earth,"

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
[are] definitely more than

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
any other planets that we see.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And now for the first time, we can say that.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
There is a lot more work we need to do with this.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Most of these are candidates.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
In the next few years we will confirm them.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
But the statistical result

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
is loud and clear.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And the statistical result is that

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
planets like our own Earth

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
are out there.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So the question is: what do we do next?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Well, first of all, we can study them

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
now that we know where they are.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And we can find those that we would call habitable,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
meaning that they have similar conditions

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
to the conditions

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
that we experience here on Earth

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So, we can even put a number

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
to how many of those planets

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
now do we expect our own

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Milky Way Galaxy harbors.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And the number, as you might expect,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
is pretty staggering.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
It's about 100 million such planets.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
That's great news. Why?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Because with our own little telescope,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
just in the next two years,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So that's great because then

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
we can go and study them --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
remotely, of course --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
with all the techniques that we already have

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
tested in the past five years.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
We can find what they're made of,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
We know and expect that we'll see that.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
That's great, but that is not the whole news.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
That's not why I'm here.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
is really the exciting part.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
The one that this step

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is enabling us to do is coming next.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And here comes biology --

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
biology, with its basic question,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
which still stands unanswered,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
which is essentially:

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
"If there is life on other planets,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And let me immediately tell you here,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
good life, human life.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I really mean life

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
on Earth, past and present,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
from microbes to us humans,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
in its rich molecular diversity,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
the way we now understand life on Earth

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions --

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and we call that, collectively, biochemistry,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
life as a chemical process,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
as a chemical phenomenon.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
So the question is:

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
is that chemical phenomenon universal,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
or is it something

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
which depends on the planet?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Is it like gravity,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
which is the same everywhere in the universe,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
wherever we find them?

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
We need to know what we are looking for

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
when we try to do that.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
but which we can try --

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
We don't need to go to space

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to answer that question.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And so, that's what we are trying to do.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And that's what many people now are trying to do.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
that we are trying to build as well.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So this is one example

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that I want to show you here.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
When we think of what is necessary

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
for the phenomenon that we call life,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
we think of compartmentalization,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
keeping the molecules which are important for life

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
in a membrane,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
isolated from the rest of the environment,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
but yet, in an environment in which

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
they actually could originate together.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And in one of our labs,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Jack Szostak's labs,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
it was a series of experiments

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
in the last four years

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that showed that the environments --

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
which are very common on planets,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
on certain types of planets like the Earth,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
where you have some liquid water and some clays --

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
you actually end up with

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
naturally available molecules

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
which spontaneously form bubbles.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
But those bubbles have membranes

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
very similar to the membrane of every cell

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
of every living thing on Earth looks like,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
like this.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And they really help molecules,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
stay inside, develop,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
change, divide

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and do some of the processes that we call life.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Now this is just an example

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
to tell you the pathway

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
in which we are trying to answer

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And in a sense, you can think of that work

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
that people are starting to do now around the world

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
as building a bridge,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
building a bridge from two sides of the river.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
On one hand, on the left bank of the river,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
are the people like me who study those planets

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and try to define the environments.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and there is not too much lab,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and there is not enough human time

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
to actually to do all the experiments.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
From the right bank of the river

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and we hope to meet in the middle one day.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
So why should you care about that?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Why am I trying to sell you

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
a half-built bridge?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Am I that charming?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Well, there are many reasons,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and you heard some of them

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
in the short talk today.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
This understanding of chemistry

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
actually can help us

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
with our daily lives.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
But there is something more profound here,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
something deeper.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
And that deeper, underlying point

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
is that science

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
is in the process of redefining life

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
as we know it.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And that is going to change

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
our worldview in a profound way --

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
not in a dissimilar way

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
as 400 years ago,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Copernicus' act did,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
by changing the way

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
we view space and time.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Now it's about something else,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
but it's equally profound.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And half the time,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
what's happened

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
is it's related this kind of

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
sense of insignificance

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
to humankind,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
to the Earth in a bigger space.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And the more we learn,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
the more that was reinforced.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
You've all learned that in school --

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
how small the Earth is

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
compared to the immense universe.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And the bigger the telescope,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
the bigger that universe becomes.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
This pixel is the Earth.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
It is the Earth as we know it.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
It is seen from, in this case,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
from outside the orbit of Saturn.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
But it's really tiny.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
We know that.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Let's think of life as that entire planet

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
because, in a sense, it is.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Life on Earth

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
is the size of the Earth.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And let's compare it to the rest of the world

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
in spatial terms.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
What if that

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Copernican insignificance

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
was actually all wrong?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Would that make us more responsible

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
for what is happening today?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Let's actually try that.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
So in space, the Earth is very small.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Can you imagine how small it is?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Let me try it.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Okay, let's say

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
this is the size

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
of the observable universe,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
with all the galaxies,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
with all the stars,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
okay, from here to here.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
Do you know what the size of life

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
in this necktie will be?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
It will be the size

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
of a single, small atom.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
It is unimaginably small.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
We can't imagine it.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I mean look, you can see the necktie,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
but you can't even imagine seeing

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
the size of a little, small atom.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
But that's not the whole story, you see.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
The universe and life

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
are both in space and time.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
If that was

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
the age of the universe,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
then this is the age of life on Earth.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Think about those oldest living things on Earth,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
but in a cosmic proportion.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
This is not insignificant.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
This is very significant.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So life might be insignificant in size,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
but it is not insignificant in time.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Life and the universe

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
compare to each other like a child and a parent,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
parent and offspring.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
So what does this tell us?

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
This tells us that

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
that insignificance paradigm

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
that we somehow got to learn

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
from the Copernican principle,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
it's all wrong.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
There is immense, powerful potential

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
in life in this universe --

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
especially now that we know

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
that places like the Earth are common.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
And that potential, that powerful potential,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
is also our potential,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
of you and me.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
And if we are to be stewards

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
of our planet Earth

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
and its biosphere,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
we'd better understand

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
the cosmic significance

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
and do something about it.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
And the good news is we can

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
actually, indeed do it.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
And let's do it.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Let's start this new revolution

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
at the tail end of the old one,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
with synthetic biology being

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
the way to transform

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
both our environment

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
and our future.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
and meet in the middle.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
(Applause)
