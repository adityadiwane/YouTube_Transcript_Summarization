00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
This is called Hooked on a Feeling:

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
but a very happy chimp up there.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
and cannot wish not to be so.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
We are wired to pursue happiness,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
So given that that's true,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
how good are we at increasing our happiness?

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Well, we certainly try.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
the 10 secrets,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
Now another way we try to increase our happiness

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
is we medicate ourselves.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
It was clean, efficient, there was no high,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
there was really no danger, it had no street value.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
In 1995,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
illegal drugs were a $400 billion business,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
representing eight percent of world trade,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
roughly the same as gas and oil.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
One problem that's happening now is,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
although the rates of happiness

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
are about as flat as the surface of the moon,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
depression and anxiety are rising.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
and more people are being found out.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
In the United States right now

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
there are more suicides than homicides.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
There is a rash of suicide in China.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
And the World Health Organization predicts

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
by the year 2020

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
that depression will be

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
the second largest cause of disability.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
Now the good news here

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
is that if you take surveys from around the world,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
we see that about three quarters of people

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
will say they are at least pretty happy.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
But this does not follow any of the usual trends.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
For example, these two show great growth in income,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
absolutely flat happiness curves.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
My field, the field of psychology,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
hasn't done a whole lot

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
that can never be met in reality.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
He said, "One feels inclined to say

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
that the intention that man should be happy

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
is not included in the plan of creation."

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
was really what Freud called ordinary misery.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
(Laughter)

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And Freud in part reflects

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
the anatomy of the human emotion system --

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
which is that we have both a positive and a negative system,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
and our negative system

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
is extremely sensitive.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
We also find that people are more averse to losing

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
than they are happy to gain.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
The formula for a happy marriage

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
is five positive remarks, or interactions,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
for every one negative.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
And that's how powerful the one negative is.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
I also put in here the stress response.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
We're wired for dangers that are immediate,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
that are physical, that are imminent,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
and so our body goes into an incredible reaction

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
where endogenous opioids come in.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
We have a system that is really ancient,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
and really there for physical danger.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
And so over time, this becomes a stress response,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
which has enormous effects on the body.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
Cortisol floods the brain;

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
it destroys hippocampal cells and memory,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
and can lead to all kinds of health problems.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
But unfortunately, we need this system in part.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
If we were only governed by pleasure

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
we would not survive.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
We really have two command posts.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Emotions are short-lived intense responses

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
to challenge and to opportunity.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that tune in, turn on, drop out

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
that change what we remember,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
what kind of decisions we make,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
and how we perceive things.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
We've come away from the Freudian gloom,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
and people are now actively studying this.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
And one of the key points in the science of happiness

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
is that happiness and unhappiness

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
are not endpoints of a single continuum.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
The Freudian model is really one continuum

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
that, as you get less miserable,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
you get happier.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
you get less miserable.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
because there isn't a sense of the other half --

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
what are the positive emotions.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And of course we know this intuitively,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
that happiness is not just the absence of misery.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
seeing these as two parallel systems.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
So that the body can both look for opportunity

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And they're sort of two reciprocal

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
and dynamically interacting systems.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
People have also wanted to deconstruct.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
We use this word "happy,"

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
and it's this very large umbrella of a term.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
And then three emotions for which there are no English words:

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.330
schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
a malicious pleasure;

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
are happiness in another's happiness.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
We don't seem to have a word for that.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
We are very sensitive to the negative,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
but it is in part offset by the fact

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
that we have a positivity.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
We're also born pleasure-seekers.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
Babies love the taste of sweet

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
and hate the taste of bitter.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
They like to look at beautiful faces

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
rather than plain faces.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
They like to listen to consonant melodies

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
instead of dissonant melodies.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
Babies really are born

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
with a lot of innate pleasures.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
There was once a statement made by a psychologist

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
is really just about the genes,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
That's nonsense.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes --

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
about 50 percent --

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
Let's just go into the brain for a moment,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
and see where does happiness

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
arise from in evolution.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
We have basically at least two systems here,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
and they both are very ancient.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
One is the reward system,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
and that's fed by the chemical dopamine.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
It goes to the nucleus accumbens,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
where decisions are made, high level.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
This was originally seen as a system

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
that was the pleasure system of the brain.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
In the 1950s,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
So they assumed

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
It turned out that it wasn't,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
that it really is a system of motivation,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
a system of wanting.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
It gives objects what's called incentive salience.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
It makes something look so attractive

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
that you just have to go after it.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
That's something different

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
from the system that is the pleasure system,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
which simply says, "I like this."

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
The pleasure system, as you see,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
is widely spread throughout the brain.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
Dopamine system, the wanting system,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
is much more centralized.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
And we see here the smile.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
to the zygomatic major.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
the orbicularis oculi.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
will show this particular kind of smile.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
Extroverts use it more than introverts.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
People who are relieved of depression

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
show it more after than before.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
you will look for this expression.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
Our pleasures are really ancient.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia --

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
that we have a response to the natural world

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
that's very profound.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
Very interesting studies

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
done on people recovering from surgery,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
who found that people who faced a brick wall

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
versus people who looked out on trees and nature,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
the people who looked out on the brick wall

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
were in the hospital longer, needed more medication,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
and had more medical complications.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
There is something very restorative about nature,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
and it's part of how we are tuned.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
Humans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
Here is a three-week-old baby.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
the baby will do the same.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
We are social beings from the beginning.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
And even studies of cooperation

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
show that cooperation between individuals

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
lights up reward centers of the brain.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
One problem that psychology has had

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity --

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
or the importance of the social brain

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
to humans who come into the world helpless

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
and need each other tremendously --

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
is that they focus instead on the self

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
and self-esteem, and not self-other.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
It's sort of "me," not "we."

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
that goes against our biology and nature,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and hasn't made us any happier at all.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
when they're absorbed in something out in the world,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
when they're with other people, when they're active,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
learning, having sex, whatever.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
They're not sitting in front of the mirror

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
trying to figure themselves out,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
or thinking about themselves.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
is if you look at computerized text analysis

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
of people who commit suicide,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
what you find there, and it's quite interesting,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
is use of the first person singular --

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
"I," "me," "my,"

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
not "we" and "us" --

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
and the letters are less hopeless

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
than they are really alone.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.330
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
There is a profound need to belong.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
they care that we replicate,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
that we pass our genes on.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
So for example we have three systems

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Romantic attraction,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
that gets into the desire system.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
There's attachment, which is oxytocin,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
and the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
So a person can be in a long term attachment,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
become romantically infatuated with someone else,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
and want to have sex with a third person.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
is in social status.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
We are very acutely aware of our social status

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.330
and always seek to further and increase it.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
and that's dominance.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
I seize command by physical prowess,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and I keep it by beating my chest,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
and you make submissive gestures.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and that is a prestige route,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
which is freely conferred.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
and we give that person status.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
as they are in the animal world.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
But it's not irrelevant.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
You see mental distress going up with lower income.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
So clearly there is some effect.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
But the effect is relatively small.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
And one of the problems with money is materialism.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
What happens when people pursue money too avidly,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
So we have here, this couple.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
So one of the things is that it really takes over.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
That whole dopamine-wanting system

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
that as people rise above their biological needs,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
as the world becomes safer

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met --

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.330
our biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied --

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
we can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.330
toward self-actualization or transcendence,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
and rise above the materialist.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
So to just quickly conclude with some brief data

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
that suggests this might be so.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
they felt their life and their whole values had changed.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
before the change,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
and much more post-materialist values after.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
to generosity and forgiveness.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
I end with a few quotes.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
"There is only one question:

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
How to love this world?"

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
do not blame it; blame yourself.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
Tell yourself that you are not poet enough

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
to call forth its riches."

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
"First, say to yourself what you would be.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Then do what you have to do."

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
Thank you.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.330
(Applause)
