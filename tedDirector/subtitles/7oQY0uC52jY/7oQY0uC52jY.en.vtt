00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.359
What do we know about the future?

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:17.424
Difficult question,
simple answer: nothing.

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:19.915
We cannot predict the future.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.554
We only can create a vision
of the future, how it might be,

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:27.887
a vision which reveals disruptive
ideas, which is inspiring,

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:30.173
and this is the most important reason

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.221
which breaks the chains
of common thinking.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.549
There are a lot of people

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:36.764
who created their own vision
about the future,

00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:39.955
for instance, this vision here
from the early 20th century.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.015
It says here that this
is the ocean plane of the future.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.628
It takes only one and a half days
to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.129
Today, we know that this future
vision didn't come true.

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.061
So this is our largest
airplane which we have,

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:56.860
the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:58.408
so a lot of people fit in there

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:00.929
and it's technically completely different

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.140
than the vision I've shown to you.

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:05.110
I'm working in a team with Airbus,

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:06.689
and we have created our vision

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:09.621
about a more sustainable
future of aviation.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.106
So sustainability is quite
important for us,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.880
which should incorporate social

00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:16.970
but as well as environmental
and economic values.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:19.876
So we have created a very
disruptive structure

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.484
which mimics the design
of bone, or a skeleton,

00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:25.209
which occurs in nature.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.519
So that's why it looks
maybe a little bit weird,

00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:31.287
especially to the people who deal
with structures in general.

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:33.750
But at least it's just a kind of artwork

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:38.940
to explore our ideas
about a different future.

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:41.092
What are the main customers of the future?

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:42.974
So, we have the old, we have the young,

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.672
we have the uprising power of women,

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.675
and there's one mega-trend
which affects all of us.

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:52.100
These are the future anthropometrics.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:55.592
So our children are getting
larger, but at the same time

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.094
we are growing into different directions.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:03.778
So what we need is space
inside the aircraft,

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:05.903
inside a very dense area.

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.641
These people have different needs.

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:11.199
So we see a clear need
of active health promotion,

00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:13.871
especially in the case of the old people.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:15.741
We want to be treated as individuals.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:21.234
We like to be productive
throughout the entire travel chain,

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:23.531
and what we are doing in the future is

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.711
we want to use the latest
man-machine interface,

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:31.082
and we want to integrate this
and show this in one product.

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:34.524
So we combined these needs
with technology's themes.

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:37.052
So for instance, we are asking ourselves,

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:39.265
how can we create more light?

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.861
How can we bring more natural
light into the airplane?

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:45.235
So this airplane has no
windows anymore, for example.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.968
What about the data
and communication software

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:49.641
which we need in the future?

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:52.542
My belief is that the airplane
of the future

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.675
will get its own consciousness.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.154
It will be more like a living organism

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:01.576
than just a collection
of very complex technology.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.698
This will be very different in the future.

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:05.267
It will communicate directly

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.147
with the passenger in its environment.

00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.314
And then we are talking
also about materials,

00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.234
synthetic biology, for example.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.949
And my belief is that we will get
more and more

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:19.651
new materials which we can
put into structure later on,

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.797
because structure is one of the key
issues in aircraft design.

00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:27.069
So let's compare the old
world with the new world.

00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:29.617
I just want to show you here
what we are doing today.

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:33.316
So this is a bracket of an A380
crew rest compartment.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.013
It takes a lot of weight,

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:38.164
and it follows the classical design rules.

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:41.815
This here is an equal bracket
for the same purpose.

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:43.964
It follows the design of bone.

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:46.484
The design process
is completely different.

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:49.205
At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.148
and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:54.415
So this technology, 3D
printing, and new design rules

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.154
really help us to reduce the weight,

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.602
which is the biggest issue
in aircraft design,

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:01.341
because it's directly linked
to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:03.161
Push this idea a little bit forward.

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:08.052
So how does nature build its
components and structures?

00:04:08.076 --> 00:04:11.093
So nature is very clever.
It puts all the information

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:14.290
into these small building
blocks, which we call DNA.

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:16.866
And nature builds large
skeletons out of it.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.360
So we see a bottom-up approach here,

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:22.525
because all the information,
as I said, are inside the DNA.

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.740
And this is combined
with a top-down approach,

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.837
because what we are doing
in our daily life

00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.942
is we train our muscles,
we train our skeleton,

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.942
and it's getting stronger.

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:34.777
And the same approach can be
applied to technology as well.

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:38.163
So our building block is carbon
nanotubes, for example,

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:42.429
to create a large, rivet-less
skeleton at the end of the day.

00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:45.483
How this looks in particular,
you can show it here.

00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:47.617
So imagine you have
carbon nanotubes growing

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.054
inside a 3D printer,

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:52.253
and they are embedded
inside a matrix of plastic,

00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:55.346
and follow the forces
which occur in your component.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.089
And you've got trillions of them.

00:04:57.113 --> 00:04:59.282
So you really align them to wood,

00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:02.451
and you take this wood and make
morphological optimization,

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:04.410
so you make structures, sub-structures,

00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:08.443
which allows you to transmit
electrical energy or data.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.515
And now we take this
material, combine this

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.958
with a top-down approach,

00:05:11.982 --> 00:05:15.510
and build bigger and bigger components.

00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:18.555
So how might the airplane
of the future look?

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:20.676
So we have very different
seats which adapt

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.462
to the shape of the future passenger,

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:24.173
with the different anthropometrics.

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:26.719
We have social areas inside the aircraft

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.479
which might turn into a place

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:31.679
where you can play virtual golf.

00:05:31.703 --> 00:05:34.142
And finally, this bionic structure,

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.303
which is covered by a transparent

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:40.167
biopolymer membrane,
will really change radically

00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:42.560
how we look at aircrafts in the future.

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:44.584
So as Jason Silva said,

00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:47.107
if we can imagine it, why not make it so?

00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.842
See you in the future. Thank you.

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:53.128
(Applause)
