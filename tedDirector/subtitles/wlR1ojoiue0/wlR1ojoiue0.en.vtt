00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.236
I've been living in rural East Africa
for about 10 years,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.440
and I want to share a field perspective
with you on global poverty.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.508
I believe that the greatest failure
of the human race

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:25.938
is the fact that we've left more than
one billion of our members behind.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:28.677
Hungry, extreme poverty:

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:31.989
these often seem like gigantic,
insurmountable problems,

00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:33.446
too big to solve.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.715
But as a field practitioner,

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.543
I believe these are actually
very solvable problems

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.008
if we just take the right strategies.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.505
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:47.013
and he taught us that if we lean
on the right levers,

00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:48.447
we can move the world.

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:52.675
In the fight against extreme poverty,
I believe there are three powerful levers

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.072
that we can lean on.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:57.098
This talk is all about those levers,
and why they make poverty

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.207
a winnable fight in our lifetimes.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:01.396
What is extreme poverty?

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:04.232
When I first moved to rural East Africa,

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:06.156
I stayed overnight with a farm family.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.729
They were wonderful people.

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:11.625
They invited me into their home.
We sang songs together

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:12.800
and ate a simple dinner.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.928
They gave me a blanket
to sleep on the floor.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.738
In the morning, however,
there was nothing to eat.

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.702
And then at lunchtime, I watched
with an increasingly sick feeling

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:26.133
as the eldest girl in the family
cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:30.907
For that meal, every child
drank one cup to survive.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.565
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.552
when they handed one of those cups to me,

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:38.048
and I knew I had to accept
their hospitality.

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:42.761
Children need food not only to survive
but also to grow physically and mentally.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.431
Every day they fail to eat,
they lose a little bit of their future.

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:49.996
Amongst the extreme poor,
one in three children

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.620
are permanently stunted
from a lifetime of not eating enough.

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:56.838
When that's combined
with poor access to health care,

00:01:56.862 --> 00:02:01.322
one in 10 extremely poor children
die before they reach age five.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.356
And only one quarter of children
complete high school

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.884
because they lack school fees.

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:11.680
Hunger and extreme poverty curb
human potential in every possible way.

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:17.061
We see ourselves as a thinking,
feeling and moral human race,

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:20.120
but until we solve these problems
for all of our members,

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:21.829
we fail that standard,

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.674
because every person
on this planet matters.

00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:26.490
This child matters.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.884
These children matter.

00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:31.442
This girl matters.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.898
You know, we see things like this,

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:35.499
and we're upset by them,

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:37.325
but they seem like such big problems.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.184
We don't know how
to take effective action.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:42.790
But remember our friend Archimedes.

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:45.900
Global poverty has powerful levers.

00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:47.513
It's a problem like any other.

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:50.469
I live and work in the field,
and as a practitioner,

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:53.296
I believe these are very
solvable problems.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.801
So for the next 10 minutes,

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:56.979
let's not be sad
about the state of the world.

00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:58.503
Let's engage our brains.

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:01.603
Let's engage our collective passion
for problem-solving

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:03.816
and figure out what those levers are.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:07.569
Lever number one: most
of the world's poor are farmers.

00:03:08.157 --> 00:03:10.220
Think about how extraordinary this is.

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:12.705
If this picture represents
the world's poor,

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.034
then more than half engage in farming
as a major source of income.

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:18.295
This gets me really excited.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.671
All of these people, one profession.

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:22.703
Think how powerful this is.

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:26.245
When farmers become more productive,
then more than half the world's poor

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.673
earn more money and climb out of poverty.

00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:29.917
And it gets better.

00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:32.196
The product of farming
is, of course, food.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.825
So when farmers become more productive,
they earn more food,

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.570
and they don't just help themselves,

00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:40.820
but they help to feed healthy communities
and thriving economies.

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:44.801
And when farmers become more productive,
they reduce environmental pressure.

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:47.725
We only have two ways
we can feed the world:

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.072
we can either make our existing farmland
a lot more productive,

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:54.376
or we can clear cut forest and savannah
to make more farmland,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.650
which would be environmentally disastrous.

00:03:57.688 --> 00:04:01.000
Farmers are basically
a really important leverage point.

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:03.429
When farmers become more productive,

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:06.064
they earn more income,
they climb out of poverty,

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:10.163
they feed their communities and they
reduce environmental land pressure.

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:12.832
Farmers stand at the center of the world.

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:16.006
And not a farmer like this one,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.625
but rather this lady.

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:20.211
Most of the farmers I know
are actually women.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.971
Look at the strength and the will
radiating from this woman.

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:26.207
She is physically strong, mentally tough,

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.662
and she will do whatever it takes
to earn a better life for her children.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.830
If we're going to put the future
of humanity in one person's hands,

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:34.667
then I'm really glad it's her.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:40.101
(Applause)

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.381
There's just one problem:

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:46.148
many smallholder farmers
lack access to basic tools and knowledge.

00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:50.436
Currently, they take a little bit
of saved food grain from the prior year,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.840
they plant it in the ground
and they till it with a manual hand hoe.

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:56.629
These are tools and techniques
that date to the Bronze Age,

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:59.591
and it's why many farmers
are still very poor.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:02.137
But good news, again.

00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.312
Lever number two:

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:07.702
humanity actually solved the problem
of agricultural poverty a century ago.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.472
Let me walk you through the three
most basic factors in farming.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:16.341
First, hybrid seed is created
when you cross two seeds together.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:19.169
If you naturally pollinate
a high-yielding variety

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:21.504
together with a drought-resistant variety,

00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:25.366
you get a hybrid that inherits
positive traits from both of its parents.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.087
Next, conventional fertilizer,
if used responsibly,

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:30.910
is environmentally sustainable.

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:34.427
If you micro-dose
just a pinch of fertilizer

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.535
to a plant that's taller than I am,

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.733
you unlock enormous yield gain.

00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:40.822
These are known as farm inputs.

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.841
Farm inputs need to be combined
with good practice.

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:47.959
When you space your seeds
and plant with massive amounts of compost,

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:50.536
farmers multiply their harvests.

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:53.522
These proven tools and practices
have more than tripled

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:56.594
agricultural productivity
in every major region of the world,

00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:59.391
moving mass numbers of people
out of poverty.

00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:03.267
We just haven't finished delivering
these things to everybody just yet,

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.032
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.647
So overall, this is amazing news.

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.227
Humanity actually solved
agricultural poverty a century ago,

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:12.884
in theory.

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:15.832
We just haven't delivered these things
to everybody just yet.

00:06:16.354 --> 00:06:18.741
In this century, the reason
that people remain poor

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:20.971
is because maybe they live
in remote places.

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:23.090
They lack access to these things.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:26.715
Therefore, ending poverty
is simply a matter

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:30.161
of delivering proven goods
and services to people.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.483
We don't need more genius types right now.

00:06:32.507 --> 00:06:36.956
The humble delivery guy is going
to end global poverty in our lifetime.

00:06:38.088 --> 00:06:39.576
So these are the three levers,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.253
and the most powerful lever
is simply delivery.

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:46.320
Wherever the world's companies,
governments and nonprofits

00:06:46.344 --> 00:06:49.043
set up delivery networks
for life-improving goods,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.541
we eliminate poverty.

00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:54.016
OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.330
but what about in practice?

00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:57.356
What do these delivery networks look like?

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:00.541
I want to share the concrete example
that I know best,

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:02.476
my organization, One Acre Fund.

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:04.560
We only serve the farmer,

00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:07.949
and our job is to provide her
with the tools that she needs to succeed.

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:11.238
We start off by delivering farm inputs
to really rural places.

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:13.528
Now, this may appear
initially very challenging,

00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:15.763
but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.

00:07:15.787 --> 00:07:18.847
We buy farm inputs with the combined power
of our farmer network,

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.190
and store it in 20 warehouses like this.

00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:25.614
Then, during input delivery,
we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks

00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:28.476
and send them out to where farmers
are waiting in the field.

00:07:28.953 --> 00:07:32.391
They then get their individual orders
and walk it home to their farms.

00:07:32.415 --> 00:07:34.882
It's kind of like Amazon
for rural farmers.

00:07:35.694 --> 00:07:40.512
Importantly, realistic delivery
also includes finance, a way to pay.

00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:44.989
Farmers pay us little by little over time,
covering most of our expenses.

00:07:45.587 --> 00:07:47.724
And then we surround
all that with training.

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.802
Our rural field officers
deliver practical, hands-on training

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.231
to farmers in the field

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:54.800
every two weeks.

00:07:55.496 --> 00:07:59.080
Wherever we deliver our services,
farmers use these tools

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.674
to climb out of poverty.

00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:03.617
This is a farmer
in our program, Consolata.

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:05.876
Look at the pride on her face.

00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:09.870
She has achieved a modest prosperity
that I believe is the human right

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:12.507
of every hardworking person on the planet.

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:18.166
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving
about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.857
(Applause)

00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:26.159
The key to doing this
is scalable delivery.

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.371
In any given area, we hire
a rural field officer

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:32.551
who delivers our services
to 200 farmers, on average,

00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:35.426
with more than 1,000 people
living in those families.

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:39.236
Today, we have 2,000
of these rural field officers

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.641
growing very quickly.

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:42.472
This is our delivery army,

00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:44.658
and we're just one organization.

00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:47.846
There are many companies,
governments and nonprofits

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.081
that have delivery armies just like this.

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:52.151
And I believe we stand at a moment in time

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:57.078
where collectively, we are capable of
delivering farm services to all farmers.

00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:59.532
Let me show you how possible this is.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.829
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:03.958
with a map of the United States for scale.

00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:07.370
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because
this is a huge delivery territory.

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:08.567
It's very challenging.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:12.901
But we analyzed every 50-mile
by 50-mile block on the continent,

00:09:13.292 --> 00:09:17.897
and we found that half of farmers
live in just these shaded regions.

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.597
That's a remarkably small area overall.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.504
If you were to lay these boxes
next to each other

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:26.164
within a map of the United States,

00:09:26.188 --> 00:09:28.453
they would only cover
the Eastern United States.

00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:32.526
You can order pizza
anywhere in this territory

00:09:32.832 --> 00:09:35.983
and it'll arrive to your house
hot, fresh and delicious.

00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:39.848
If America can deliver pizza
to an area of this size,

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:42.895
then Africa's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:45.942
can deliver farm services
to all of her farmers.

00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:47.249
This is possible.

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:51.748
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing
beyond just farming.

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.399
In every field of human development,

00:09:54.423 --> 00:09:58.252
humanity has already invented
effective tools to end poverty.

00:09:58.276 --> 00:09:59.687
We just need to deliver them.

00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:02.563
So again, in every area
of human development,

00:10:02.587 --> 00:10:05.989
super-smart people a long time ago
invented inexpensive,

00:10:06.013 --> 00:10:07.845
highly effective tools.

00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:09.801
Humanity is armed to the teeth

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:13.163
with simple, effective
solutions to poverty.

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:16.368
We just need to deliver these
to a pretty small area.

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:20.368
Again using the map
of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,

00:10:20.392 --> 00:10:23.866
remember that rural poverty is
concentrated in these blue shaded areas.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.324
Urban poverty is even more concentrated,
in these green little dots.

00:10:29.282 --> 00:10:31.798
Again, using a map
of the United States for scale,

00:10:32.317 --> 00:10:35.876
this is what I would call
a highly achievable delivery zone.

00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:38.508
In fact, for the first time
in human history,

00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:42.031
we have a vast amount of delivery
infrastructure available to us.

00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:44.779
The world's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:10:44.803 --> 00:10:47.026
have delivery armies
that are fully capable

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.433
of covering this relatively small area.

00:10:49.927 --> 00:10:52.052
We just lack the will.

00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:54.324
If we are willing,

00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:56.156
every one of us has a role to play.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.291
We first need more people to pursue
careers in human development,

00:11:01.315 --> 00:11:03.463
especially if you live
in a developing nation.

00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:06.973
We need more front line health workers,
teachers, farmer trainers,

00:11:06.997 --> 00:11:09.109
sales agents for life-improving goods.

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:12.109
These are the delivery people
that dedicate their careers

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:13.799
to improving the lives of others.

00:11:14.532 --> 00:11:16.485
But we also need a lot of support roles.

00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:20.582
These are roles available
at just my organization alone,

00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:22.096
and we're just one out of many.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.173
This may surprise you, but no matter
what your technical specialty,

00:11:26.197 --> 00:11:28.407
there is a role for you in this fight.

00:11:29.158 --> 00:11:32.505
And no matter how logistically possible
it is to end poverty,

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:34.424
we need a lot more resources.

00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:36.292
This is our number one constraint.

00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:40.187
For private investors, we need
a big expansion of venture capital,

00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:43.935
private equity, working capital,
available in emerging markets.

00:11:44.477 --> 00:11:47.586
But there are also limits
to what private business can accomplish.

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:51.579
Private businesses often struggle
to profitably serve the extreme poor,

00:11:51.897 --> 00:11:54.229
so philanthropy still has
a major role to play.

00:11:54.998 --> 00:11:57.551
Anybody can give,
but we need more leadership.

00:11:58.112 --> 00:12:00.059
We need more visionary philanthropists

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:03.995
and global leaders who will take
problems in human development

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:07.049
and lead humanity to wipe them
off the face of the planet.

00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:11.098
If you're interested in these ideas,
check out this website.

00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:12.830
We need more leaders.

00:12:14.174 --> 00:12:16.196
Humanity has put people on the moon.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.797
We've invented supercomputers
that fit into our pockets

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.877
and connect us with anybody on the planet.

00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:24.183
We've run marathons
at a five-minute mile pace.

00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:26.650
We are an exceptional people.

00:12:27.822 --> 00:12:30.948
But we've left more than one billion
of our members behind.

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:33.783
Until every girl like this one
has an opportunity

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.705
to earn her full human potential,

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.918
we have failed to become
a truly moral and just human race.

00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:43.272
Logistically speaking,
it's incredibly possible

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.896
to end extreme poverty.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.102
We just need to deliver
proven goods and services

00:12:48.126 --> 00:12:49.323
to everybody.

00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:53.389
If we have the will, every one of us
has a role to play.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.913
Let's deploy our time, our careers,

00:12:56.937 --> 00:12:58.188
our collective wealth.

00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:01.517
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty

00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:03.208
in this lifetime.

00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:05.122
Thank you.

00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:12.146
(Applause)
