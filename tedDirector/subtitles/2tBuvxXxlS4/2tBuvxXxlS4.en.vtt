00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.089
Ten years ago,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.897
I got a phone call that
changed my life.

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:22.849
At the time, I was 
cardiologist at UCLA,

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.286
specializing in cardiac 
imaging techniques.

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:31.815
The call came from a veterinarian
at the Los Angeles Zoo.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.469
An elderly female chimpanzee

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.292
had woken up with a facial droop

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.628
and the veterinarians were worried
that she'd had a stroke.

00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:43.653
They asked if I'd 
come to the zoo

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.601
and image the animal's heart

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.291
to look for a possible
cardiac cause.

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.929
Now, to be clear, North American
zoos are staffed

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.058
by highly qualified, 
board-certified veterinarians

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:01.727
who take outstanding 
care of their animal patients.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:05.813
But occasionally, they do reach into 
the human medical community,

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:10.414
particularly for some 
speciality consultation,

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:16.233
and I was one of the lucky physicians
who was invited in to help.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:22.736
I had a chance to rule out
a stroke in this chimpanzee

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:28.800
and make sure that this gorilla 
didn't have a torn aorta,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.587
evaluate this macaw
for a heart murmur,

00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:41.056
make sure that this California sea lion's
paricardium wasn't inflamed,

00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:45.314
and in this picture, I'm listening
to the heart of a lion

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:48.931
after a lifesaving, 
collaborative procedure

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.848
with veterinarians and physicians

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:56.165
where we drained 700 cc's of 
fluid from the sac

00:01:56.165 --> 00:02:00.569
in which this lion's 
heart was contained.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.382
And this procedure, which I have
done on many human patients,

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:14.733
was identical, with the exception
of that paw and that tail.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:21.124
Now most of the time, I was working
at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:26.158
discussing symptoms
and diagnoses and treatments

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:29.599
for my human patients,

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.677
but some of the time,
I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:38.122
with veterinarians, discussing 
symptoms and diagnoses and treatments

00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:40.748
for their animal patients.

00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:45.841
And occasionally, on 
the very same day,

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:49.620
I went on rounds at 
UCLA Medical Center

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.523
and at the Los Angeles Zoo.

00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:58.861
And here's what started coming
into very clear focus for me.

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:03.167
Physicians and veterinarians
were essentially taking care

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:08.337
of the same disorders in their 
animal and human patients:

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:12.850
congestive heart failure, brain tumors,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.101
leukemia, diabetes, 
arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:26.241
even psychiatric syndromes
like depression, anxiety,

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:32.788
compulsions, eating disorders
and self-injury.

00:03:32.788 --> 00:03:35.666
Now, I've got a confession to make.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:42.515
Even though I studied comparative
physiology and evolutionary biology

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.598
as an undergrad --

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:49.136
I had even written my senior 
thesis on Darwinian theory --

00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:51.856
learning about the 
significant overlap

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.592
between the disorders of 
animals and humans,

00:03:54.592 --> 00:04:00.311
it came as a much needed 
wake-up call for me.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.799
So I started wondering,
with all of these overlaps,

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.317
how was it that I had never
thought to ask a veterinarian,

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.844
or consult the veterinary literature,

00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:17.173
for insights into one 
of my human patients?

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:23.324
Why had I never, nor had any of my 
physician friends and colleagues

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:28.667
whom I asked, ever attended 
a veterinary conference?

00:04:30.327 --> 00:04:36.443
For that matter, why was 
any of this a surprise?

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:42.588
I mean, look, every single physician
accepts some biological connection

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.488
between animals and humans.

00:04:45.488 --> 00:04:50.257
Every medication that we prescribe
or that we've taken ourselves

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.891
or we've given to our families

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:56.471
has first been tested on an animal.

00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.227
But there's something very different

00:04:58.227 --> 00:05:04.832
about giving an animal a 
medication or a human disease

00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:08.777
and the animal developing 
congestive heart failure

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:15.324
or diabetes or breast cancer 
on their own.

00:05:15.324 --> 00:05:17.955
Now, maybe some of the surprise

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:21.539
comes from the increasing
separation in our world

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.423
between the urban and the nonurban.

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:28.121
You know, we hear about these city kids

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.192
who think that wool grows on trees

00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:36.256
or that cheese comes from a plant.

00:05:36.256 --> 00:05:38.989
Well, today's human hospitals,

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:45.800
increasingly, are turning into these
gleaming cathedrals of technology.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.717
And this creates a psychological
distance between the human patients

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.437
who are being treated there

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:57.934
and animal patients who
are living in oceans

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:01.452
and farms and jungles.

00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:06.561
But I think there's an 
even deeper reason.

00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:13.294
Physicians and scientists, we accept
intellectually that our species,

00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:17.035
Homo sapiens, is merely 
one species,

00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:22.506
no more unique or
special than any other.

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:27.522
But in our hearts, we don't 
completely believe that.

00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:32.866
I feel it myself when I'm 
listening to Mozart

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:38.266
or looking at pictures of the 
Mars Rover on my MacBook.

00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:43.812
I feel that tug of 
human exceptionalism,

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:48.370
even as I recognize the 
scientifically isolating cost

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.746
of seeing ourselves as a
superior species, apart.

00:06:54.746 --> 00:06:57.979
Well, I'm trying these days.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.441
When I see a human patient
now, I always ask,

00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:07.283
what do the animal doctors know
about this problem that I don't know?

00:07:07.283 --> 00:07:12.745
And, might I be taking better 
care of my human patient

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:17.918
if I saw them as a human
animal patient?

00:07:19.858 --> 00:07:24.095
Here are a few examples of the 
kind of exciting connections

00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:28.057
that this kind of 
thinking has led me to.

00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:30.894
Fear-induced heart failure.

00:07:30.894 --> 00:07:33.398
Around the year 2000,

00:07:33.398 --> 00:07:40.898
human cardiologists "discovered"
emotionally induced heart failure.

00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:46.000
It was described in a gambling father 
who had lost his life's savings

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.152
with a roll of the dice,

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:53.823
in a bride who'd
been left at the alter.

00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:58.464
But it turns out, this 
"new" human diagnosis

00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:02.939
was neither new, nor
was it uniquely human.

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:08.867
Veterinarians had been diagnosing, 
treating and even preventing

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:12.746
emotionally induced
symptoms in animals

00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:18.650
ranging from monkeys to flamingos,
from to deer to rabbits,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.708
since the 1970s.

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:26.334
How many human lives 
might have been saved

00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:29.939
if this veterinary knowledge
had been put into the hands

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:33.845
of E.R. docs and cardiologists?

00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:37.517
Self-injury.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:41.652
Some human patients 
harm themselves.

00:08:41.652 --> 00:08:45.352
Some pluck out patches of hair,

00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:48.452
others actually cut themselves.

00:08:50.242 --> 00:08:54.064
Some animal patients 
also harm themselves.

00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:57.544
There are birds that 
pluck out feathers.

00:08:57.544 --> 00:09:05.313
There are stallions that repetitively
bite their flanks until they bleed.

00:09:05.313 --> 00:09:10.485
But veterinarians have very specific
and very effective ways

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:14.904
of treating and even
preventing self-injury

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:18.686
in their self-injuring animals.

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:21.733
Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge
be put into the hands

00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:25.459
of psychotherapists and 
parents and patients

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:28.437
struggling with self-injury?

00:09:29.497 --> 00:09:34.332
Postpartum depression and 
postpartum psychosis.

00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:37.467
Sometimes, soon after giving birth,

00:09:37.467 --> 00:09:39.891
some women become depressed,

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:44.197
and sometimes they become seriously 
depressed and even psychotic.

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:46.761
They may neglect their newborn,

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:48.937
and in some extreme cases,

00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:52.086
even harm the child.

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:56.312
Equine veterinarians also
know that occasionally,

00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:59.433
a mare, soon after giving birth,

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.646
will neglect the foal,
refusing to nurse,

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:07.718
and in some instances,
kick the foal, even to death.

00:10:09.018 --> 00:10:11.823
But veterinarians have devised

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:17.296
an intervention to deal with
this foal rejection syndrome

00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:21.561
that involves increasing 
oxytocin in the mare.

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.946
Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,

00:10:24.946 --> 00:10:27.635
and this leads to renewed interest,

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:31.065
on the part of the mare, in her foal.

00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:33.121
Shouldn't this information

00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:36.461
be put into the hands of ob/gyn's

00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:39.794
and family doctors and patients

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:45.156
who are struggling with postpartum
depression and psychosis?

00:10:47.306 --> 00:10:49.653
Well, despite all of this promise,

00:10:49.653 --> 00:10:57.461
unfortunately the gulf between
our fields remains large.

00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:02.990
To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going 
to have to air some dirty laundry.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.095
Some physicians can be real snobs

00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:09.649
about doctors who are not M.D.'s.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:15.975
I'm talking about dentists and 
optometrists and psychologists,

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:20.202
but maybe especially animal doctors.

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:24.075
Of course, most physicians
don't realize that it is harder

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:28.458
to get into vet school these
days than medical school,

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:30.742
and that when we go 
to medical school,

00:11:30.742 --> 00:11:33.355
we learn everything 
there is to know

00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:36.478
about one species, Homo sapiens,

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.785
but veterinarians need to learn
about health and disease

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:45.763
in mammals, amphibians,
reptiles, fish and birds.

00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:50.447
So I don't blame the vets
for feeling annoyed

00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:56.412
by my profession's
condescension and ignorance.

00:11:56.412 --> 00:11:59.152
But here's one from the vets:

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:02.559
What do you call a veterinarian

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:08.416
who can only take 
care of one species?

00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:11.737
A physician. (Laughter)

00:12:11.737 --> 00:12:17.946
Closing the gap has become 
a passion for me,

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.547
and I'm doing this 
through programs

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:23.689
like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,

00:12:23.689 --> 00:12:29.236
where we're bringing animal experts 
and evolutionary biologists

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:33.388
and embedding them
on our medical teams

00:12:33.388 --> 00:12:37.326
with our interns and our residents.

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:41.033
And through Zoobiquity conferences,

00:12:41.033 --> 00:12:45.252
where we bring medical schools 
together with veterinary schools

00:12:45.252 --> 00:12:47.392
for collabortive discussions

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.193
of the shared diseases and disorders

00:12:50.193 --> 00:12:54.319
of animal and human patients.

00:12:54.319 --> 00:12:57.162
At Zoobiquity conferences,

00:12:57.162 --> 00:13:02.582
participants learn how treating
breast cancer in a tiger

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:05.535
can help us better treat breast cancer

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.846
in a kindergarten teacher;

00:13:08.846 --> 00:13:13.709
how understanding polycystic
overies in a Holstein cow

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.943
can help us better take care

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:20.503
of a dance instructor 
with painful periods;

00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:25.152
and how better understanding the 
treatment of separation anxiety

00:13:25.152 --> 00:13:27.561
in a high-strung Sheltie

00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:34.962
can help an anxious young child
struggling with his first days of school.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:40.207
In the United States and now 
internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences

00:13:40.207 --> 00:13:47.076
physicians and veterinarians check 
their attitudes and their preconceptions

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:53.100
at the door and come 
together as colleagues,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.965
as peers, as doctors.

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:04.385
After all, we humans 
are animals, too,

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.845
and it's time for us physicians to embrace

00:14:07.845 --> 00:14:12.392
our patients' and our own animal natures

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:14.530
and join veterinarians

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.518
in a species-spanning approach to health.

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:21.731
Because it turns out,

00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:26.929
some of the best and 
most humanistic medicine

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:32.469
is being practiced by doctors
whose patients aren't human.

00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:35.851
And one of the best ways 
we can take care

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:40.952
of the human patient is by 
paying close attention

00:14:40.952 --> 00:14:44.655
to how all the other 
patients on the planet

00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:51.312
live, grow, get sick and heal.

00:14:51.312 --> 00:14:53.897
Thank you.

00:14:53.897 --> 00:14:56.377
(Applause).
