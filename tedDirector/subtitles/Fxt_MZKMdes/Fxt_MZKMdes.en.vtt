00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:14.808
I am failing as a woman,

00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:17.127
I am failing as a feminist.

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:20.229
I have passionate opinions
about gender equality,

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:24.290
but I worry that to freely accept
the label of "feminist,"

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:26.613
would not be fair to good feminists.

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:29.557
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.445
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.802
Or at least, I wrote an essay,

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.001
and then I wrote a book
called "Bad Feminist,"

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:40.461
and then in interviews, people started
calling me The Bad Feminist.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:41.651
(Laughter)

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.712
So, what started as a bit
of an inside joke with myself

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:47.417
and a willful provocation,

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.091
has become a thing.

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.456
Let me take a step back.

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:53.312
When I was younger,

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.249
mostly in my teens and 20s,

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:57.678
I had strange ideas about feminists

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:01.478
as hairy, angry, man-hating,
sex-hating women --

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:03.081
as if those are bad things.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.834
(Laughter)

00:01:06.978 --> 00:01:10.416
These days, I look at how
women are treated the world over,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.726
and anger, in particular, seems
like a perfectly reasonable response.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.495
But back then,

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.322
I worried about the tone people used

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:21.322
when suggesting I might be a feminist.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:23.880
The feminist label was an accusation,

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:26.293
it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.658
I was labeled a woman
who doesn't play by the rules,

00:01:29.682 --> 00:01:31.303
who expects too much,

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:33.320
who thinks far too highly of myself,

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:37.458
by daring to believe I'm equal --
(Coughs) -- superior to a man.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.885
You don't want to be that rebel woman,

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.394
until you realize that you
very much are that woman,

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.915
and cannot imagine being anyone else.

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:47.364
As I got older, I began to accept

00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:50.721
that I am, indeed, a feminist,
and a proud one.

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:53.539
I hold certain truths to be self-evident:

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:56.015
Women are equal to men.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.820
We deserve equal pay for equal work.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:01.828
We have the right to move
through the world as we choose,

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:03.819
free from harassment or violence.

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:07.787
We have the right to easy,
affordable access to birth control,

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:09.708
and reproductive services.

00:02:09.732 --> 00:02:12.303
We have the right to make choices
about our bodies,

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:16.480
free from legislative oversight
or evangelical doctrine.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:17.988
We have the right to respect.

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:19.885
There's more.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.124
When we talk about the needs of women,

00:02:22.148 --> 00:02:25.553
we have to consider
the other identities we inhabit.

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:27.034
We are not just women.

00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:29.365
We are people with different bodies,

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.404
gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:35.319
class backgrounds, abilities,
and so much more.

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:37.105
We need to take into account

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.565
these differences and how they affect us,

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.291
as much as we account for
what we have in common.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.299
Without this kind of inclusion,
our feminism is nothing.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.871
I hold these truths to be self-evident,
but let me be clear:

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.032
I'm a mess.

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.313
I am full of contradictions.

00:02:54.337 --> 00:02:57.257
There are many ways in which
I'm doing feminism wrong.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.392
I have another confession.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:03.752
When I drive to work, I listen
to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:05.283
(Laughter)

00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:07.636
Even though the lyrics
are degrading to women --

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.455
these lyrics offend me to my core --

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.479
the classic Yin Yang Twins
song "Salt Shaker" --

00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:14.955
it is amazing.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.445
(Laughter)

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.397
"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.

00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:24.181
Bitch, you gotta shake it
'til your camel starts to hurt!"

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:25.363
(Laughter)

00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:26.412
Think about it.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.324
(Laughter)

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:30.666
Poetry, right?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.350
I am utterly mortified
by my music choices.

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:36.286
(Laughter)

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.594
I firmly believe in man work,

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.027
which is anything I don't
want to do, including --

00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.932
(Laughter) --

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.110
all domestic tasks,

00:03:45.134 --> 00:03:49.443
but also: bug killing, trash removal,
lawn care and vehicle maintenance.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:51.881
I want no part of any of that.

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:52.978
(Laughter)

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.899
Pink is my favorite color.

00:03:54.923 --> 00:03:57.951
I enjoy fashion magazines
and pretty things.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:00.278
I watch "The Bachelor"
and romantic comedies,

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:03.409
and I have absurd fantasies
about fairy tales coming true.

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:06.445
Some of my transgressions
are more flagrant.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.280
If a woman wants to take
her husband's name,

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:11.992
that is her choice, and it is not
my place to judge.

00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:15.598
If a woman chooses to stay home
to raise her children,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.713
I embrace that choice, too.

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:21.808
The problem is not that she makes herself
economically vulnerable in that choice;

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:24.002
the problem is that our society is set up

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:26.982
to make women economically vulnerable
when they choose.

00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:28.632
Let's deal with that.

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:32.979
(Applause)

00:04:35.413 --> 00:04:37.484
I reject the mainstream feminism

00:04:37.508 --> 00:04:40.135
that has historically ignored
or deflected the needs

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.547
of women of color, working-class women,
queer women and transgender women,

00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:47.944
in favor of supporting white, middle-
and upper-class straight women.

00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:51.624
Listen, if that's good feminism --
I am a very bad feminist.

00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:52.738
(Laughter)

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:54.214
There is also this:

00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:56.960
As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.

00:04:56.984 --> 00:05:00.653
We have this tendency to put
visible feminists on a pedestal.

00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:02.740
We expect them to pose perfectly.

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:04.447
When they disappoint us,

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.933
we gleefully knock them
from the very pedestal we put them on.

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:09.992
Like I said, I am a mess --

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.846
consider me knocked off that pedestal

00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:13.867
before you ever try to put me up there.

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:14.935
(Laughter)

00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:16.434
Too many women,

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:19.483
particularly groundbreaking women
and industry leaders,

00:05:19.507 --> 00:05:21.845
are afraid to be labeled as feminists.

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:25.575
They're afraid to stand up and say,
"Yes, I am a feminist,"

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.844
for fear of what that label means,

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:31.736
for fear of being unable to live up to
unrealistic expectations.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.341
Take, for example, BeyoncÃ©,
or as I call her, The Goddess.

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:38.301
(Laughter)

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:41.757
She has emerged, in recent years,
as a visible feminist.

00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:44.598
At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:48.388
she performed in front of the word
"feminist" 10 feet high.

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.643
It was a glorious spectacle to see

00:05:50.643 --> 00:05:53.643
this pop star openly embracing feminism

00:05:53.643 --> 00:05:55.372
and letting young women and men know

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:58.499
that being a feminist
is something to celebrate.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.644
As the moment faded, cultural critics
began endlessly debating

00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:05.328
whether or not BeyoncÃ© was,
indeed, a feminist.

00:06:05.693 --> 00:06:07.574
They graded her feminism,

00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:11.866
instead of simply taking a grown,
accomplished woman at her word.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.528
(Laughter)

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.226
(Applause)

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.767
We demand perfection from feminists,

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.148
because we are still fighting for so much,

00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:23.469
we want so much,

00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:25.026
we need so damn much.

00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:28.575
We go far beyond reasonable,
constructive criticism,

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.348
to dissecting any given woman's feminism,

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.753
tearing it apart
until there's nothing left.

00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:35.642
We do not need to do that.

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:40.559
Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive
feminism -- is a starting point.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.036
But what happens next?

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:46.074
We go from acknowledging
our imperfections to accountability,

00:06:46.098 --> 00:06:49.200
or walking the walk,
and being a little bit brave.

00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:52.192
If I listen to degrading music,

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:55.742
I am creating a demand for which
artists are more than happy

00:06:55.742 --> 00:06:57.676
to contribute a limitless supply.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000
These artists are not going to change

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.955
how they talk about women in their songs

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.616
until we demand that change
by affecting their bottom line.

00:07:05.998 --> 00:07:08.125
Certainly, it is difficult.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.124
Why must it be so catchy?

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.317
(Laughter)

00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.320
It's hard to make the better choice,

00:07:16.344 --> 00:07:19.140
and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.202
But --

00:07:20.226 --> 00:07:21.981
when I justify bad choices,

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:24.924
I make it harder for women
to achieve equality,

00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:26.812
the equality that we all deserve,

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:28.153
and I need to own that.

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:31.802
I think of my nieces, ages three and four.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.265
They are gorgeous
and headstrong, brilliant girls,

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:35.863
who are a whole lot of brave.

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:39.201
I want them to thrive in a world
where they are valued

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.553
for the powerful creatures they are.

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:42.632
I think of them,

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:46.315
and suddenly, the better choice
becomes far easier to make.

00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:48.865
We can all make better choices.

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:51.830
We can change the channel
when a television show

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.524
treats sexual violence
against women like sport,

00:07:54.548 --> 00:07:55.976
Game of Thrones.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.810
We can change the radio station

00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:01.039
when we hear songs
that treat women as nothing.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.746
We can spend our
box office dollars elsewhere

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.320
when movies don't treat women

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.743
as anything more than decorative objects.

00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:09.984
We can stop supporting professional sports

00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:13.258
where the athletes treat 
their partners like punching bags.

00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:17.649
(Applause)

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:22.542
In other ways, men --
and especially straight white men --

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:25.653
can say, "No, I will not publish
with your magazine,

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:28.963
or participate in your project,
or otherwise work with you,

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:31.384
until you include a fair number of women,

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:33.955
both as participants and decision makers.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.797
I won't work with you
until your publication,

00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:40.582
or your organization, is more inclusive
of all kinds of difference."

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:43.518
Those of us who are underrepresented

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:45.711
and invited to participate
in such projects,

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:48.104
can also decline to be included

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:51.131
until more of us are invited
through the glass ceiling,

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.107
and we are tokens no more.

00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:55.227
Without these efforts,

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:57.053
without taking these stands,

00:08:57.077 --> 00:08:59.659
our accomplishments
are going to mean very little.

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:02.978
We can commit these small acts of bravery

00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:06.905
and hope that our choices trickle
upward to the people in power --

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.540
editors, movie and music producers,

00:09:09.564 --> 00:09:11.937
CEOs, lawmakers --

00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:14.174
the people who can make
bigger, braver choices

00:09:14.198 --> 00:09:16.979
to create lasting, meaningful change.

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:20.201
We can also boldly claim our feminism --

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:22.590
good, bad, or anywhere in between.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.781
The last line of my book
"Bad Feminist" says,

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:29.724
"I would rather be a bad feminist
than no feminist at all."

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.280
This is true for so many reasons,

00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:35.864
but first and foremost, I say this
because once upon a time,

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:37.717
my voice was stolen from me,

00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.666
and feminism helped me
to get my voice back.

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:42.605
There was an incident.

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:46.335
I call it an incident so I can carry
the burden of what happened.

00:09:46.724 --> 00:09:48.136
Some boys broke me,

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:49.950
when I was so young, I did not know

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.400
what boys can do to break a girl.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.542
They treated me like I was nothing.

00:09:54.566 --> 00:09:57.040
I began to believe I was nothing.

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:59.103
They stole my voice, and in the after,

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:00.484
I did not dare to believe

00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:02.924
that anything I might say could matter.

00:10:02.948 --> 00:10:03.957
But --

00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:05.353
I had writing.

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:07.813
And there, I wrote myself back together.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:11.256
I wrote myself toward a stronger
version of myself.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.004
I read the words of women

00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:15.360
who might understand a story like mine,

00:10:15.384 --> 00:10:17.155
and women who looked like me,

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:21.279
and understood what it was like to move
through the world with brown skin.

00:10:21.303 --> 00:10:25.578
I read the words of women
who showed me I was not nothing.

00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:27.284
I learned to write like them,

00:10:27.308 --> 00:10:29.490
and then I learned to write as myself.

00:10:29.856 --> 00:10:31.000
I found my voice again,

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:35.080
and I started to believe that my voice
is powerful beyond measure.

00:10:36.048 --> 00:10:37.586
Through writing and feminism,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.364
I also found that if I was
a little bit brave,

00:10:40.388 --> 00:10:43.989
another woman might hear me
and see me and recognize

00:10:44.013 --> 00:10:47.604
that none of us are the nothing
the world tries to tell us we are.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.668
In one hand,

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:52.716
I hold the power to accomplish anything.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.741
And in my other,

00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:57.449
I hold the humbling reality
that I am just one woman.

00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.597
I am a bad feminist,

00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:01.263
I am a good woman,

00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:03.662
I am trying to become better
in how I think,

00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:05.946
and what I say, and what I do,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.755
without abandoning everything
that makes me human.

00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:11.676
I hope that we can all do the same.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.943
I hope that we can all be
a little bit brave,

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:16.054
when we most need such bravery.

00:11:16.856 --> 00:11:19.537
(Applause)
