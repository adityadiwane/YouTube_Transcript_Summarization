00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:23.669
You might think there are
many things that I can't do

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:25.604
because I cannot see.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.974
That's largely true.

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:30.481
Actually, I just needed
to have a bit of help

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.339
to come up to the stage.

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:35.291
But there is also a lot that I can do.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.142
This is me rock climbing
for the first time.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:43.243
Actually, I love sports
and I can play many sports,

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:48.649
like swimming, skiing, skating,
scuba diving, running and so on.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.293
But there is one limitation:

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:53.904
somebody needs to help me.

00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:56.626
I want to be independent.

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.444
I lost my sight at the age of 14
in a swimming pool accident.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.613
I was an active, independent teenager,

00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:08.053
and suddenly I became blind.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.904
The hardest thing for me
was losing my independence.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.007
Things that until then seemed simple
became almost impossible to do alone.

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:23.703
For example, one of my
challenges was textbooks.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.834
Back then, there were no
personal computers,

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:29.295
no Internet, no smartphones.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.752
So I had to ask one of my two brothers
to read me textbooks,

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:38.252
and I had to create
my own books in Braille.

00:01:38.653 --> 00:01:40.006
Can you imagine?

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:43.722
Of course, my brothers
were not happy about it,

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:47.569
and later, I noticed they were not there
whenever I needed them.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:48.594
(Laughter)

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:52.410
I think they tried to stay away from me.

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:53.788
I don't blame them.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.352
I really wanted to be freed
from relying on someone.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.069
That became my strong desire
to ignite innovation.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.786
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.556
I got to know cutting-edge technologies

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.677
and I thought to myself,

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:15.320
how come there is no computer technology

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.470
to create books in Braille?

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:22.652
These amazing technologies
must be able to also help people

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:25.075
with limitations like myself.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.617
That's the moment
my innovation journey began.

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:34.540
I started developing
digital book technologies,

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:39.857
such as a digital Braille editor,
digital Braille dictionary

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.627
and a digital Braille library network.

00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:47.546
Today, every student who is visually
impaired can read textbooks,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.397
by using personal computers
and mobile devices,

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.506
in Braille or in voice.

00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:56.134
This may not surprise you,

00:02:56.158 --> 00:03:01.218
since everyone now has digital books
in their tablets in 2015.

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:07.089
But Braille went digital
many years before digital books,

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:12.345
already in the late 1980s,
almost 30 years ago.

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:17.041
Strong and specific needs
of the blind people

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:22.708
made this opportunity to create
digital books way back then.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:28.349
And this is actually not
the first time this happened,

00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:34.463
because history shows us
accessibility ignites innovation.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:39.484
The telephone was invented
while developing a communication tool

00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:41.375
for hearing impaired people.

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:47.157
Some keyboards were also invented
to help people with disabilities.

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:52.284
Now I'm going to give you
another example from my own life.

00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:56.951
In the '90s, people around me
started talking about the Internet

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.418
and web browsing.

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:01.767
I remember the first time
I went on the web.

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:03.736
I was astonished.

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:08.459
I could access newspapers
at any time and every day.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.666
I could even search
for any information by myself.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:18.989
I desperately wanted to help the blind
people have access to the Internet,

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:24.319
and I found ways to render the web
into synthesized voice,

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:28.113
which dramatically simplified
the user interface.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:34.095
This led me to develop
the Home Page Reader in 1997,

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:39.012
first in Japanese and later,
translated into 11 languages.

00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:42.361
When I developed the Home Page Reader,

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.314
I got many comments from users.

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.435
One that I strongly remember said,

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:54.280
"For me, the Internet
is a small window to the world."

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:58.126
It was a revolutionary moment
for the blind.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.307
The cyber world became accessible,

00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:06.001
and this technology that we created
for the blind has many uses,

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:08.000
way beyond what I imagined.

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.685
It can help drivers listen to their emails

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:16.982
or it can help you listen
to a recipe while cooking.

00:05:18.116 --> 00:05:20.626
Today, I am more independent,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.966
but it is still not enough.

00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:29.523
For example, when I approached
the stage just now, I needed assistance.

00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:33.833
My goal is to come up here independently.

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:35.674
And not just here.

00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:41.810
My goal is to be able to travel
and do things that are simple to you.

00:05:42.638 --> 00:05:45.447
OK, now let me show you
the latest technologies.

00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:48.995
This is a smartphone app
that we are working on.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:54.259
(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet
to the door, and keep straight.

00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:00.825
EV: Take the two doors to go out.
The door is on your right.

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.669
EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:10.898
Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!

00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:11.923
(Laughter)

00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:14.090
CA: Where are you going?
You look so happy.

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:16.227
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper
just got accepted.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.898
CA: That's great! Congratulations.

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:21.573
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know
it was me, and that I look happy?

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:22.947
(Chieko and Nick laugh)

00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.130
Man: Hi.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:25.871
(Laughter)

00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:27.046
CA: Oh ... hi.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.387
EV: He is not talking to you,
but on his phone.

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:37.616
EV: Potato chips.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.762
EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.

00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:51.676
EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday;
take apple instead of chocolate.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.866
(Laughter)

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.768
EV: Approaching.

00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:01.214
EV: You arrived.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:04.178
CA: Now ...

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:08.130
(Applause)

00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:09.345
Thank you.

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:12.267
So now the app navigates me

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:16.307
by analyzing beacon signals
and smartphone sensors

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:21.467
and permits me to move around
indoor and outdoor environments

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.079
all by myself.

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:27.951
But the computer vision part
that showed who is approaching,

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:31.481
in which mood -- we are still
working on that part.

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:38.657
And recognizing facial expressions
is very important for me to be social.

00:07:39.398 --> 00:07:45.564
So now the fusions of technologies
are ready to help me

00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:47.268
see the real world.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.149
We call this cognitive assistance.

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:55.140
It understands our surrounding world

00:07:55.164 --> 00:08:01.381
and whispers to me in voice
or sends a vibration to my fingers.

00:08:02.088 --> 00:08:08.152
Cognitive assistance will augment
missing or weakened abilities --

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:10.807
in other words, our five senses.

00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:14.775
This technology is only in an early stage,

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:19.576
but eventually, I'll be able to find
a classroom on campus,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.354
enjoy window shopping

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:25.239
or find a nice restaurant
while walking along a street.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:30.715
It will be amazing if I can find you
on the street before you notice me.

00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:35.382
It will become my best buddy, and yours.

00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:39.898
So, this really is a great challenge.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:44.364
It is a challenge
that needs collaboration,

00:08:44.388 --> 00:08:47.290
which is why we are creating
an open community

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:50.173
to accelerate research activities.

00:08:51.192 --> 00:08:56.090
Just this morning, we announced
the open-source fundamental technologies

00:08:56.114 --> 00:08:57.741
you just saw in the video.

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:01.251
The frontier is the real world.

00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:06.291
The blind community is exploring
this technical frontier

00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:08.021
and the pathfinder.

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:12.297
I hope to work with you
to explore the new era,

00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:15.408
and the next time that I'm on this stage,

00:09:15.432 --> 00:09:17.846
through technology and innovation,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.895
I will be able to walk up here

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.515
all by myself.

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:22.778
Thank you so much.

00:09:22.802 --> 00:09:28.420
(Applause)
