00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:20.317
The most massive

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:25.252
tsunami perfect storm

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:29.131
is bearing down upon us.

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.377
This perfect storm

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:37.545
is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:42.495
and we are facing that reality

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:43.876
with the full belief

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.432
that we can solve our problems with technology,

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:48.728
and that's very understandable.

00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:52.935
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:56.445
is the result of our rising population,

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:59.249
rising towards 10 billion people,

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.893
land that is turning to desert,

00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:05.001
and, of course, climate change.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.662
Now there's no question about it at all:

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:09.473
we will only solve the problem

00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:12.985
of replacing fossil fuels with technology.

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:16.113
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --

00:01:16.113 --> 00:01:18.234
are by no means the only thing

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:22.352
that is causing climate change.

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.235
Desertification

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:29.561
is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.862
and this happens only when

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.871
we create too much bare ground.

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.877
There's no other cause.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.895
And I intend to focus

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:42.801
on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:48.094
But I have for you a very simple message

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:52.290
that offers more hope than you can imagine.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.358
We have environments

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:57.602
where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:00.106
On those, it is almost impossible

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:02.895
to create vast areas of bare ground.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:06.517
No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:08.264
And we have environments

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.957
where we have months of humidity

00:02:10.957 --> 00:02:12.735
followed by months of dryness,

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:16.213
and that is where desertification is occurring.

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:18.269
Fortunately, with space technology now,

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.946
we can look at it from space,

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:24.210
and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.833
Generally, what you see in green

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.688
is not desertifying,

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:29.994
and what you see in brown is,

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:34.366
and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:39.151
About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.075
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.779
while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.491
Think of it in terms of drums of water,

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:51.163
each containing 200 liters.

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:55.763
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:58.637
of that land that day.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.021
The next day, the land looked like this.

00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:03.844
Where had that water gone?

00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:06.241
Some of it ran off as flooding,

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:09.188
but most of the water that soaked into the soil

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.469
simply evaporated out again,

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.838
exactly as it does in your garden

00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:16.853
if you leave the soil uncovered.

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:20.319
Now, because the fate of water and carbon

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.877
are tied to soil organic matter,

00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:27.804
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:30.630
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.735
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.735
that desertification is only occurring

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:41.384
in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:45.359
and that tall grasslands like this one

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.991
in high rainfall are of no consequence.

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:53.568
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.279
you find that most of the soil in that grassland

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.570
that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.688
leading to increased runoff and evaporation.

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:07.674
That is the cancer of desertification

00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:12.210
that we do not recognize till its terminal form.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.522
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:20.306
mostly cattle, sheep and goats,

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:23.123
overgrazing the plants,

00:04:23.123 --> 00:04:27.242
leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.

00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:29.482
Almost everybody knows this,

00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:32.317
from nobel laureates to golf caddies,

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:34.948
or was taught it, as I was.

00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:38.418
Now, the environments like you see here,

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:41.282
dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:44.202
and I loved wildlife,

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:47.594
and so I grew up hating livestock

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:49.622
because of the damage they were doing.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.906
And then my university education as an ecologist

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:55.994
reinforced my beliefs.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:05:01.270
Well, I have news for you.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.554
We were once just as certain

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.834
that the world was flat.

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:10.779
We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.954
And I want to invite you now

00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:19.208
to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:21.779
When I was a young man,

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.674
a young biologist in Africa,

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:29.091
I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:31.610
as future national parks.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.037
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:38.205
and no sooner did we remove the hunting,

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:41.686
drum-beating people to protect the animals,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.579
than the land began to deteriorate,

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:47.825
as you see in this park that we formed.

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:50.148
Now, no livestock were involved,

00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:53.780
but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.045
I did the research and I proved we had too many,

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:01.629
and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.681
and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.

00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:09.465
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:12.324
and it was political dynamite, frankly.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:15.449
So our government formed a team of experts

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.090
to evaluate my research.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.497
They did. They agreed with me,

00:06:20.497 --> 00:06:22.408
and over the following years,

00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:28.299
we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:32.039
And it got worse, not better.

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.538
Loving elephants as I do,

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.144
that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,

00:06:38.144 --> 00:06:40.872
and I will carry that to my grave.

00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:43.344
One good thing did come out of it.

00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:46.720
It made me absolutely determined

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.200
to devote my life to finding solutions.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.285
When I came to the United States, I got a shock,

00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:58.753
to find national parks like this one

00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:02.984
desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.

00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:04.988
And there'd been no livestock on this land

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:07.712
for over 70 years.

00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:09.638
And I found that American scientists

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.552
had no explanation for this

00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:15.512
except that it is arid and natural.

00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:18.872
So I then began looking

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:22.123
at all the research plots I could

00:07:22.123 --> 00:07:24.826
over the whole of the Western United States

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:27.027
where cattle had been removed

00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:29.899
to prove that it would stop desertification,

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.732
but I found the opposite,

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:34.554
as we see on this research station,

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:38.278
where this grassland that was green in 1961,

00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:43.291
by 2002 had changed to that situation.

00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:48.010
And the authors of the position paper on climate change

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.563
from which I obtained these pictures

00:07:50.563 --> 00:07:56.382
attribute this change to "unknown processes."

00:07:56.382 --> 00:08:00.376
Clearly, we have never understood

00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:03.060
what is causing desertification,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.108
which has destroyed many civilizations

00:08:06.108 --> 00:08:08.800
and now threatens us globally.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.253
We have never understood it.

00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:13.372
Take one square meter of soil

00:08:13.372 --> 00:08:16.075
and make it bare like this is down here,

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:19.254
and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn

00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:22.058
and much hotter at midday

00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:25.728
than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,

00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:27.342
plant litter.

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:30.379
You have changed the microclimate.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:32.478
Now, by the time you are doing that

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:38.066
and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground

00:08:38.066 --> 00:08:42.091
on more than half the world's land,

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:45.321
you are changing macroclimate.

00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.910
But we have just simply not understood

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.896
why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:54.546
Why has it accelerated lately?

00:08:54.546 --> 00:08:56.513
We had no understanding of that.

00:08:56.513 --> 00:08:59.938
What we had failed to understand

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:03.761
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,

00:09:03.761 --> 00:09:06.657
the soil and the vegetation

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:12.449
developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:15.073
and that these grazing animals

00:09:15.073 --> 00:09:20.465
developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:24.357
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators

00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:26.698
is to get into herds,

00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:30.690
and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.521
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,

00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:38.521
and they have to keep moving,

00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:40.438
and it was that movement

00:09:40.438 --> 00:09:43.242
that prevented the overgrazing of plants,

00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:45.641
while the periodic trampling

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:48.161
ensured good cover of the soil,

00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:51.273
as we see where a herd has passed.

00:09:51.273 --> 00:09:57.501
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.

00:09:57.501 --> 00:10:00.293
It has just come through four months of rain,

00:10:00.293 --> 00:10:03.975
and it's now going into eight months of dry season.

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:07.443
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.

00:10:07.443 --> 00:10:10.519
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:14.267
has to decay biologically

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:17.791
before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,

00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:21.984
the grassland and the soil begin to die.

00:10:21.984 --> 00:10:25.179
Now, if it does not decay biologically,

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:30.318
it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,

00:10:30.318 --> 00:10:33.273
and this smothers and kills grasses,

00:10:33.273 --> 00:10:36.382
leading to a shift to woody vegetation

00:10:36.382 --> 00:10:39.802
and bare soil, releasing carbon.

00:10:39.802 --> 00:10:44.906
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.

00:10:44.906 --> 00:10:50.755
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:53.146
and worse than that,

00:10:53.146 --> 00:10:55.826
burning one hectare of grassland

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:58.986
gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants

00:10:58.986 --> 00:11:01.900
than 6,000 cars.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.293
And we are burning in Africa, every single year,

00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:10.932
more than one billion hectares of grasslands,

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:14.558
and almost nobody is talking about it.

00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:18.897
We justify the burning, as scientists,

00:11:18.897 --> 00:11:21.810
because it does remove the dead material

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.113
and it allows the plants to grow.

00:11:25.113 --> 00:11:28.209
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:30.905
what could we do to keep that healthy?

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:33.929
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:38.617
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more

00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:42.233
without causing desertification and climate change.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:45.370
We cannot burn it without causing

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.635
desertification and climate change.

00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:51.620
What are we going to do?

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.070
There is only one option,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.931
I'll repeat to you, only one option

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.650
left to climatologists and scientists,

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.578
and that is to do the unthinkable,

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:07.314
and to use livestock,

00:12:07.314 --> 00:12:10.269
bunched and moving,

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:13.658
as a proxy for former herds and predators,

00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:15.402
and mimic nature.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:19.906
There is no other alternative left to mankind.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.354
So let's do that.

00:12:22.354 --> 00:12:25.724
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.962
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,

00:12:28.962 --> 00:12:31.786
and we've done so, and look at that.

00:12:31.786 --> 00:12:35.146
All of that grass is now covering the soil

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:39.116
as dung, urine and litter or mulch,

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:42.396
as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:46.757
and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,

00:12:46.757 --> 00:12:51.764
to store carbon, and to break down methane.

00:12:51.764 --> 00:12:53.994
And we did that,

00:12:53.994 --> 00:12:56.764
without using fire to damage the soil,

00:12:56.764 --> 00:12:59.900
and the plants are free to grow.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.164
When I first realized

00:13:02.164 --> 00:13:04.646
that we had no option as scientists

00:13:04.646 --> 00:13:07.406
but to use much-vilified livestock

00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:12.653
to address climate change and desertification,

00:13:12.653 --> 00:13:14.888
I was faced with a real dilemma.

00:13:14.888 --> 00:13:16.613
How were we to do it?

00:13:16.613 --> 00:13:21.177
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists

00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:23.125
bunching and moving their animals,

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:26.792
but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:30.671
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,

00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:33.930
and that had accelerated desertification,

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.103
as we first discovered in Africa

00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:38.767
and then confirmed in the United States,

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:40.886
and as you see in this picture

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:44.247
of land managed by the federal government.

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:46.148
Clearly more was needed

00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:48.237
than bunching and moving the animals,

00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:51.807
and humans, over thousands of years,

00:13:51.807 --> 00:13:56.193
had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.

00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:58.577
But we biologists and ecologists

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:01.546
had never tackled anything as complex as this.

00:14:01.546 --> 00:14:04.185
So rather than reinvent the wheel,

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:08.321
I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.

00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:10.793
And I found there were planning techniques

00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:14.565
that I could take and adapt to our biological need,

00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:17.262
and from those I developed what we call

00:14:17.262 --> 00:14:20.572
holistic management and planned grazing,

00:14:20.572 --> 00:14:22.371
a planning process,

00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:26.066
and that does address all of nature's complexity

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:31.315
and our social, environmental, economic complexity.

00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:33.979
Today, we have young women like this one

00:14:33.979 --> 00:14:36.347
teaching villages in Africa

00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:39.283
how to put their animals together into larger herds,

00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:41.987
plan their grazing to mimic nature,

00:14:41.987 --> 00:14:46.028
and where we have them hold their animals overnight --

00:14:46.028 --> 00:14:48.287
we run them in a predator-friendly manner,

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:50.609
because we have a lot of lands, and so on --

00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:52.803
and where they do this and hold them overnight

00:14:52.803 --> 00:14:54.608
to prepare the crop fields,

00:14:54.608 --> 00:14:58.592
we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.

00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:00.209
Let's look at some results.

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:04.433
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:07.977
It has just come through four months of very good rains

00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:11.487
it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.

00:15:11.487 --> 00:15:14.522
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,

00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:17.629
has evaporated from the soil surface.

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:21.431
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,

00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:24.951
and we have 150,000 people

00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:28.701
on almost permanent food aid.

00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:33.197
Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,

00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:36.037
with the same rainfall, and look at that.

00:15:36.037 --> 00:15:38.742
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.

00:15:38.742 --> 00:15:41.229
It's fine.

00:15:41.229 --> 00:15:46.547
The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,

00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:49.403
everything is now more productive,

00:15:49.403 --> 00:15:53.508
and we have virtually no fear of dry years.

00:15:53.508 --> 00:15:59.003
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats

00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:00.928
400 percent,

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:04.058
planning the grazing to mimic nature

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:06.479
and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,

00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:10.066
giraffe and other animals that we have.

00:16:10.066 --> 00:16:15.788
But before we began, our land looked like that.

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:21.205
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years

00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:23.974
regardless of what rain we got.

00:16:23.974 --> 00:16:27.592
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:31.245
as we use livestock to mimic nature.

00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:32.707
This was another site

00:16:32.707 --> 00:16:35.085
where it had been bare and eroding,

00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:37.789
and at the base of the marked small tree,

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:42.077
we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?

00:16:42.077 --> 00:16:43.686
And again, watch the change

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:46.536
just using livestock to mimic nature.

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:48.667
And there are fallen trees in there now,

00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:53.624
because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.

00:16:53.624 --> 00:16:57.280
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.234
and I've had to mark the hill

00:16:59.234 --> 00:17:03.421
because the change is so profound.

00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:09.146
(Applause)

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:15.918
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:18.886
turn the desert that you see on the right there

00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:20.820
back to grassland,

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.342
and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land

00:17:24.342 --> 00:17:26.185
with hope for the future.

00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:28.982
And look at the amazing change in this one,

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:31.694
where that gully has completely healed

00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:36.273
using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,

00:17:36.273 --> 00:17:40.498
and once more, we have the third generation of that family

00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:43.778
on that land with their flag still flying.

00:17:43.778 --> 00:17:46.346
The vast grasslands of Patagonia

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:48.422
are turning to desert as you see here.

00:17:48.422 --> 00:17:51.482
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,

00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:55.126
and he has documented the steady decline of that land

00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:58.602
over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.

00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:03.450
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.399
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:11.742
and they have documented a 50-percent increase

00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:15.210
in the production of the land in the first year.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.250
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.706
pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature

00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:25.202
and openly saying it is the only hope they have

00:18:25.202 --> 00:18:28.370
of saving their families and saving their culture.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.446
Ninety-five percent of that land

00:18:30.446 --> 00:18:34.106
can only feed people from animals.

00:18:34.106 --> 00:18:36.217
I remind you that I am talking about

00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:40.658
most of the world's land here that controls our fate,

00:18:40.658 --> 00:18:43.714
including the most violent region of the world,

00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:46.666
where only animals can feed people

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:49.970
from about 95 percent of the land.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:55.104
What we are doing globally is causing climate change

00:18:55.104 --> 00:18:58.400
as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.936
and maybe more than fossil fuels.

00:19:01.936 --> 00:19:05.611
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.608
violence, social breakdown and war,

00:19:08.608 --> 00:19:11.016
and as I am talking to you,

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:14.166
millions of men, women and children

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:16.568
are suffering and dying.

00:19:16.568 --> 00:19:19.280
And if this continues,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.074
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,

00:19:23.074 --> 00:19:28.121
even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.

00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:32.357
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature

00:19:32.357 --> 00:19:34.813
at very low cost

00:19:34.813 --> 00:19:37.309
to reverse all this.

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.741
We are already doing so

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:43.737
on about 15 million hectares

00:19:43.737 --> 00:19:46.369
on five continents,

00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:47.996
and people who understand

00:19:47.996 --> 00:19:50.286
far more about carbon than I do

00:19:50.286 --> 00:19:53.344
calculate that, for illustrative purposes,

00:19:53.344 --> 00:19:56.138
if we do what I am showing you here,

00:19:56.138 --> 00:20:00.163
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere

00:20:00.163 --> 00:20:03.497
and safely store it in the grassland soils

00:20:03.497 --> 00:20:05.123
for thousands of years,

00:20:05.123 --> 00:20:10.119
and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.473
that I've shown you,

00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:15.173
we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:16.814
while feeding people.

00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:19.586
I can think of almost nothing

00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:23.111
that offers more hope for our planet,

00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:25.359
for your children,

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:28.015
and their children, and all of humanity.

00:20:28.015 --> 00:20:31.320
Thank you.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:39.432
(Applause)

00:20:39.432 --> 00:20:44.420
Thank you. (Applause)

00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.501
Thank you, Chris.

00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:57.847
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,

00:20:57.847 --> 00:20:59.944
and I'm sure everyone here has,

00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:03.672
A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:05.431
I'm just going to ask you one quick question.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:09.115
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,

00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:12.491
it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?

00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:13.482
How do you start?

00:21:13.482 --> 00:21:15.121
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,

00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:18.739
and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed

00:21:18.739 --> 00:21:20.508
is during mine reclamation,

00:21:20.508 --> 00:21:22.822
where it's 100 percent bare.

00:21:22.822 --> 00:21:27.178
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:30.272
where I offered a £5 note

00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:32.291
in a hundred-mile drive

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.411
if somebody could find one grass

00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:36.401
in a hundred-mile drive,

00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:39.187
and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,

00:21:39.187 --> 00:21:42.963
the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,

00:21:42.963 --> 00:21:45.619
just by the movement, mimicking nature,

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:50.394
and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.

00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:52.865
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.

00:21:52.865 --> 00:21:56.577
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.

00:21:56.577 --> 00:21:58.569
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you

00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:01.201
and try and -- I want to get more on this

00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:04.153
that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.

00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:07.689
CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,

00:22:07.689 --> 00:22:10.465
and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.

00:22:10.465 --> 00:22:13.457
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.687
(Applause)
