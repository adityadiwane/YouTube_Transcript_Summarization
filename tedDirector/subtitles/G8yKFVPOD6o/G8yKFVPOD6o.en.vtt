Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
William Kamkwamba: Thanks.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
WK: This is my home. This is where I live.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
CA: Where? What country?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
WK: I wanted to make a windmill.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
CA: A windmill?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
WK: Yeah.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
WK: Yeah.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I get information about doing the mill.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I tried, and I made it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Applause)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
WK: Ah, no. I just --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
CA: What happened?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it has got four -- ah -- three blades,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and mine has got four blades.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
CA: The book had three, yours had four.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
WK: Yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
CA: And you made it out of what?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
CA: OK.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WK: Yeah.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
WK: Yeah. I test.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What materials did you use?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
WK: Yeah. The windmill.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
CA: How much electricity?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
WK: 12 watts.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
WK: Four bulbs and two radios.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
CA: Wow.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
WK: Yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000
(Applause) CA: Next slide --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so who's that?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
what did they make of this? They were impressed?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WK: Yeah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WK: Um --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to pump water and irrigation for crops.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
CA: So this one would have to be bigger?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
WK: Yeah.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
CA: How big?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
WK: Yeah.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to get people who might be able to help in some way

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to realize this dream?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
CA: And as you think of your life going forward,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
you're 19 now,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Thank you so much for coming.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
WK: Thank you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
(Applause)
