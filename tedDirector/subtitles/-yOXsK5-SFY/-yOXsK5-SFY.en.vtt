00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.607
(Music)

00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:39.662
(Music ends)

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:46.675
(Applause)

00:08:57.463 --> 00:08:58.464
(Applause ends)

00:08:58.488 --> 00:09:00.548
Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.

00:09:00.572 --> 00:09:02.731
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.

00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:06.332
(Audience cheers)

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:10.482
(Applause)

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:15.076
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.284
(Laughter)

00:09:17.308 --> 00:09:22.610
I mean, what does this have to do
with technology, entertainment and design?

00:09:23.784 --> 00:09:28.135
Well, I count my iPod,
cellphone and computer as technology,

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:31.088
but this has nothing to do with that.

00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:34.008
So I did a little research on it.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.318
Well, this is what I found.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.377
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.

00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:39.405
(Clears throat)

00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:42.892
The violin is made of a wood box
and four metal strings.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.751
By pulling a string, it vibrates
and produces a sound wave,

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:48.323
which passes through
a piece of wood called a bridge,

00:09:48.347 --> 00:09:51.838
and goes down to the wood box
and gets amplified, but ... let me think.

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:55.172
(Laughter)

00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:58.475
Placing your finger
at different places on the fingerboard

00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:02.088
changes the string length, and that
changes the frequency of the sound wave.

00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:03.487
(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!

00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.866
(Laughter)

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.497
OK, this is sort of technology,

00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:13.016
but I can call it
a 16th-century technology.

00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:17.413
But actually, the most
fascinating thing that I found

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:21.672
was that even the audio system
or wave transmission nowadays

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:26.976
are still based on the same principle
of producing and projecting sound.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.161
Isn't that cool?

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:31.976
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.327
(Applause)

00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:41.834
Design -- I love its design.

00:10:41.858 --> 00:10:44.650
I remember when I was little,
my mom asked me,

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:46.976
"Would you like to play
the violin or the piano?"

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.232
I looked at that giant monster
and said to myself --

00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:56.409
"I am not going to lock myself
on that bench the whole day!"

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:57.543
(Laughter)

00:10:57.567 --> 00:10:59.373
This is small and lightweight.

00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.856
I can play from standing,
sitting or walking.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.292
And, you know what?

00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:07.976
The best of all is that
if I don't want to practice,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.816
(Whispering) I can hide it.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.165
(Laughter)

00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:15.817
The violin is very beautiful.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.530
Some people relate it
as the shape of a lady.

00:11:19.094 --> 00:11:23.820
But whether you like it or not,
it's been so for more than 400 years,

00:11:23.844 --> 00:11:27.573
unlike modern stuff
[that] easily looks dated.

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:30.097
But I think it's very personal
and unique that,

00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.659
although each violin looks pretty similar,

00:11:32.683 --> 00:11:35.105
no two violins sound the same --

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.545
even from the same maker
or based on the same model.

00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:43.033
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.

00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:47.944
But actually, the instrument itself
isn't very entertaining.

00:11:48.563 --> 00:11:52.312
I mean, when I first got my violin
and tried to play around on it,

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.664
it was actually really bad,

00:11:55.688 --> 00:11:59.675
because it didn't sound the way
I'd heard from other kids --

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:02.165
it was so horrible and so scratchy.

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.538
So, it wasn't entertaining at all.

00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:11.239
But besides, my brother
found this very funny:

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.630
Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!

00:12:13.654 --> 00:12:19.976
(Laughter)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.794
A few years later, I heard a joke

00:12:21.818 --> 00:12:24.143
about the greatest violinist,
Jascha Heifetz.

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:25.814
After Mr. Heifetz's concert,

00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:27.847
a lady came over and complimented him:

00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.005
"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin
sounded so great tonight!"

00:12:31.577 --> 00:12:33.976
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.869
so he picked up his violin and said,

00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:37.588
"Funny -- I don't hear anything."

00:12:37.612 --> 00:12:40.301
(Laughter)

00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:43.292
Now I realize that as the musician,

00:12:43.316 --> 00:12:48.699
we human beings, with our great mind,
artistic heart and skill,

00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:53.580
can change this 16th-century technology
and a legendary design

00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:55.516
to a wonderful entertainment.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.605
Now I know why I'm here.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:05.316
(Music)

00:16:31.946 --> 00:16:33.946
(Music ends)

00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:42.871
(Applause)

00:16:44.315 --> 00:16:47.420
At first, I thought I was just
going to be here to perform,

00:16:47.444 --> 00:16:51.507
but unexpectedly, I learned
and enjoyed much more.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:58.723
But ... although some of the talks
were quite up there for me.

00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:01.983
(Laughter)

00:17:02.007 --> 00:17:05.498
Like the multi-dimension stuff.

00:17:06.322 --> 00:17:08.844
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough

00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:11.976
if I could actually get
my two dimensions correct in school.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.092
(Laughter)

00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:19.786
But actually, the most
impressive thing to me is that --

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.586
well, actually, I would also like
to say this for all children

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:29.516
is to say thank you to all adults,
for actually caring for us a lot,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.746
and to make our future world much better.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.921
Thank you.

00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:40.866
(Applause)

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:47.667
(Music)

00:22:30.376 --> 00:22:32.725
(Music ends)

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:39.886
(Applause)

00:22:57.885 --> 00:22:59.885
(Applause ends)

00:23:00.306 --> 00:23:04.888
(Music)

00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:42.938
(Music ends)

00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:49.000
(Applause)
