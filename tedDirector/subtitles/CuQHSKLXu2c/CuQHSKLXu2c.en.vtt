00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
that I was just in the process of completing,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
about some of the controversies that that book inspired.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
The book is called "The Blank Slate,"

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
based on the popular idea

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
that the human mind is a blank slate,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and that all of its structure comes from

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
socialization, culture, parenting, experience.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Here are a few quotes indicating that:

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
"Man has no nature," from the historian

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Jose Ortega y Gasset;

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
"Man has no instincts," from the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
anthropologist Ashley Montagu;

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
is a blank slate,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
and some of them just come from common sense.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
As many people have told me over the years,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
anyone who's had more than one child

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
knows that kids come into the world

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
with certain temperaments and talents;

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
it doesn't all come from the outside.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Oh, and anyone who

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
has both a child and a house pet

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
will acquire a human language,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
whereas the house pet won't,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
presumably because of some innate different between them.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
And anyone who's ever been

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
in a heterosexual relationship knows that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
There are also, I think,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
increasing results from

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
the scientific study of humans

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
that, indeed, we're not born blank slates.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
One of them, from anthropology,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
is the study of human universals.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
kind of an occupational

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
pleasure of anthropologists to show

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
how exotic other cultures can be,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
and that there are places out there where, supposedly,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
everything is the opposite to the way it is here.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
But if you instead

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
look at what is common to the world's cultures,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
you find that there is an enormously rich set

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
of behaviors and emotions

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
and ways of construing the world

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and they range from aesthetics,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
affection and age statuses

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
attempts to control, the color white

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
and a worldview.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
Also, genetics and neuroscience

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
are increasingly showing that the brain

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
is intricately structured.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
and his colleagues in which they --

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
using MRI --

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
measured the distribution of gray matter --

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
that is, the outer layer of the cortex --

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
in a large sample of pairs of people.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
They coded correlations in the thickness

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
of gray matter in different parts of the brain

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
using a false color scheme, in which

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
no difference is coded as purple,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and any color other than purple indicates

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
a statistically significant correlation.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
By definition, two people picked at random

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
can't have correlations in the distribution

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
of gray matter in the cortex.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
This is what happens in people who share

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
are not purple, showing that if one person

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
has a thicker bit of cortex

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
in that region, so does his fraternal twin.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
And here's what happens if you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
get a pair of people who share all their DNA --

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
namely, clones or identical twins.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Now, these aren't just

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
differences in anatomy,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
like the shape of your ear lobes,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
but they have consequences in thought and behavior

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.330
"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
As you can see, there are two inventors

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
in the waiting room of a patent attorney.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
studies of identical twins who were separated at birth

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
and then tested in adulthood

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
show that they have astonishing similarities.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
And this happens in every pair of identical twins

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
separated at birth ever studied --

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
My favorite example is a pair of twins,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
one of whom was brought up

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.330
both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
and both of them liked to surprise people

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.330
by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
Now --

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
the story might seem to good to be true,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
but when you administer

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
batteries of psychological tests,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
you get the same results -- namely,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
identical twins separated at birth show

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
quite astonishing similarities.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Now, given both the common sense

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
and scientific data

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
why should it have been such an appealing notion?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
The foremost is that if we're blank slates,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
then, by definition, we are equal,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
because zero equals zero equals zero.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
But if something is written on the slate,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
then some people could have more of it than others,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
and according to this line of thinking, that would justify

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
discrimination and inequality.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
Another political fear of human nature

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
is that if we are blank slates,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
we can perfect mankind --

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
through social engineering.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
then perhaps some of them might condemn us

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
to selfishness, prejudice and violence.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
And just to make a long story short:

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
first of all, the concept of fairness

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
is not the same as the concept of sameness.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
in the Declaration of Independence,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
that all men are created equal,"

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
that all men are clones."

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
and that every person ought to be treated

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
as an individual, and not prejudged

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
by the statistics of particular groups

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
that they may belong to.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
Also, even if we were born

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
with certain ignoble motives,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
That is because the human mind

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
is a complex system with many parts,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
and some of them can inhibit others.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
For example, there's excellent reason to believe

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
to profit from the lessons of history.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
So even if people did have impulses

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
towards selfishness or greed,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
that's not the only thing in the skull,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
In the book, I

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
go over controversies such as this one,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and a number of other hot buttons,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
including the arts, cloning, crime,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
free will, education, evolution,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
gender differences, God, homosexuality,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
Nazism, parenting, politics,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
race, rape, religion, resource depletion,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
social engineering, technological risk and war.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
And needless to say, there were certain risks

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
in taking on these subjects.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
When I wrote a first draft of the book,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
and here are some of

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
the reactions that I got:

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
"Better get a security camera for your house."

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
or positions in scholarly societies."

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
in your author bio."

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
"Do you have tenure?"

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
(Laughter)

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
Well, the book came out in October,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
and nothing terrible has happened.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
I -- I like --

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
There was indeed reason to be nervous,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
and there were moments in which I did feel nervous,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
knowing the history

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
of what has happened to people

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
who've taken controversial stands

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
or discovered disquieting findings

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
in the behavioral sciences.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
of people who have been slandered, called Nazis,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
for stumbling across or arguing

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
about controversial findings.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And you never know when you're going to

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
come across one of these booby traps.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
My favorite example is a pair of psychologists

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
who did research on left-handers,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
and have a shorter lifespan.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
It's not clear, by the way, since then,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
whether that is an accurate generalization,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
but the data at the time seemed to support that.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
Well, pretty soon they were barraged

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
with enraged letters,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
death threats,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
coming from irate left-handers

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
and their advocates,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
and they were literally afraid to open their mail

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
because of the venom and vituperation

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
that they had inadvertently inspired.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Well,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
the night is young, but the book has been out

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
for half a year,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
and nothing terrible has happened.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
None of the dire professional consequences

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
has taken place --

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.330
I haven't been

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
exiled from the city of Cambridge.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
But what I wanted to talk about

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.330
are two of these hot buttons

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
that have aroused the strongest response

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
in the 80-odd reviews

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
that The Blank Slate has received.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
and see if you can guess which two

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
inspired probably 90 percent

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
of the reaction in the various reviews

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
and radio interviews.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
It's not violence and war,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
it's not race, it's not gender,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
They are: the arts and parenting.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
(Laughter)

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
So let me tell you what

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
aroused such irate responses,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
and I'll let you decide if whether they --

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
the claims are really that outrageous.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
Let me start with the arts.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
I note that among the long list of human universals

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
that I presented a few slides ago

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
are art.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
There is no society ever discovered

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
that we would consider the arts.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
appears to be a human universal.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
The telling of stories, music,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
dance, poetry -- found in all cultures,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
and many of the motifs and themes

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.330
that

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
give us pleasure in the arts

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
can be found in all human societies:

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
a preference for symmetrical forms,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
the use of repetition and variation,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
even things as specific as the fact

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
that in poetry all over the world,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
you have lines that are very close

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
to three seconds long, separated by pauses.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
Now, on the other hand,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
in the second half of the 20th century,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
the arts are frequently said to be in decline.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And I have a collection,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
deploring the fact that

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
the arts are in decline in our time.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
I'll give you a couple of representative quotes:

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
are visible in every department of human activity."

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
And a more recent one:

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
is becoming increasing problematical.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
Serious book stores are losing their franchise,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
by commercializing their repertory,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
symphony orchestras are diluting their programs,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
public television is increasing its dependence

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
on reruns of British sitcoms,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
classical radio stations are dwindling,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
That's from Robert Brustein,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
the famous drama critic and director,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
in The New Republic about five years ago.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
but by any standard

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
they have never been flourishing

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
to a greater extent.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
There are, of course, entirely new art forms

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
and new media, many of which you've heard

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
over these few days.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
By any economic standard,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
the demand for art of all forms

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
is skyrocketing,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
as you can tell from the price of opera tickets,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
by the number of books sold,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
by the number of books published,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.330
the number of musical titles released,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
the number of new albums and so on.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
The only grain of truth to this

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
complaint that the arts are in decline

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.330
come from three spheres.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
One of them is in elite art since the 1930s --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
say, the kinds of works performed

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
by major symphony orchestras,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
where most of the repertory is before 1930,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.330
or the works shown in

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
major galleries and prestigious museums.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
In literary criticism and analysis,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
probably 40 or 50 years ago,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
literary critics were a kind of cultural hero;

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
now they're kind of a national joke.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
And the humanities and arts programs

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
in the universities, which by many measures,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
indeed are in decline.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Students are staying away in droves,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
universities are disinvesting

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
in the arts and humanities.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
Well, here's a diagnosis.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
they need all the help that they can get.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
that this supposed decline

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
in the elite arts and criticism

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
occurred in the same point in history in which

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
there was a widespread denial of human nature.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
A famous quotation can be found --

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
if you look on the web, you can find it in

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
literally scores

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
of English core syllabuses --

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
"In or about December 1910,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
human nature changed."

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.330
and there's some debate

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
as to what she actually meant by that.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
that -- it's used now

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
as a way of saying that all forms

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
of appreciation of art

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.330
that were in place for centuries, or millennia,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
in the 20th century were discarded.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
The beauty and pleasure in art --

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
probably a human universal --

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
were -- began to be considered saccharine,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
or kitsch, or commercial.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
is the desire to destroy beauty" --

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.330
which was considered bourgeois or tacky.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
And here's just one example.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.330
I mean, this is perhaps a representative example

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
of the visual depiction of the female form

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
in the 15th century;

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
here is a representative example

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
And, as you can see, there -- something has changed

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
in the way the elite arts

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
appeal to the senses.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Indeed, in movements of modernism

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
and post-modernism,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
there was visual art without beauty,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
literature without narrative and plot,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
poetry without meter and rhyme,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
architecture and planning without ornament,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
human scale, green space and natural light,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.330
music without melody and rhythm,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
and criticism without clarity,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
(Laughter)

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.330
But here, there -- one of the most famous literary

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
English scholars of our time

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
is the Berkeley professor,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
Judith Butler.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
And here is an example of

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.330
one of her analyses:

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
"The move from a structuralist account in which capital

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
is understood to structure social relations

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
in relatively homologous ways

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.330
convergence and rearticulation

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.330
brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.330
Well, you get the idea.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
By the way, this is one sentence --

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.330
you can actually parse it.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.330
Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate"

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
was that elite art and criticism

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.330
in the 20th century,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.330
although not the arts in general,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.330
have disdained beauty, pleasure,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
clarity, insight and style.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330
People are staying away from elite art and criticism.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
What a puzzle -- I wonder why.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
Well, this turned out to be probably

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.330
the most controversial claim in the book.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.330
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
in order to deflect ire

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.330
from discussions of gender and Nazism

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330
and race and so on. I won't comment on that.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.330
But it certainly inspired

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.330
an energetic reaction

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.330
from many university professors.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.330
Well, the other hot button is parenting.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.330
And the starting point is the -- for that discussion

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.330
was the fact that we have all

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.330
been subject to the advice

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.330
of the parenting industrial complex.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.330
Now, here is -- here is a

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
representative quote from a besieged mother:

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.330
"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.330
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.330
so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.330
so they'll grow up to be healthy adults.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.330
And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.330
so they'll grow up smart.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.330
And there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.330
word games for reading success, large motor play,

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.330
small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.330
to figuring out what to play with my kids."

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.330
I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.330
with this mother.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.330
Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.330
are useless. They're useless because they don't control

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
for heritability. They measure some correlation

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
between what the parents do, how the children turn out

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
and assume a causal relation:

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
that the parenting shaped the child.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.330
Parents who talk a lot to their kids

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.330
have kids who grow up to be articulate,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.330
parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.330
to be violent and so on.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.330
And very few of them control for the possibility

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.330
that parents pass on genes for --

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.330
that increase the chances a child will be articulate

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.330
or violent and so on.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.330
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children,

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.330
who provide an environment

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.330
but not genes to their kids,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.330
we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.330
The genetically controlled studies

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.330
have some sobering results.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.330
Remember the Mallifert twins:

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.330
separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
remarkably similar.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.330
Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.330
You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.330
because not only would they share their genes,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.330
but they would also share their environment.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.330
That would make them super-similar, right?

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.330
who are separated at birth are no less similar

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.330
than if they had grown up together.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.330
Everything that happens to you in a given home

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.330
over all of those years

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.330
appears to leave no permanent stamp

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.330
on your personality or intellect.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.330
A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.330
is that adopted siblings reared together --

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.330
the mirror image of identical twins reared apart,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.330
they share their parents, their home,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.330
their neighborhood,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.330
don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.330
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.330
What it suggests is that children are shaped

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.330
not by their parents over the long run,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.330
but in part -- only in part -- by their genes,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.330
in part by their culture --

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.330
the culture of the country at large

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.330
and the children's own culture, namely their peer group --

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.330
as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.330
that's what kids care about --

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.330
and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.330
by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.330
chance events as you live your life.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.330
So let me conclude

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.330
with just a remark

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.330
to bring it back to the theme of choices.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.330
I think that the sciences of human nature --

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.330
behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, 

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.330
neuroscience, cognitive science --

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.330
are going to, increasingly in the years to come,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.330
upset various dogmas,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.330
careers and deeply-held political belief systems.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.330
And that presents us with a choice.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.330
The choice is whether certain facts about humans,

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.330
or topics, are to be considered taboos,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.330
forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.330
because no good can come from it,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.330
or whether we should explore them honestly.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.330
I have my own

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.330
answer to that question,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.330
which comes from a great artist of the 19th century,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.330
Anton Chekhov, who said,

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.330
"Man will become better when you show him

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.330
what he is like."

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.330
And I think that the argument

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.330
can't be put any more eloquently than that.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.330
Thank you very much.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.330
(Applause)
