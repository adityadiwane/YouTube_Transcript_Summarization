00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
I'm really here by accident.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm --

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I would truly consider an accident.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.330
But what I'd like to talk to you about today

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
is perhaps a way in which we could use technology

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
to make those accidents happen often.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.330
Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
in this accident, technology played a big role in that.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.330
And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
are children and education.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
And once I put that in context,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.330
a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.330
that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
And then I'll come back to the beginning,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.330
and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you --

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.330
that I believe that in today's world,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
it is really important for business leaders

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
not only to have an idea of what their business is all about,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
but to have a passion for something that is meaningful.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.330
I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
So I grew up in a family of women.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
(Laughter)

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
I was born in a very small village in Mexico,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.330
in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and my parents did not have a college education.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
that my parents placed on education.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
My parents were fanatics about learning,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
and I'll come back to that a little bit later.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
But one of the things that exposed me early to learning,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.330
was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
My father found that in a junkyard,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
of what was going on in the world -- but,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
was a real exposure to me to classical music.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.330
He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
that became so famous in the world.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And would tell me a little bit about history too,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.330
when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.330
and why this music,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
in some way, represented a little bit of that history.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.330
And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.330
And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
but if you can imagine the time when this occurred --

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.330
it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.330
Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
distill from that experience is that in addition to that,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.330
people ask me and say, "Well,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
how did your parents treat you when you were a child?"

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
And I always said that they were really tough on me.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And not tough in the sense that most people think of,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.330
where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.330
both my mother and father would always say to me,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
it's really important that you always remember two things.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
First of all, when you go to bed at night,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
the day was a day which you contributed something, and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And the second thing they said: and we trust you,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that no matter where you are or where you go,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
you will always do the right thing.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
but if you do, please trust me,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.330
(Laughter)

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
When I was out with my friends drinking beer,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
I always was very aware of those words --

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
(Laughter)

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.330
-- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.330
is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
is not necessarily what happens

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
in a lot of the technology that is done today.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
So, one of our passions in our company,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.330
at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
And to me, that is very, very critical.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.330
You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.330
Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
What we believe is that the Internet, frankly,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
is a connection of people and ideas.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
The Internet happens to be just the medium

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
in which those people and ideas get connected.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.330
If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.330
that have come to the market today, the key to me is

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.330
how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330
accessibility, in an easy manner,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
and also affordability, that

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.330
regardless of the economic status that a person could have,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.330
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
And a couple of years ago at AMD,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
we came up with this idea of saying,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
what if we create this initiative we call 50x15,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.330
where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
half of the world will be connected to the Internet

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
so that people and ideas can get connected.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.330
did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
We always felt that this was something that could be done

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
through partnerships with governments, industry,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.330
educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.330
So, it is really a rather lofty initiative,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.330
if you want to think that way,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
that was bold enough and courageous enough

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.330
the results so far have been remarkable,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
and I can only anticipate and get real excited about

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
what I think is going to happen in the next eight years,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
while we get to the 2015 initiative.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.330
Where are we today?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.330
That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Those of you who've never looked at their website,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
how the Internet penetration has changed over the years.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.330
well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
One is the Western world,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
has made an awful lot of progress.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
The connectivity in these parts of the world

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.330
As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.330
even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
such as India and China, the progress has been good --

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.330
has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.330
places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
I was just recently visiting South Africa.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.330
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.330
It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.330
So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.330
So, when you look at this chart,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
you look at the very end:

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.330
to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
working with so many partners around the world,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
to be able to reach that goal.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.330
which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It is actually a business venture.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.330
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
and call it the education market.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
When you look at elementary-school children,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.330
that could benefit tremendously

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
from being able to be connected to the Internet.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.330
to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.330
This is really a business venture,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.330
one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.330
Because what we have learned in the last three years

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
is that this segment of the market, whether it's education

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.330
incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.330
tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
that frankly, without actually doing it,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
it would be very difficult to understand, and

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
I'll explain that in just a minute.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
What we mean by that is,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.330
more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.330
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
when I say this, but I truly mean it --

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
it would be very difficult to judge who made it,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
So, there has not been a human-centric approach

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
to addressing this segment of the market,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
so we really believe it is critical to think of it.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.330
operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
We're talking about something very similar here.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
the government plays a key role in the development of technology.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.330
In other parts, it doesn't.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
that allows for manufacturing to take place.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
about how this technology can be developed

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
and put into action in those regions.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
And the last piece, which is really important --

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.330
can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
What I mean by that, and let me use this example,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
the country of South Africa, because I was just there,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.330
It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
It's beginning to grow tremendously.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
They're developing a software-training environment in their universities.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
What a place, what an ideal place

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.330
needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.330
English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:55.330
And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.330
it could only be done from inside.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.330
by companies parachuting from another place of the world,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
and just dumping product and selling into the markets.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
So, we believe that in those regions of the world

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.330
where the population is large,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
and there's an infrastructure that can provide it,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
that a local, integrated, end-to-end system

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
is really critical for its success.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
in Mexico, in my home country.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico --

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
Michoacan is a very colorful state.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:44.330
and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:49.330
in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:58.330
and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.330
in the West Cape in South Africa,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:14.330
and when you see the faces and activities of these children

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
And recently, they've written us letters,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
telling us how excited they are about the impact

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.330
that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.330
We have now deployed 30 different technologists

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.330
in 18 different countries, and we have been able

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.330
to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
And I have to tell you that although

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.330
millions doesn't sound like a lot

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
in terms of the billions that need to be connected,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
it's a start. And we are learning a lot.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
And we're learning a tremendous amount about

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.330
Some of you are familiar with this.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330
Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.330
The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.330
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.330
one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.330
is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.330
Because it was felt that a school day

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.330
would last at least eight hours, and

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.330
for at least one full day without having to recharge it.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.330
and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
just through a lot of innovative work people have done

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.330
because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.330
and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
in the field of education.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:56.330
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
not only in the developing countries, but actually

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
in the developed regions as well, because

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
there are parts of the United States where this can have

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.330
also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
We also have partnered with TED

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
in this project, with Architecture for Humanity,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.330
and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.330
we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:25.330
to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.330
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.330
and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
Let me come back to the beginning,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.330
to end this presentation.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.330
I'll tell you that one of the things

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.330
that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.330
is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.330
I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.330
and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.330
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents --

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.330
and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.330
And it took me a while to understand it,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.330
but he said to me, when I went to college, he said,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
"You're the first person in the family to go to college.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
And it's really important you understand

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.330
that for civilization to make progress,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.330
each generation has to do better than the last one.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.330
And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.330
Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.330
I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:37.330
and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.330
I graduated. I decided to get married.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.330
I'm going to remind you again, that each generation

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
has to do better than the last one.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.330
You have to be a better husband than I was,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.330
because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.330
Because I knew what a great husband he was,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.330
and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.330
like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.330
my first child, and again, my father comes

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.330
and see all the children on the other side, and he said,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.330
"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.330
you're going to have to be a better father than I was."

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.330
That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.330
that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.330
to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.330
to really get up and think that my role in life

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.330
is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
It's got to be that someday I can look back,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.330
and this place is truly better through some small contribution

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.330
that perhaps each of us could make.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.330
Thank you very much.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.330
(Applause)
