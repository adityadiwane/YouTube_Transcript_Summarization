00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:16.340
My seven-year-old grandson
sleeps just down the hall from me,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.030
and he wakes up a lot of mornings

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:19.592
and he says,

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:21.830
"You know, this could be
the best day ever."

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.562
And other times,
in the middle of the night,

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:27.512
he calls out in a tremulous voice,

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:30.366
"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:35.460
I think this pretty much says it for me
and most of the people I know,

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:38.764
that we're a mixed grill
of happy anticipation

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.007
and dread.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.622
So I sat down a few days
before my 61st birthday,

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:49.307
and I decided to compile a list
of everything I know for sure.

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:52.960
There's so little truth
in the popular culture,

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:55.940
and it's good to be sure of a few things.

00:00:57.037 --> 00:00:59.958
For instance, I am no longer 47,

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.445
although this is the age I feel,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.086
and the age I like to think
of myself as being.

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:09.347
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s

00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:12.954
that he felt like a young man
with something really wrong with him.

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:16.828
(Laughter)

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:19.692
Our true person is outside
of time and space,

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.226
but looking at the paperwork,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.585
I can, in fact, see
that I was born in 1954.

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:28.125
My inside self is outside
of time and space.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.194
It doesn't have an age.

00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:33.567
I'm every age I've ever been,
and so are you,

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.275
although I can't help
mentioning as an aside

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.930
that it might have been helpful
if I hadn't followed

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:41.475
the skin care rules of the '60s,

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.893
which involved getting
as much sun as possible

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.463
while slathered in baby oil

00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:51.734
and basking in the glow
of a tinfoil reflector shield.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:53.472
(Laughter)

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.094
It was so liberating, though,
to face the truth

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:59.466
that I was no longer
in the last throes of middle age,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.842
that I decided to write down
every single true thing I know.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:07.264
People feel really doomed
and overwhelmed these days,

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:10.010
and they keep asking me what's true.

00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:16.383
So I hope that my list of things
I'm almost positive about

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.472
might offer some basic
operating instructions

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:23.143
to anyone who is feeling
really overwhelmed or beleaguered.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.842
Number one:

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.527
the first and truest thing
is that all truth is a paradox.

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.866
Life is both a precious,
unfathomably beautiful gift,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.572
and it's impossible here,
on the incarnational side of things.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:40.216
It's been a very bad match

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.506
for those of us who were born
extremely sensitive.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.394
It's so hard and weird
that we sometimes wonder

00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:47.854
if we're being punked.

00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:53.776
It's filled simultaneously
with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.575
desperate poverty,

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.143
floods and babies and acne and Mozart,

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.306
all swirled together.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.900
I don't think it's an ideal system.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:07.240
(Laughter)

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:10.659
Number two: almost
everything will work again

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:13.024
if you unplug it for a few minutes --

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:15.743
(Laughter)

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.049
(Applause)

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.796
including you.

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:26.033
Three: there is almost
nothing outside of you

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.969
that will help in any kind of lasting way,

00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:30.957
unless you're waiting for an organ.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:36.716
You can't buy, achieve or date
serenity and peace of mind.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.514
This is the most horrible truth,
and I so resent it.

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.593
But it's an inside job,

00:03:43.617 --> 00:03:46.435
and we can't arrange peace
or lasting improvement

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.847
for the people we love most in the world.

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.951
They have to find their own ways,

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:52.597
their own answers.

00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:56.248
You can't run alongside
your grown children

00:03:56.272 --> 00:04:00.858
with sunscreen and ChapStick
on their hero's journey.

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:02.999
You have to release them.

00:04:03.023 --> 00:04:05.418
It's disrespectful not to.

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:08.767
And if it's someone else's problem,

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.091
you probably don't have
the answer, anyway.

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:12.307
(Laughter)

00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:15.074
Our help is usually not very helpful.

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.993
Our help is often toxic.

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:21.440
And help is the sunny side of control.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:25.130
Stop helping so much.

00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:28.611
Don't get your help and goodness
all over everybody.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.147
(Laughter)

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.832
(Applause)

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.829
This brings us to number four:

00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:38.737
everyone is screwed up,
broken, clingy and scared,

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.736
even the people who seem
to have it most together.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.199
They are much more like you
than you would believe,

00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:48.871
so try not to compare your insides
to other people's outsides.

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:51.761
It will only make you worse
than you already are.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.777
(Laughter)

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:59.563
Also, you can't save, fix
or rescue any of them

00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.622
or get anyone sober.

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:04.400
What helped me get clean
and sober 30 years ago

00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:08.035
was the catastrophe
of my behavior and thinking.

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.065
So I asked some sober friends for help,

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.023
and I turned to a higher power.

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:16.106
One acronym for God
is the "gift of desperation,"

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.559
G-O-D,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.615
or as a sober friend put it,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.606
by the end I was deteriorating faster
than I could lower my standards.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.941
(Laughter)

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:33.275
So God might mean, in this case,

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.440
"me running out of any more good ideas."

00:05:37.352 --> 00:05:41.518
While fixing and saving
and trying to rescue is futile,

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.953
radical self-care is quantum,

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:48.593
and it radiates out from you
into the atmosphere

00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:50.262
like a little fresh air.

00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:52.867
It's a huge gift to the world.

00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:57.401
When people respond by saying,
"Well, isn't she full of herself,"

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.391
just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:03.377
and make both of you a nice cup of tea.

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:09.108
Being full of affection
for one's goofy, self-centered,

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:11.625
cranky, annoying self

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:13.178
is home.

00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:15.234
It's where world peace begins.

00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:18.575
Number five:

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.663
chocolate with 75 percent cacao
is not actually a food.

00:06:23.687 --> 00:06:27.699
(Laughter)

00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:31.803
Its best use is as a bait in snake traps

00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:36.387
or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.

00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.662
It was never meant
to be considered an edible.

00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:43.050
Number six --

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:46.578
(Laughter)

00:06:46.602 --> 00:06:47.858
writing.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:53.082
Every writer you know writes
really terrible first drafts,

00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:55.259
but they keep their butt in the chair.

00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:57.003
That's the secret of life.

00:06:57.027 --> 00:07:00.227
That's probably the main difference
between you and them.

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:01.713
They just do it.

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:04.303
They do it by prearrangement
with themselves.

00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:06.370
They do it as a debt of honor.

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.450
They tell stories that come through them

00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:11.984
one day at a time, little by little.

00:07:12.008 --> 00:07:14.234
When my older brother was in fourth grade,

00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:18.232
he had a term paper on birds
due the next day,

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:20.536
and he hadn't started.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.642
So my dad sat down with him
with an Audubon book,

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:27.010
paper, pencils and brads --

00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:32.634
for those of you who have gotten
a little less young and remember brads --

00:07:32.658 --> 00:07:35.488
and he said to my brother,

00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:38.122
"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.461
Just read about pelicans

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:44.341
and then write about pelicans
in your own voice.

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:47.520
And then find out about chickadees,

00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:50.315
and tell us about them in your own voice.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.085
And then geese."

00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:55.857
So the two most important things
about writing are: bird by bird

00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:58.987
and really god-awful first drafts.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.454
If you don't know where to start,

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.707
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours,

00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:06.247
and you get to tell it.

00:08:06.672 --> 00:08:09.834
If people wanted you to write
more warmly about them,

00:08:09.858 --> 00:08:11.578
they should've behaved better.

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:14.632
(Laughter)

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:17.566
(Applause)

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.838
You're going to feel like hell
if you wake up someday

00:08:21.862 --> 00:08:23.623
and you never wrote the stuff

00:08:23.647 --> 00:08:27.108
that is tugging on the sleeves
of your heart:

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.528
your stories, memories,
visions and songs --

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.205
your truth,

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:34.054
your version of things --

00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:35.563
in your own voice.

00:08:35.587 --> 00:08:38.062
That's really all you have to offer us,

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:40.540
and that's also why you were born.

00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:46.493
Seven: publication and temporary
creative successes

00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:48.707
are something you have to recover from.

00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:52.406
They kill as many people as not.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.960
They will hurt, damage and change you

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:57.098
in ways you cannot imagine.

00:08:57.527 --> 00:09:01.043
The most degraded
and evil people I've ever known

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:04.176
are male writers who've had
huge best sellers.

00:09:04.913 --> 00:09:09.070
And yet, returning to number one,
that all truth is paradox,

00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:11.519
it's also a miracle
to get your work published,

00:09:11.543 --> 00:09:14.379
to get your stories read and heard.

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:17.158
Just try to bust yourself
gently of the fantasy

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.636
that publication will heal you,

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.744
that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy
holes inside of you.

00:09:23.768 --> 00:09:25.362
It can't.

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:26.746
It won't.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.475
But writing can.

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:32.097
So can singing in a choir
or a bluegrass band.

00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:35.428
So can painting community
murals or birding

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:38.620
or fostering old dogs
that no one else will.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.441
Number eight: families.

00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:47.799
Families are hard, hard, hard,

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:51.249
no matter how cherished
and astonishing they may also be.

00:09:51.273 --> 00:09:53.399
Again, see number one.

00:09:53.423 --> 00:09:54.470
(Laughter)

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:58.782
At family gatherings where you suddenly
feel homicidal or suicidal --

00:09:58.806 --> 00:09:59.822
(Laughter)

00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:02.177
remember that in all cases,

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:07.665
it's a miracle that any of us,
specifically, were conceived and born.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.267
Earth is forgiveness school.

00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.401
It begins with forgiving yourself,

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:15.699
and then you might as well
start at the dinner table.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.105
That way, you can do this work
in comfortable pants.

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:23.075
(Laughter)

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:25.046
When William Blake said that we are here

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.058
to learn to endure the beams of love,

00:10:28.082 --> 00:10:31.415
he knew that your family would be
an intimate part of this,

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:35.133
even as you want to run screaming
for your cute little life.

00:10:35.631 --> 00:10:38.190
But I promise you are up to it.

00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:41.594
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:43.643
and you will be amazed.

00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:46.777
Nine: food.

00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:50.545
Try to do a little better.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.207
I think you know what I mean.

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:56.876
(Laughter)

00:11:02.979 --> 00:11:04.130
Number 10 --

00:11:04.154 --> 00:11:06.378
(Laughter)

00:11:06.402 --> 00:11:07.587
grace.

00:11:08.248 --> 00:11:11.355
Grace is spiritual WD-40,

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.859
or water wings.

00:11:12.883 --> 00:11:18.850
The mystery of grace is that God loves
Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin

00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:20.033
and me

00:11:20.057 --> 00:11:24.413
exactly as much as He or She
loves your new grandchild.

00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:26.025
Go figure.

00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:27.826
(Laughter)

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.187
The movement of grace
is what changes us, heals us

00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.209
and heals our world.

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:37.004
To summon grace, say, "Help,"
and then buckle up.

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.718
Grace finds you exactly where you are,

00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:42.267
but it doesn't leave you
where it found you.

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:45.387
And grace won't look
like Casper the Friendly Ghost,

00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:47.016
regrettably.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.423
But the phone will ring
or the mail will come

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:50.927
and then against all odds,

00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:53.930
you'll get your sense of humor
about yourself back.

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:57.710
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:01.386
It helps us breathe again and again

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.543
and gives us back to ourselves,

00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:07.304
and this gives us faith
in life and each other.

00:12:08.315 --> 00:12:12.293
And remember -- grace always bats last.

00:12:13.472 --> 00:12:16.581
Eleven: God just means goodness.

00:12:16.605 --> 00:12:19.046
It's really not all that scary.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.520
It means the divine or a loving,
animating intelligence,

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:27.269
or, as we learned
from the great "Deteriorata,"

00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:28.901
"the cosmic muffin."

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.539
A good name for God is: "Not me."

00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:36.393
Emerson said that
the happiest person on Earth

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:40.595
is the one who learns from nature
the lessons of worship.

00:12:40.619 --> 00:12:43.745
So go outside a lot and look up.

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:48.272
My pastor said you can trap bees
on the bottom of mason jars without lids

00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:50.009
because they don't look up,

00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:54.433
so they just walk around bitterly
bumping into the glass walls.

00:12:54.457 --> 00:12:56.825
Go outside. Look up.

00:12:56.849 --> 00:12:58.216
Secret of life.

00:12:59.297 --> 00:13:01.161
And finally: death.

00:13:02.193 --> 00:13:03.473
Number 12.

00:13:04.466 --> 00:13:06.243
Wow and yikes.

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:11.420
It's so hard to bear when the few people
you cannot live without die.

00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:15.081
You'll never get over these losses,
and no matter what the culture says,

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:16.972
you're not supposed to.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:22.139
We Christians like to think of death
as a major change of address,

00:13:22.163 --> 00:13:26.749
but in any case, the person
will live again fully in your heart

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:28.765
if you don't seal it off.

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:31.557
Like Leonard Cohen said,
"There are cracks in everything,

00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:33.434
and that's how the light gets in."

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.036
And that's how we feel
our people again fully alive.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.071
Also, the people will make
you laugh out loud

00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:46.161
at the most inconvenient times,

00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:48.259
and that's the great good news.

00:13:48.283 --> 00:13:52.738
But their absence will also be a lifelong
nightmare of homesickness for you.

00:13:52.762 --> 00:13:57.443
Grief and friends, time and tears
will heal you to some extent.

00:13:57.467 --> 00:14:01.718
Tears will bathe and baptize
and hydrate and moisturize you

00:14:01.742 --> 00:14:04.071
and the ground on which you walk.

00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:07.126
Do you know the first thing
that God says to Moses?

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:10.342
He says, "Take off your shoes."

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:14.939
Because this is holy ground,
all evidence to the contrary.

00:14:14.963 --> 00:14:18.028
It's hard to believe,
but it's the truest thing I know.

00:14:18.052 --> 00:14:22.194
When you're a little bit older,
like my tiny personal self,

00:14:22.218 --> 00:14:26.024
you realize that death
is as sacred as birth.

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:29.599
And don't worry -- get on with your life.

00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:34.720
Almost every single death
is easy and gentle

00:14:34.744 --> 00:14:37.760
with the very best people surrounding you

00:14:37.784 --> 00:14:39.627
for as long as you need.

00:14:39.651 --> 00:14:41.291
You won't be alone.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:46.174
They'll help you cross over
to whatever awaits us.

00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:48.428
As Ram Dass said,

00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.312
"When all is said and done,

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:53.336
we're really just all walking
each other home."

00:14:54.844 --> 00:14:56.432
I think that's it,

00:14:56.456 --> 00:14:58.558
but if I think of anything else,

00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:00.044
I'll let you know.

00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:01.271
Thank you.

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:02.874
(Applause)

00:15:02.898 --> 00:15:04.174
Thank you.

00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:06.006
(Applause)

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.184
I was very surprised to be asked to come,

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.891
because it is not my realm,

00:15:10.915 --> 00:15:13.242
technology or design or entertainment.

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:16.447
I mean, my realm is sort of
faith and writing

00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:19.421
and kind of lurching along together.

00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:21.208
And I was surprised,

00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:25.505
but they said I could give a talk,
and I said I'd love to.

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:27.581
(Video) If you don't know where to start,

00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:30.730
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours

00:15:30.754 --> 00:15:32.132
and you get to tell it.

00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:35.261
Anne Lamott: People are very frightened
and feel really doomed

00:15:35.285 --> 00:15:36.473
in America these days,

00:15:36.497 --> 00:15:39.638
and I just wanted to help people
get their sense of humor about it

00:15:39.662 --> 00:15:43.260
and to realize how much isn't a problem.

00:15:43.284 --> 00:15:46.510
If you take an action,

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:50.922
take a really healthy or loving
or friendly action,

00:15:50.946 --> 00:15:53.807
you'll have loving and friendly feelings.
