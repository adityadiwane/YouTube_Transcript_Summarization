00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:16.596
People back home call me a heckler,

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.313
a troublemaker, an irritant,

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:21.983
a rebel, an activist,

00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:23.840
the voice of the people.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.010
But that wasn't always me.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.182
Growing up, I had a nickname.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.502
They used to call me Softy,

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:33.755
meaning the soft, harmless boy.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.495
Like every other human being,
I avoided trouble.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.538
In my childhood, they taught me silence.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.340
Don't argue, do as you're told.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.272
In Sunday school, they taught me
don't confront, don't argue,

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:47.585
even if you're right,
turn the other cheek.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:52.182
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the time.

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:55.783
(Laughter)

00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:57.592
Kenya is a country
where you are guilty

00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:00.239
until proven rich.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.984
(Laughter)

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.726
Kenya's poor are five times more likely

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:08.650
to be shot dead by the police
who are meant to protect them

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.298
than by criminals.

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:12.945
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the day.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:15.894
We had a president,
Moi, who was a dictator.

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:18.100
He ruled the country with an iron fist,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.538
and anyone who dared
question his authority

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:25.507
was arrested, tortured,
jailed or even killed.

00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:29.431
That meant that people were taught
to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.474
Being a coward was not an insult.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.401
Being a coward was a compliment.

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:36.559
We used to be told that a coward
goes home to his mother.

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:40.320
What that meant: that if you stayed
out of trouble you're going to stay alive.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260
I used to question this advice,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.082
and eight years ago
we had an election in Kenya,

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.565
and the results were violently disputed.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:52.302
What followed that election
was terrible violence, rape,

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:56.239
and the killing of over 1,000 people.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.360
My work was to document the violence.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.216
As a photographer,
I took thousands of images,

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:04.283
and after two months,

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:09.158
the two politicians came together,
had a cup of tea,

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:12.595
signed a peace agreement,
and the country moved on.

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:16.124
I was a very disturbed man
because I saw the violence firsthand.

00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:19.730
I saw the killings.
I saw the displacement.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.811
I met women who had been raped,
and it disturbed me,

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:24.855
but the country never spoke about it.

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:27.339
We pretended. We all became smart cowards.

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.938
We decided to stay out of trouble
and not talk about it.

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:34.235
Ten months later, I quit my job.
I said I could not stand it anymore.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:36.830
After quitting my job,
I decided to organize my friends

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.850
to speak about
the violence in the country,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.714
to speak about the state of the nation,

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:44.830
and June 1, 2009 was the day
that we were meant to go to the stadium

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.889
and try and get the president's attention.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.329
It's a national holiday,

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.978
it's broadcast across the country,

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.386
and I showed up at the stadium.

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:56.380
My friends did not show up.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.753
I found myself alone,

00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:02.280
and I didn't know what to do.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.695
I was scared,

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.865
but I knew very well
that that particular day,

00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:07.086
I had to make a decision.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.509
Was I able to live as a coward,
like everyone else,

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.107
or was I going to make a stand?

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.313
And when the president stood up to speak,

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:17.920
I found myself on my feet
shouting at the president,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.114
telling him to remember
the post-election violence victims,

00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:23.390
to stop the corruption.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.595
And suddenly, out of nowhere,

00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:28.707
the police pounced on me
like hungry lions.

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:30.564
They held my mouth

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:32.491
and dragged me out of the stadium,

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:35.462
where they thoroughly beat me up
and locked me up in jail.

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:43.870
I spent that night in
a cold cement floor in the jail,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.518
and that got me thinking.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.389
What was making me feel this way?

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.554
My friends and family thought
I was crazy because of what I did,

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:56.568
and the images that I took
were disturbing my life.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.518
The images that I took
were just a number to many Kenyans.

00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:01.465
Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:03.160
It was a story to them.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.947
And so I decided to actually
start a street exhibition

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.733
to show the images of the violence
across the country

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.707
and get people talking about it.

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:13.516
We traveled the country
and showed the images,

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.999
and this was a journey that has started me
to the activist path,

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.716
where I decided to become silent no more,

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:21.914
to talk about those things.

00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:25.564
We traveled, and our general site
from our street exhibit

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:30.362
became for political graffiti
about the situation in the country,

00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:33.120
talking about corruption, bad leadership.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.900
We have even done symbolic burials.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.882
We have delivered live pigs
to Kenya's parliament

00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:42.810
as a symbol of our politicians' greed.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.041
It has been done in Uganda
and other countries,

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.550
and what is most powerful is that
the images have been picked by the media

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.586
and amplified across the country,
across the continent.

00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:54.233
Where I used to stand up alone
seven years ago,

00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:57.259
now I belong to a community
of many people who stand up with me.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.587
I am no longer alone when I stand up
to speak about these things.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:06.350
I belong to a group of young people
who are passionate about the country,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.200
who want to bring about change,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.614
and they're no longer afraid,
and they're no longer smart cowards.

00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:16.472
So that was my story.

00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:20.840
That day in the stadium,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.327
I stood up as a smart coward.

00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:28.574
By that one action, I said goodbye
to the 24 years living as a coward.

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:31.616
There are two most powerful
days in your life:

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:36.162
the day you're born,
and the day you discover why.

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.015
That day standing up in that stadium
shouting at the President,

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:43.295
I discovered why I was truly born,

00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:46.546
that I would no longer be silent
in the face of injustice.

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:50.580
Do you know why you were born?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.535
Thank you.

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:58.454
(Applause)

00:06:00.524 --> 00:06:03.031
Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.

00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:05.587
I just want to ask you
a couple quick questions.

00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:07.907
So PAWA254:

00:06:07.907 --> 00:06:12.220
you've created a studio, a place
where young people can go

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.176
and harness the power of digital media

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:16.687
to do some of this action.

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:18.564
What's happening now with PAWA?

00:06:18.564 --> 00:06:21.347
Boniface Mwangi: So we have 
this community of filmmakers,

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:24.710
graffiti artists, musicians,
and when there's an issue in the country,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.511
we come together, we brainstorm,
and take up on that issue.

00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:29.567
So our most powerful tool is art,

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:33.398
because we live in a very busy world
where people are so busy in their life,

00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:35.465
and they don't have time to read.

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:39.598
So we package our activism
and we package our message in art.

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:44.577
So from the music, the graffiti, 
the art, that's what we do.

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:47.585
Can I say one more thing?

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:49.466
TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)

00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:52.101
BM: In spite of being arrested,
beaten up, threatened,

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:53.814
the moment I discovered my voice,

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.710
that I could actually stand up
for what I really believed in,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.748
I'm no longer afraid.

00:06:57.748 --> 00:07:00.490
I used to be called softy,
but I'm no longer softy,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.891
because I discovered who I really am,
as in, that's what I want to do,

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.927
and there's such beauty in doing that.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:10.316
There's nothing as powerful as that,
knowing that I'm meant to do this,

00:07:10.316 --> 00:07:13.463
because you don't get scared,
you just continue living your life.

00:07:13.463 --> 00:07:15.649
Thank you.

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.239
(Applause)
