00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.062
I wanted to talk to you today
about creative confidence.

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:23.847
I'm going to start way back
in the third grade

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.792
at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:31.237
I remember one day my best friend
Brian was working on a project.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.113
He was making a horse out of the clay
our teacher kept under the sink.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.935
And at one point, one of the girls
that was sitting at his table,

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.573
seeing what he was doing,
leaned over and said to him,

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:47.651
"That's terrible. That doesn't look
anything like a horse."

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.803
And Brian's shoulders sank.

00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:54.140
And he wadded up the clay horse
and he threw it back in the bin.

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:59.349
I never saw Brian do a project
like that ever again.

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.516
And I wonder how often
that happens, you know?

00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:06.841
It seems like when I tell
that story of Brian to my class,

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.309
a lot of them want to come up after class

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.350
and tell me about
their similar experience,

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:13.984
how a teacher shut them down,

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.669
or how a student
was particularly cruel to them.

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:20.235
And then some kind of opt out
of thinking of themselves as creative

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.414
at that point.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.037
And I see that opting out
that happens in childhood,

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:29.356
and it moves in and becomes
more ingrained, even,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.380
by the time you get to adult life.

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:37.538
So we see a lot of this.

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:38.962
When we have a workshop

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.732
or when we have clients
in to work with us side by side,

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:44.033
eventually we get
to the point in the process

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:46.378
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.541
And eventually, these big-shot executives
whip out their BlackBerrys

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:54.110
and they say they have to make
really important phone calls,

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:55.705
and they head for the exits.

00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:58.114
And they're just so uncomfortable.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.169
When we track them down
and ask them what's going on,

00:02:01.193 --> 00:02:04.116
they say something like,
"I'm just not the creative type."

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:06.447
But we know that's not true.

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:09.631
If they stick with the process,
if they stick with it,

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:11.876
they end up doing amazing things.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.850
And they surprise themselves
at just how innovative

00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:17.045
they and their teams really are.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:22.954
So I've been looking
at this fear of judgment that we have,

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:26.460
that you don't do things, you're afraid
you're going to be judged;

00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:30.281
if you don't say the right creative thing,
you're going to be judged.

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:32.976
And I had a major breakthrough,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.167
when I met the psychologist
Albert Bandura.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.468
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura,
but if you go to Wikipedia,

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:44.634
it says that he's the fourth most
important psychologist in history --

00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:48.367
you know, like Freud, Skinner,
somebody and Bandura.

00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.803
(Laughter)

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:52.811
Bandura is 86 and he still
works at Stanford.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.591
And he's just a lovely guy.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.622
So I went to see him,

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:01.148
because he's just worked
on phobias for a long time,

00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:02.605
which I'm very interested in.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.867
He had developed this way,

00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:09.617
this, kind of, methodology,

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.592
that ended up curing people
in a very short amount of time,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:13.975
like, in four hours.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.435
He had a huge cure rate
of people who had phobias.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.423
And we talked about snakes
-- I don't know why --

00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:24.629
we talked about snakes
and fear of snakes as a phobia.

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.487
And it was really enjoyable,
really interesting.

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.454
He told me that he'd invite
the test subject in,

00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:36.365
and he'd say, "You know,
there's a snake in the next room

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.993
and we're going to go in there."

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:41.821
To which, he reported,
most of them replied,

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:46.625
"Hell no! I'm not going in there,
certainly if there's a snake in there."

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.949
But Bandura has a step-by-step
process that was super successful.

00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:53.879
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:56.198
looking into the room where the snake was.

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:58.668
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:00.248
Then through a series of steps,

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.957
he'd move them and they'd be standing
in the doorway with the door open,

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:05.495
and they'd be looking in there.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.466
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.180
And then many more steps
later, baby steps,

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:14.276
they'd be in the room, they'd have
a leather glove like a welder's glove on,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.954
and they'd eventually touch the snake.

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:22.439
And when they touched the snake,
everything was fine. They were cured.

00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:24.583
In fact, everything was better than fine.

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:27.860
These people who had
lifelong fears of snakes

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.989
were saying things like,

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.634
"Look how beautiful that snake is."

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.773
And they were holding it in their laps.

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.486
Bandura calls this process
"guided mastery."

00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:43.429
I love that term: guided mastery.

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.021
And something else happened.

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:49.984
These people who went through the process
and touched the snake

00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.511
ended up having less anxiety
about other things in their lives.

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.351
They tried harder, they persevered longer,

00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:00.131
and they were more resilient
in the face of failure.

00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:03.808
They just gained a new confidence.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:09.478
And Bandura calls
that confidence "self-efficacy,"

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:12.747
the sense that you can change the world

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.595
and that you can attain
what you set out to do.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.481
Well, meeting Bandura
was really cathartic for me,

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:23.038
because I realized
that this famous scientist

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:26.222
had documented
and scientifically validated

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:29.637
something that we've seen happen
for the last 30 years:

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:33.450
that we could take people who had the fear
that they weren't creative,

00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:36.200
and we could take them
through a series of steps,

00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:39.620
kind of like a series of small successes,

00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:42.994
and they turn fear into familiarity.

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.050
And they surprise themselves.

00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:47.077
That transformation is amazing.

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.497
We see it at the d.school all the time.

00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:52.227
People from all different
kinds of disciplines,

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.742
they think of themselves
as only analytical.

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:58.270
And they come in and they go
through the process, our process,

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:01.476
they build confidence and now
they think of themselves differently.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.565
And they're totally emotionally excited
about the fact that they walk around

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.852
thinking of themselves
as a creative person.

00:06:10.826 --> 00:06:12.882
So I thought one
of the things I'd do today

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:16.108
is take you through and show you
what this journey looks like.

00:06:16.738 --> 00:06:21.232
To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:25.400
Doug Dietz is a technical person.

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:29.222
He designs large
medical imaging equipment.

00:06:29.692 --> 00:06:32.952
He's worked for GE, and he's had
a fantastic career.

00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:35.928
But at one point,
he had a moment of crisis.

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:40.399
He was in the hospital looking
at one of his MRI machines in use,

00:06:40.423 --> 00:06:43.670
when he saw a young family,
and this little girl.

00:06:44.047 --> 00:06:47.499
And that little girl was crying
and was terrified.

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:50.069
And Doug was really disappointed to learn

00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:54.757
that nearly 80 percent
of the pediatric patients in this hospital

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:58.499
had to be sedated in order
to deal with his MRI machine.

00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:02.404
And this was really disappointing to Doug,

00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:05.081
because before this time,
he was proud of what he did.

00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:07.236
He was saving lives with this machine.

00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:12.217
But it really hurt him to see the fear
that this machine caused in kids.

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:17.158
About that time, he was at the d.school
at Stanford taking classes.

00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:21.833
He was learning about our process,
about design thinking, about empathy,

00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:23.682
about iterative prototyping.

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:28.395
And he would take this new knowledge
and do something quite extraordinary.

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.156
He would redesign the entire experience

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.418
of being scanned.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.419
And this is what he came up with.

00:07:35.443 --> 00:07:36.462
(Laughter)

00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:39.059
He turned it into
an adventure for the kids.

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.341
He painted the walls
and he painted the machine,

00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:44.144
and he got the operators retrained
by people who know kids,

00:07:44.168 --> 00:07:46.678
like children's museum people.

00:07:46.702 --> 00:07:50.400
And now when the kid comes,
it's an experience.

00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:54.030
And they talk to them about the noise
and the movement of the ship.

00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:55.451
And when they come, they say,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.602
"OK, you're going to go
into the pirate ship,

00:07:57.626 --> 00:08:01.143
but be very still, because we don't want
the pirates to find you."

00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:05.330
And the results were super dramatic:

00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:09.384
from something like 80 percent
of the kids needing to be sedated,

00:08:09.408 --> 00:08:13.662
to something like 10 percent
of the kids needing to be sedated.

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:15.725
And the hospital and GE were happy, too,

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:18.908
because you didn't have to call
the anesthesiologist all the time,

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.740
and they could put more kids
through the machine in a day.

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:23.671
So the quantitative results were great.

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:27.361
But Doug's results that he cared about
were much more qualitative.

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:29.449
He was with one of the mothers

00:08:29.473 --> 00:08:31.783
waiting for her child
to come out of the scan.

00:08:31.807 --> 00:08:34.173
And when the little girl
came out of her scan,

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:36.093
she ran up to her mother and said,

00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:38.057
"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"

00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:40.309
(Laughter)

00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:44.727
And so, I've heard Doug tell
the story many times

00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:47.037
of his personal transformation

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:50.407
and the breakthrough design
that happened from it,

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:53.542
but I've never really seen him
tell the story of the little girl

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.003
without a tear in his eye.

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:57.580
Doug's story takes place in a hospital.

00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:00.460
I know a thing or two about hospitals.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.900
A few years ago, I felt a lump
on the side of my neck.

00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:08.666
It was my turn in the MRI machine.

00:09:09.224 --> 00:09:12.184
It was cancer, it was the bad kind.

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:15.367
I was told I had a 40 percent
chance of survival.

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:19.069
So while you're sitting
around with the other patients,

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:20.317
in your pajamas,

00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.369
and everybody's pale and thin --

00:09:22.393 --> 00:09:23.409
(Laughter)

00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:26.698
you know? -- and you're waiting
for your turn to get the gamma rays,

00:09:26.722 --> 00:09:28.374
you think of a lot of things.

00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:30.976
Mostly, you think about:
Am I going to survive?

00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:32.909
And I thought a lot about:

00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:35.851
What was my daughter's life
going to be like without me?

00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:40.174
But you think about other things.

00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:43.184
I thought a lot about:
What was I put on Earth to do?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:46.450
What was my calling? What should I do?

00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:48.671
I was lucky because I had lots of options.

00:09:48.695 --> 00:09:50.654
We'd been working in health and wellness,

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.776
and K-12, and the developing world.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.452
so there were lots of projects
that I could work on.

00:09:55.872 --> 00:09:58.190
But then I decided
and committed at this point,

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.059
to the thing I most wanted to do,

00:10:01.494 --> 00:10:05.185
which was to help as many
people as possible

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:08.341
regain the creative confidence
they lost along their way.

00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:11.906
And if I was going to survive,
that's what I wanted to do.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.391
I survived, just so you know.

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:15.486
(Laughter)

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:22.129
(Applause)

00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:26.148
I really believe that when people
gain this confidence --

00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:29.173
and we see it all the time
at the d.school and at IDEO --

00:10:29.197 --> 00:10:31.995
that they actually start
working on the things

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:34.006
that are really important in their lives.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.741
We see people quit what they're doing
and go in new directions.

00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:44.214
We see them come up with more
interesting -- and just more -- ideas,

00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:47.141
so they can choose from better ideas.

00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:49.188
And they just make better decisions.

00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:53.251
I know at TED, you're supposed to have
a change-the-world kind of thing,

00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:55.975
isn't that -- everybody has
a change-the-world thing?

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:59.126
If there is one for me, this is it,
to help this happen.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.890
So I hope you'll join me on my quest,

00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:03.524
you as, kind of, thought leaders.

00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:07.789
It would be really great if you didn't let
people divide the world

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:11.775
into the creatives and the non-creatives,
like it's some God-given thing,

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:16.155
and to have people realize
that they're naturally creative,

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:19.838
and that those natural people
should let their ideas fly;

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:25.101
that they should achieve
what Bandura calls self-efficacy,

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:28.388
that you can do what you set out to do,

00:11:28.412 --> 00:11:32.100
and that you can reach a place
of creative confidence

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.808
and touch the snake.

00:11:33.832 --> 00:11:34.984
Thank you.

00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:41.323
(Applause)
