00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Can I ask you to please recall a time

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
when you really loved something --

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
a movie, an album, a song or a book --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and you recommended it wholeheartedly

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
to someone you also really liked,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and it came back, and the person hated it?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
So, by way of introduction,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that is the exact same state

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I teach high school math.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I sell a product to a market

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
a useful stereotype about you all.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I could give you guys

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
an algebra-two final exam,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and I would expect no higher

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
than a 25 percent pass rate.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And both of these facts say less about you or my students

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
than they do about what we call math education

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
in the U.S. today.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
For example, factoring quadratics with

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
leading coefficients greater than one.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
provided you have a really strong grounding

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
in reasoning. Math reasoning --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
we'll call it the application

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
of math processes to the world around us --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
this is hard to teach.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
This is what we would love students to retain,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
all but ensures they won't retain it.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.260
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to be a math teacher.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So first, five symptoms

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that you're doing math reasoning wrong

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
in your classroom.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
You finish your lecture block

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and immediately you have five hands going up

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Students lack perseverance.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
They lack retention; you find yourself

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
There's an aversion to word problems,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
which describes 99 percent of my students.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And then the other one percent

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
is eagerly looking for the formula

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
to apply in that situation.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
This is really destructive.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
has a really good description for this.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
He swore off creating

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
contemporary drama,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
shows set in the present day,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
because he saw that when people fill their mind

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
in such a way that they expect simple problems.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
three commercial breaks and a laugh track.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And I'll put it to all of you,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I am very concerned about this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I'm doing bad things

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
to my own future and well-being

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
when I teach this way.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and patient problem solving,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
(Laughter)

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
It applies equally to math.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Notice, first of all here,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
each of which will figure into a formula

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
somewhere, eventually,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
which the student will then compute.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I believe in real life.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
that was worth solving

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
where you knew all of the given information in advance;

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
or you didn't have sufficient information

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and had to go find some.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
we have problems like this right here

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
it helpfully explains to you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
You could literally, I mean this,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It's about defining steepness and slope

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
using a ski lift.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
and presented to the student all at once,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
how that creates this impatient problem solving.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
I'll define them here: You have the visual.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
You also have the mathematical structure,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
talking about grids, measurements, labels,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
points, axes, that sort of thing.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
which section is the steepest.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So I hope you can see.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
but we're paving a smooth, straight path

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
from one to the other

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and congratulating our students for how well

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
they can step over the small cracks in the way.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
That's all we're doing here.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and build them up with students,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
So right here I start with the visual,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and I immediately ask the question:

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Which section is the steepest?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And this starts conversation

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So you get people arguing against each other,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
friend versus friend,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
in pairs, journaling, whatever.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And then eventually we realize

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
it's getting annoying to talk about

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
or the skier just above the mid line.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And we realize how great would it be

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
to talk about them more easily.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And then and only then,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
we throw down that mathematical structure.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
The math serves the conversation,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
the conversation doesn't serve the math.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But if you need to,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
your students can then develop those substeps together.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
who, I believe, has paid his dues.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
we just give problems to students;

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
So 90 percent of what I do

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
with my five hours of prep time per week

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
is to take fairly compelling elements

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
of problems like this from my textbook

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And here's how it works.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I like this question. It's about a water tank.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Students have to develop those,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
they have to formulate those.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Students need to decide, "All right, well,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So now we have a water tank.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And because this is the 21st century

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
not in terms of line art or clip art

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
that you so often see in textbooks,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
we go out and we take a picture of it.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
So now we have the real deal.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
How long will it take it to fill it up?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And then even better is we take a video,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
a video of someone filling it up.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
It's tedious.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and they're all wondering at some point or another,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.260
(Laughter)

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
because, like the intro,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
because someone else has the formula;

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
so I won't talk about it.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Everyone's filled something up with water before,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
joining the conversation.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
and kids have bought in here.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And then we follow the process I've described.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And the best part here, or one of the better parts

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
in the back of the teacher's edition.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
(Laughter)

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
And that's terrifying,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
because the theoretical models that always work out

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that's great, but

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
it's scary to talk about sources of error

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But those conversations have been so valuable,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
among the most valuable.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So I'm here to report some really fun games

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
with students who come pre-installed

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
with these viruses day one of the class.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
These are the kids who now, one semester in,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I can put something on the board,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
totally new, totally foreign,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
than they would have at the start of the year,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
which is just so fun.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
We're no longer averse to word problems,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
because we've redefined what a word problem is.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
We're no longer intimidated by math,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
because we're slowly redefining what math is.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
This has been a lot of fun.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
because it brings the real world into your classroom

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
in high resolution and full color;

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
to ask the shortest question you possibly can

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
to let students build the problem,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
because Einstein said so;

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
It's buying you out of your obligation,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
is because we have the tools to create

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and the tools to distribute it

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
freely under open licenses

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
which, wow.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
I put this problem on my blog recently:

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
the one that has one cart and 19 items

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
which is just bizarre, right?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And from all of this, I can only conclude

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
that people, not just students,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
are really hungry for this.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Math makes sense of the world.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Math is the vocabulary

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
for your own intuition.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
insist on better math curriculum.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)
