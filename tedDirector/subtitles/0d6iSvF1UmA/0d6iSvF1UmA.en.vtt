00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
Good evening.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.576
My journey to this stage

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.216
began when I came to America

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.080
at the age of 17.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.656
You see, I'm one
of the 84 million Americans

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.976
who are immigrants

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.416
or children of immigrants.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.256
Each of us has a dream when we come here,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.296
a dream that usually has to be rewritten

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.640
and always has to be repurposed.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.456
I was one of the lucky ones.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.296
My revised dream
led me to the work I do today:

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.256
training immigrants
to run for public office

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.440
and leading a movement
for inclusive democracy.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.456
But I don't want you to think
it was a cakewalk,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.760
that America opened its arms wide
and welcomed me.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.840
It's still not doing that.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.256
And I've learned
a few lessons along the way

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.896
that I wanted to share with you,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.896
because I think that together

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.616
we can make American democracy

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280
better and stronger.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.976
I was born in India,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.976
the world's largest democracy,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.256
and when I was four,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.096
my family moved to Belize,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.560
the world's smallest democracy perhaps.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.136
And at the age of 17,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.016
I moved to the United States,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.600
the world's greatest democracy.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.360
I came because I wanted
to study English literature.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.936
You see, as a child,
I buried my nose in books,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.616
and I thought, why not make a living
doing that as an adult?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.096
But after I graduated from college

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.256
and got a graduate degree,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.800
I found myself moving
from one less ideal job to another.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.016
Maybe it was the optimism
that I had about America

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.936
that made me take a while to understand

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.216
that things were not going to change.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.136
The door that I thought was open

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.056
was actually just slightly ajar --

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.016
this door of America

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.136
that would open wide
if you had the right name,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.776
the right skin color,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.656
the right networks,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.416
but could just slam in your face

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.536
if you had the wrong religion,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.400
the wrong immigration status,

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.920
the wrong skin color.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.456
And I just couldn't accept that.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.400
So I started a career
as a social entrepreneur,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.496
starting an organization
for young people like myself --

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.640
I was young at the time
that I started it --

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.840
who traced their heritage
to the Indian subcontinent.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.840
In that work, I became and advocate
for South Asians and other immigrants.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.600
I lobbied members of Congress
on policy issues.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.920
I volunteered on election day
to do exit polling.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.800
But I couldn't vote,
and I couldn't run for office.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.816
So in 2000, when it was announced

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.656
that the citizenship application fee
was going to more than double

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.376
from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.560
I decided it was time to apply
before I could no longer afford it.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.536
I filled out a long application,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880
answering questions about
my current and my past affiliations.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.576
And once the application was submitted,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.856
there were fingerprints to be taken,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.056
a test to study for,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.680
endless hours of waiting in line.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600
You might call it extreme vetting.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.016
And then in December of 2000,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.016
I joined hundreds of other immigrants

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.176
in a hall in Brooklyn

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.536
where we pledged our loyalty

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.216
to a country that we had
long considered home.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.856
My journey from international student
to American citizen took 16 years,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.200
a short timeline when you compare it
to other immigrant stories.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.176
And soon after I had taken
that formal step

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.136
to becoming an American,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.016
the attacks of September 11, 2001,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.200
changed the immigration landscape
for decades to come.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.816
My city, New York City,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.216
was reeling and healing,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.616
and in the midst of it,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.440
we were in an election cycle.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.896
Two things happened

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.600
as we coped with loss and recovery
in New York City.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.400
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg
mayor of New York City.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.776
We also adopted by ballot referendum

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
the Office of Immigrant Affairs
for the City of New York.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.360
Five months after that election,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.920
the newly elected mayor

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.896
appointed me the first Commissioner
of Immigrant Affairs

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.200
for this newly established office.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.320
I want you to come back to that time.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.800
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.296
I had basically floundered
in various jobs in America

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.856
before I started
a community-based organization

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.080
in a church basement in Queens.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.360
The attacks of September 11
sent shock waves through my community.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.296
People who were members of my family,
young people I had worked with,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.136
were experiencing harassment

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.560
at schools, at workplaces
and in airports.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.200
And now I was going
to represent their concerns

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.200
in government.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.480
No job felt more perfect for me.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.600
And here are two things I learned
when I became Commissioner.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.056
First, well-meaning New Yorkers

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.216
who were in city government
holding government positions

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.720
had no idea how scared immigrants were

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.920
of law enforcement.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.056
Most of us don't really know
the difference, do we,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.440
between a sheriff
and local police and the FBI.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.896
And most of us,
when we see someone in uniform

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.816
going through our neighborhoods

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.240
feel curiosity, if not concern.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.016
So if you're an undocumented parent,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.056
every day when you say
goodbye to your child,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.816
send them off to school and go to work,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.816
you don't know what the chances are

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.416
that you're going to see them
at the end of the day.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.760
Because a raid at your workplace,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.136
a chance encounter with local police

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.840
could change the course
of your life forever.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.216
The second thing I learned
is that when people like me,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.800
who understood that fear,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.816
who had learned a new language,
who had navigated new systems,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.176
when people like us
were sitting at the table,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.320
we advocated for our communities' needs
in a way that no one else could or would.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.440
I understood what that feeling
of fear was like.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.376
People in my family were experiencing it.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.816
Young people I had worked with
were being harassed,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.816
not just by classmates,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.600
but also by their teachers.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.336
My husband, then boyfriend,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.576
thought twice before he put
a backpack on or grew a beard

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240
because he traveled so much.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.256
What I learned in 2001
was that my vote mattered

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.560
but that my voice
and vantage point also mattered.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.336
And it's these three things --

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.496
immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points --

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.480
that I think can help
make our democracy stronger.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.056
We actually have the power

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.056
to change the outcome of elections,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.216
to introduce new issues
into the policy debate

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.136
and to change the face
of the pale, male, stale leadership

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.960
that we have in our country today.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.176
So how do we do that?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.776
Well, let's talk first about votes.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.456
It will come as no surprise to you

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.240
that the majority of voters
in America are white.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.936
But it might surprise you to know

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.000
that one in three voters
are black, Latino or Asian.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.376
But here's the thing:

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.680
it doesn't just matter who can vote,
it matters who does vote.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.856
So in 2012, half of the Latino
and Asian-American voters

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.120
did not vote.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.696
And these votes matter
not just in presidential elections.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.800
They matter in local and state elections.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.456
In 2015, Lan Diep,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.800
the eldest son of political
refugees from Vietnam,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.320
ran for a seat
in the San Jose City Council.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.640
He lost that election by 13 votes.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.856
This year, he dusted off
those campaign shoes

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.720
and went back to run for that seat,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.480
and this time he won, by 12 votes.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.920
Every one of our votes matters.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.816
And when people like Lan
are sitting at the policy table,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.176
they can make a difference.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.976
We need those voices.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.256
We need those voices

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.376
in part because American leadership

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.240
does not look like America's residents.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.880
There are over 500,000
local and state offices in America.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.136
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices
are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.920
the two largest immigrant groups
in our country.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.936
In the city of Yakima, Washington,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.576
where 49 percent
of the population is Latino,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.160
there has never been a Latino
on the city council until this year.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.496
Three newly elected Latinas
joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.216
One of them is Carmen Méndez.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.976
She is a first-generation college student.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.816
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.256
and partly in Yakima, Washington.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.720
She's a single mother,
a community advocate.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.016
Her voice on the Yakima City Council

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.616
is advocating on behalf
of the Latino community

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.896
and of all Yakima residents.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.496
And she's a role model for her daughter

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.800
and other Latinas.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.960
But the third most untapped resource
in American democracy

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.280
is the vantage point
that immigrants bring.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.240
We have fought to be here.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.416
We have come for economic
and educational opportunity.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.776
We have come for political
and religious freedom.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.960
We have come in the pursuit of love.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.016
That dedication,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.840
that commitment to America

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.320
we also bring to public service.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.656
People like Athena Salman,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.176
who just last week won the primary

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.576
for a seat in the Arizona State House.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.696
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.936
and moved to Chicago,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.416
where he met her mother.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.496
Her mother is part Italian,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.936
part Mexican and part German.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.600
Together they moved to Arizona
and built a life.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.936
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.496
is going to fight for things
like education funding

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.056
that will help give
families like hers a leg up

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.096
so they can achieve
the financial stability

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.960
that we all are looking for.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.376
Immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.296
are what we all need to work
to include in American democracy.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.920
It's not just my work. It's also yours.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.496
And it's not going to be easy.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.176
We never know

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.400
what putting a new factor
into an equation will do.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.760
And it's a little scary.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.696
You're scared that I'm going
to take away your place at the table,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.200
and I'm scared that I'm never
going to get a place at the table.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.616
And we're all scared

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.720
that we're going to lose this country
that we know and love.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.696
I'm scared you're going
to take it away from me,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.200
and you're scared
I'm going to take it away from you.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.576
Look, it's been a rough election year,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.976
a reminder that people
with my immigration history

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.400
could be removed at the whim of a leader.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.736
But I have fought to be in this country

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.696
and I continue to do so every day.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.816
So my optimism never wavers,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.376
because I know that there are
millions of immigrants just like me,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.360
in front of me,
behind me and all around me.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.880
It's our country, too.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.136
Thank you.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.760
(Applause)
