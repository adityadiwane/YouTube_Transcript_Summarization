00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.032
This is a lot of ones and zeros.

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:18.131
It's what we call binary information.

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.573
This is how computers talk.

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:21.502
It's how they store information.

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:23.128
It's how computers think.

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:24.747
It's how computers do

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:27.129
everything it is that computers do.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:29.176
I'm a cybersecurity researcher,

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:31.246
which means my job is to sit
down with this information

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:32.930
and try to make sense of it,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.683
to try to understand what all
the ones and zeroes mean.

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:37.526
Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:39.760
about the ones and zeros
I have on the screen here.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.443
We're not just talking about a
few pages of ones and zeros.

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:45.052
We're talking about billions and billions

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:46.385
of ones and zeros,

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:49.026
more than anyone could possibly comprehend.

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:50.885
Now, as exciting as that sounds,

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:53.377
when I first started doing cyber —

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.120
(Laughter) —

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.123
when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.596
that sifting through ones and zeros

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.890
was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.910
because in my mind, cyber

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.591
was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.939
it was keeping people's Myspace
pages from being hacked,

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.124
and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:15.875
it was keeping someone's credit
card information from being stolen.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.238
Those are important things,

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:19.996
but that's not how I wanted to spend my life.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.930
But after 30 minutes of work

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.283
as a defense contractor,

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.073
I soon found out that my idea of cyber

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:27.942
was a little bit off.

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.887
In fact, in terms of national security,

00:01:29.887 --> 00:01:31.958
keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.144
was surprisingly low on their priority list.

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:36.445
And the reason for that is cyber

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:40.238
is so much bigger than any one of those things.

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:43.063
Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives,

00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:46.123
because computers are an
integral part of all of our lives,

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:48.075
even if you don't own a computer.

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:50.721
Computers control everything in your car,

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.601
from your GPS to your airbags.

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:53.917
They control your phone.

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:55.088
They're the reason you can call 911

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:56.884
and get someone on the other line.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:59.678
They control our nation's entire infrastructure.

00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:01.354
They're the reason you have electricity,

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.692
heat, clean water, food.

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:05.593
Computers control our military equipment,

00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:07.270
everything from missile silos to satellites

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.184
to nuclear defense networks.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:13.173
All of these things are made possible

00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:14.589
because of computers,

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.572
and therefore because of cyber,

00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:18.076
and when something goes wrong,

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.194
cyber can make all of these things impossible.

00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:22.779
But that's where I step in.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.719
A big part of my job is defending all of these things,

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.381
keeping them working,

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.709
but once in a while, part of my
job is to break one of these things,

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.105
because cyber isn't just about defense,

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.378
it's also about offense.

00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:35.954
We're entering an age where we talk about

00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:37.415
cyberweapons.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:40.550
In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.171
that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.

00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:45.971
Warfare.

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:47.900
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.651
On the one hand, it means we have whole new front

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:52.394
on which we need to defend ourselves,

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:53.879
but on the other hand,

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.721
it means we have a whole new way to attack,

00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:57.580
a whole new way to stop evil people

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.807
from doing evil things.

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.618
So let's consider an example of this

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:03.307
that's completely theoretical.

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:05.565
Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:07.633
and he wants to do this again and again

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.084
in the future.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.924
So he doesn't want to be in
that building when it explodes.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:13.442
He's going to use a cell phone

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:15.777
as a remote detonator.

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:17.648
Now, it used to be the only way we had

00:03:17.648 --> 00:03:19.284
to stop this terrorist

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.957
was with a hail of bullets and a car chase,

00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:24.289
but that's not necessarily true anymore.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:25.852
We're entering an age where we can stop him

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:26.962
with the press of a button

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.969
from 1,000 miles away,

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.558
because whether he knew it or not,

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.269
as soon as he decided to use his cell phone,

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.403
he stepped into the realm of cyber.

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:38.520
A well-crafted cyber attack
could break into his phone,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.669
disable the overvoltage protections on his battery,

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.424
drastically overload the circuit,

00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:44.781
cause the battery to overheat, and explode.

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:47.227
No more phone, no more detonator,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.150
maybe no more terrorist,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.181
all with the press of a button

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.861
from a thousand miles away.

00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.612
So how does this work?

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:56.880
It all comes back to those ones and zeros.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.885
Binary information makes your phone work,

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.469
and used correctly, it can make your phone explode.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.941
So when you start to look at
cyber from this perspective,

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:09.104
spending your life sifting through binary information

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.521
starts to seem kind of exciting.

00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:14.167
But here's the catch: This is hard,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.852
really, really hard,

00:04:15.852 --> 00:04:17.686
and here's why.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:20.452
Think about everything you have on your cell phone.

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:22.415
You've got the pictures you've taken.

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:24.201
You've got the music you listen to.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.849
You've got your contacts list,

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.474
your email, and probably 500 apps

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:30.475
you've never used in your entire life,

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:34.462
and behind all of this is the software, the code,

00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:35.842
that controls your phone,

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.498
and somewhere, buried inside of that code,

00:04:38.498 --> 00:04:41.046
is a tiny piece that controls your battery,

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.917
and that's what I'm really after,

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:46.603
but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,

00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:48.134
and it's all just mixed together.

00:04:48.134 --> 00:04:51.679
In cyber, we call this finding a
needle in a stack of needles,

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:54.028
because everything pretty much looks alike.

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:55.760
I'm looking for one key piece,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.994
but it just blends in with everything else.

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.246
So let's step back from this theoretical situation

00:05:01.246 --> 00:05:03.590
of making a terrorist's phone explode,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.406
and look at something that actually happened to me.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.749
Pretty much no matter what I do,

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:09.191
my job always starts with sitting down

00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.563
with a whole bunch of binary information,

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.290
and I'm always looking for one key piece

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.277
to do something specific.

00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:17.354
In this case, I was looking for a very advanced,

00:05:17.354 --> 00:05:18.872
very high-tech piece of code

00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:20.087
that I knew I could hack,

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:21.801
but it was somewhere buried

00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.827
inside of a billion ones and zeroes.

00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:25.405
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know

00:05:25.405 --> 00:05:27.096
quite what I was looking for.

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:28.292
I didn't know quite what it would look like,

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:31.210
which makes finding it really, really hard.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.249
When I have to do that, what I have to do

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.591
is basically look at various pieces

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.314
of this binary information,

00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:39.516
try to decipher each piece, and see if it might be

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:40.740
what I'm after.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.365
So after a while, I thought I had found the piece

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:43.702
I was looking for.

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:45.806
I thought maybe this was it.

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:47.838
It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.756
I couldn't tell what those
ones and zeros represented.

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:54.130
So I spent some time trying to put this together,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.800
but wasn't having a whole lot of luck,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.986
and finally I decided,

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.595
I'm going to get through this,

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:00.106
I'm going to come in on a weekend,

00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:01.446
and I'm not going to leave

00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:03.158
until I figure out what this represents.

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:05.324
So that's what I did. I came
in on a Saturday morning,

00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:08.969
and about 10 hours in, I sort of
had all the pieces to the puzzle.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.361
I just didn't know how they fit together.

00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:13.151
I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:15.218
At the 15-hour mark,

00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:17.820
I started to get a better picture of what was there,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.592
but I had a creeping suspicion

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:21.181
that what I was looking at

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:24.104
was not at all related to what I was looking for.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.591
By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:30.355
very slowly — (Laughter) —

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:31.621
and I was pretty sure I was going down

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:33.560
the wrong path at this point,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.811
but I wasn't going to give up.

00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:38.645
After 30 hours in the lab,

00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:40.906
I figured out exactly what I was looking at,

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:43.724
and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:45.423
I spent 30 hours piecing together

00:06:45.423 --> 00:06:48.145
the ones and zeros that
formed a picture of a kitten.

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:49.940
(Laughter)

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.746
I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.584
that had nothing at all to do

00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:57.571
with what I was trying to accomplish.

00:06:57.571 --> 00:07:01.434
So I was frustrated, I was exhausted.

00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:04.660
After 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.890
But instead of just going home

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.420
and calling it quits, I took a step back

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.961
and asked myself, what went wrong here?

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:14.173
How could I make such a stupid mistake?

00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:15.571
I'm really pretty good at this.

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:16.890
I do this for a living.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.038
So what happened?

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.813
Well I thought, when you're
looking at information at this level,

00:07:21.813 --> 00:07:24.640
it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.384
It's easy to not see the forest through the trees.

00:07:26.384 --> 00:07:28.548
It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.310
and waste a tremendous amount of time

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.130
doing the wrong thing.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.730
But I had this epiphany.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.729
We were looking at the data completely incorrectly

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.219
since day one.

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.322
This is how computers think, ones and zeros.

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:41.714
It's not how people think,

00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:44.028
but we've been trying to adapt our minds

00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.373
to think more like computers

00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:47.970
so that we can understand this information.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.920
Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.568
we should have been making the problem

00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:52.537
fit our minds,

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:54.646
because our brains have a tremendous potential

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:57.732
for analyzing huge amounts of information,

00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:59.029
just not like this.

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:00.496
So what if we could unlock that potential

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.023
just by translating this

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.871
to the right kind of information?

00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:06.065
So with these ideas in mind,

00:08:06.065 --> 00:08:07.683
I sprinted out of my basement lab at work

00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:08.990
to my basement lab at home,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.986
which looked pretty much the same.

00:08:10.986 --> 00:08:12.810
The main difference is, at work,

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.389
I'm surrounded by cyber materials,

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.994
and cyber seemed to be the
problem in this situation.

00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:20.347
At home, I'm surrounded by
everything else I've ever learned.

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:22.219
So I poured through every book I could find,

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:23.551
every idea I'd ever encountered,

00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:25.697
to see how could we translate a problem

00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:28.829
from one domain to something completely different?

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:30.223
The biggest question was,

00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:32.191
what do we want to translate it to?

00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:34.303
What do our brains do perfectly naturally

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:36.181
that we could exploit?

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.470
My answer was vision.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.619
We have a tremendous capability
to analyze visual information.

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:44.202
We can combine color gradients, depth cues,

00:08:44.202 --> 00:08:45.990
all sorts of these different signals

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.385
into one coherent picture of the world around us.

00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:49.792
That's incredible.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:51.173
So if we could find a way to translate

00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:53.359
these binary patterns to visual signals,

00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:55.191
we could really unlock the power of our brains

00:08:55.191 --> 00:08:57.901
to process this stuff.

00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.744
So I started looking at the binary information,

00:08:59.744 --> 00:09:00.834
and I asked myself, what do I do

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:02.710
when I first encounter something like this?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.333
And the very first thing I want to do,

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:05.692
the very first question I want to answer,

00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:06.970
is what is this?

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.498
I don't care what it does, how it works.

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:11.977
All I want to know is, what is this?

00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:13.652
And the way I can figure that out

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.335
is by looking at chunks,

00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:17.788
sequential chunks of binary information,

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:20.690
and I look at the relationships
between those chunks.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.462
When I gather up enough of these sequences,

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:24.466
I begin to get an idea of exactly

00:09:24.466 --> 00:09:27.100
what this information must be.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.284
So let's go back to that

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:30.374
blow up the terrorist's phone situation.

00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:32.577
This is what English text looks like

00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:33.890
at a binary level.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.216
This is what your contacts list would look like

00:09:36.216 --> 00:09:37.776
if I were examining it.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.010
It's really hard to analyze this at this level,

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.114
but if we take those same binary chunks

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.296
that I would be trying to find,

00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:45.060
and instead translate that

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.980
to a visual representation,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.777
translate those relationships,

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.333
this is what we get.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.247
This is what English text looks like

00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:54.918
from a visual abstraction perspective.

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:56.058
All of a sudden,

00:09:56.058 --> 00:09:57.493
it shows us all the same information

00:09:57.493 --> 00:09:58.665
that was in the ones and zeros,

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.986
but show us it in an entirely different way,

00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:02.703
a way that we can immediately comprehend.

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:05.668
We can instantly see all of the patterns here.

00:10:05.668 --> 00:10:08.260
It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.514
but hours, days, to pick them out

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:11.834
in ones and zeros.

00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:13.570
It takes minutes for anybody to learn

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.235
what these patterns represent here,

00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:17.482
but years of experience in cyber

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:19.136
to learn what those same patterns represent

00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:20.722
in ones and zeros.

00:10:20.722 --> 00:10:22.384
So this piece is caused by

00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:24.408
lower case letters followed by lower case letters

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:26.175
inside of that contact list.

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:27.516
This is upper case by upper case,

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:30.201
upper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:32.887
This is caused by spaces. This
is caused by carriage returns.

00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:34.395
We can go through every little detail

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:37.361
of the binary information in seconds,

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:40.895
as opposed to weeks, months, at this level.

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:42.407
This is what an image looks like

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:44.283
from your cell phone.

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:45.296
But this is what it looks like

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.187
in a visual abstraction.

00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:49.172
This is what your music looks like,

00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:51.375
but here's its visual abstraction.

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:53.135
Most importantly for me,

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:56.410
this is what the code on your cell phone looks like.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.567
This is what I'm after in the end,

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:00.707
but this is its visual abstraction.

00:11:00.707 --> 00:11:03.216
If I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.

00:11:03.216 --> 00:11:05.835
I could spend weeks trying to find this

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:07.012
in ones and zeros,

00:11:07.012 --> 00:11:08.796
but it takes me seconds to pick out

00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:12.100
a visual abstraction like this.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.592
One of those most remarkable parts about all of this

00:11:14.592 --> 00:11:17.424
is it gives us an entirely new way to understand

00:11:17.424 --> 00:11:20.663
new information, stuff that we haven't seen before.

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:23.167
So I know what English looks like at a binary level,

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:25.277
and I know what its visual abstraction looks like,

00:11:25.277 --> 00:11:28.592
but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.

00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:30.392
It would take me weeks just to figure out

00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:33.389
what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.140
but because our brains can instantly pick up

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.957
and recognize these subtle patterns inside

00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:39.445
of these visual abstractions,

00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:41.277
we can unconsciously apply those

00:11:41.277 --> 00:11:42.850
in new situations.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.332
So this is what Russian looks like

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:45.912
in a visual abstraction.

00:11:45.912 --> 00:11:47.716
Because I know what one language looks like,

00:11:47.716 --> 00:11:49.292
I can recognize other languages

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.162
even when I'm not familiar with them.

00:11:51.162 --> 00:11:52.948
This is what a photograph looks like,

00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:54.835
but this is what clip art looks like.

00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:57.390
This is what the code on your phone looks like,

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.097
but this is what the code on
your computer looks like.

00:12:00.097 --> 00:12:01.961
Our brains can pick up on these patterns

00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:03.912
in ways that we never could have

00:12:03.912 --> 00:12:06.408
from looking at raw ones and zeros.

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:08.264
But we've really only scratched the surface

00:12:08.264 --> 00:12:10.401
of what we can do with this approach.

00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:12.079
We've only begun to unlock the capabilities

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.394
of our minds to process visual information.

00:12:15.394 --> 00:12:17.384
If we take those same concepts and translate them

00:12:17.384 --> 00:12:19.035
into three dimensions instead,

00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:22.230
we find entirely new ways of
making sense of information.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.715
In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.

00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:26.535
we can see the cross associated with code.

00:12:26.535 --> 00:12:28.467
We can see cubes associated with text.

00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:30.943
We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.

00:12:30.943 --> 00:12:33.073
Things that would take us weeks,

00:12:33.073 --> 00:12:35.267
months to find in ones and zeroes,

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:37.070
are immediately apparent

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.340
in some sort of visual abstraction,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.472
and as we continue to go through this

00:12:40.472 --> 00:12:42.488
and throw more and more information at it,

00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:44.769
what we find is that we're capable of processing

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:47.185
billions of ones and zeros

00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:48.353
in a matter of seconds

00:12:48.353 --> 00:12:51.587
just by using our brain's built-in ability

00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:53.541
to analyze patterns.

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:55.844
So this is really nice and helpful,

00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:58.203
but all this tells me is what I'm looking at.

00:12:58.203 --> 00:12:59.687
So at this point, based on visual patterns,

00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:02.096
I can find the code on the phone.

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:04.761
But that's not enough to blow up a battery.

00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:06.329
The next thing I need to find is the code

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:08.090
that controls the battery, but we're back

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.821
to the needle in a stack of needles problem.

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.210
That code looks pretty much like all the other code

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.448
on that system.

00:13:14.448 --> 00:13:16.849
So I might not be able to find the
code that controls the battery,

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:18.860
but there's a lot of things
that are very similar to that.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.714
You have code that controls your screen,

00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:22.930
that controls your buttons,
that controls your microphones,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.858
so even if I can't find the code for the battery,

00:13:24.858 --> 00:13:27.103
I bet I can find one of those things.

00:13:27.103 --> 00:13:29.808
So the next step in my binary analysis process

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.039
is to look at pieces of information

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.057
that are similar to each other.

00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:37.040
It's really, really hard to do at a binary level,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.683
but if we translate those similarities
to a visual abstraction instead,

00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:43.121
I don't even have to sift through the raw data.

00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:45.276
All I have to do is wait for the image to light up

00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:47.512
to see when I'm at similar pieces.

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:50.540
I follow these strands of similarity
like a trail of bread crumbs

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.646
to find exactly what I'm looking for.

00:13:53.646 --> 00:13:55.380
So at this point in the process,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.698
I've located the code

00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:58.383
responsible for controlling your battery,

00:13:58.383 --> 00:14:00.959
but that's still not enough to blow up a phone.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.523
The last piece of the puzzle

00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:05.202
is understanding how that code

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:06.404
controls your battery.

00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:08.792
For this, I need to identify

00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:10.508
very subtle, very detailed relationships

00:14:10.508 --> 00:14:12.597
within that binary information,

00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:14.352
another very hard thing to do

00:14:14.352 --> 00:14:16.664
when looking at ones and zeros.

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:18.060
But if we translate that information

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.240
into a physical representation,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.256
we can sit back and let our
visual cortex do all the hard work.

00:14:23.256 --> 00:14:24.990
It can find all the detailed patterns,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.010
all the important pieces, for us.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.603
It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:32.537
work together to control that battery.

00:14:32.537 --> 00:14:35.541
All of this can be done in a matter of hours,

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.897
whereas the same process

00:14:36.897 --> 00:14:39.819
would have taken months in the past.

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:41.008
This is all well and good

00:14:41.008 --> 00:14:43.950
in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.797
I wanted to find out if this would really work

00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:49.426
in the work I do every day.

00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:52.481
So I was playing around with these same concepts

00:14:52.481 --> 00:14:55.505
with some of the data I've looked at in the past,

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:57.997
and yet again, I was trying to find

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.205
a very detailed, specific piece of code

00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:03.800
inside of a massive piece of binary information.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.573
So I looked at it at this level,

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:07.523
thinking I was looking at the right thing,

00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:09.844
only to see this doesn't have

00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:11.584
the connectivity I would have expected

00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:13.489
for the code I was looking for.

00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:16.092
In fact, I'm not really sure what this is,

00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:17.104
but when I stepped back a level

00:15:17.104 --> 00:15:18.819
and looked at the similarities within the code

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:21.113
I saw, this doesn't have similarities

00:15:21.113 --> 00:15:22.604
like any code that exists out there.

00:15:22.604 --> 00:15:24.829
I can't even be looking at code.

00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:27.215
In fact, from this perspective,

00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:29.263
I could tell, this isn't code.

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:31.311
This is an image of some sort.

00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.993
And from here, I can see,

00:15:32.993 --> 00:15:35.904
it's not just an image, this is a photograph.

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:37.296
Now that I know it's a photograph,

00:15:37.296 --> 00:15:40.226
I've got dozens of other
binary translation techniques

00:15:40.226 --> 00:15:42.647
to visualize and understand that information,

00:15:42.647 --> 00:15:45.190
so in a matter of seconds,
we can take this information,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.587
shove it through a dozen other
visual translation techniques

00:15:47.587 --> 00:15:51.318
in order to find out exactly what we were looking at.

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.000
I saw — (Laughter) —

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.456
it was that darn kitten again.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.506
All this is enabled

00:15:57.506 --> 00:15:59.001
because we were able to find a way

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.030
to translate a very hard problem

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.542
to something our brains do very naturally.

00:16:03.542 --> 00:16:05.780
So what does this mean?

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.325
Well, for kittens, it means

00:16:07.325 --> 00:16:09.742
no more hiding in ones and zeros.

00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:13.045
For me, it means no more wasted weekends.

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:15.657
For cyber, it means we have a radical new way

00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:18.622
to tackle the most impossible problems.

00:16:18.622 --> 00:16:20.434
It means we have a new weapon

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:22.850
in the evolving theater of cyber warfare,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.270
but for all of us,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.745
it means that cyber engineers

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:27.891
now have the ability to become first responders

00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:30.474
in emergency situations.

00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:31.521
When seconds count,

00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.930
we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.930
Thank you.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.892
(Applause)
