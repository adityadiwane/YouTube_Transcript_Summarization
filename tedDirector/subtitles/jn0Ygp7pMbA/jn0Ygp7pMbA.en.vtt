00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.213
Three and a half years ago,

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:17.463
I made one of the best decisions of my life.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.526
As my New Year's resolution,

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:23.765
I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.790
and learned to eat mindfully.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.673
Now I eat whenever I'm hungry,

00:00:30.673 --> 00:00:33.736
and I've lost 10 pounds.

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:36.273
This was me at age 13,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:38.813
when I started my first diet.

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:41.825
I look at that picture now, and I think,

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.659
you did not need a diet,

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.330
you needed a fashion consult.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.737
(Laughter)

00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:51.806
But I thought I needed to lose weight,

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.268
and when I gained it back,

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:57.196
of course I blamed myself.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.703
And for the next three decades,

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:02.458
I was on and off various diets.

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.530
No matter what I tried,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.361
the weight I'd lost always came back.

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.962
I'm sure many of you know the feeling.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.523
As a neuroscientist,

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:15.337
I wondered, why is this so hard?

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:17.897
Obviously, how much you weigh depends on

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:20.487
how much you eat and how much energy you burn.

00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:22.703
What most people don't realize

00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:24.516
is that hunger and energy use

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:26.620
are controlled by the brain,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.135
mostly without your awareness.

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:33.695
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.911
and that is a good thing,

00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:38.097
because your conscious mind --

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.964
how do we put this politely? --

00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:43.239
it's easily distracted.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.944
It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe

00:01:45.944 --> 00:01:48.584
when you get caught up in a movie.

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:50.601
You don't forget how to walk

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.516
because you're thinking about
what to have for dinner.

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:55.500
Your brain also has its own sense

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.265
of what you should weigh,

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.327
no matter what you consciously believe.

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:02.367
This is called your set point,

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.033
but that's a misleading term,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.743
because it's actually a range

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:08.307
of about 10 or 15 pounds.

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:11.530
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.598
up and down within that range,

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:18.003
but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.030
The hypothalamus, the part of the brain

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.943
that regulates body weight,

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:24.366
there are more than a dozen chemical signals

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:26.982
in the brain that tell your body to gain weight,

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:30.666
more than another dozen that
tell your body to lose it,

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.976
and the system works like a thermostat,

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:36.323
responding to signals from the body

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.931
by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:43.657
to keep your weight stable as conditions change.

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:45.759
That's what a thermostat does, right?

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.191
It keeps the temperature in your house the same

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.951
as the weather changes outside.

00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.773
Now you can try to change the temperature

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:58.269
in your house by opening a window in the winter,

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.035
but that's not going to change
the setting on the thermostat,

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:04.234
which will respond by kicking on the furnace

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.671
to warm the place back up.

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.993
Your brain works exactly the same way,

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:13.136
responding to weight loss by using powerful tools

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:14.290
to push your body back

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.320
to what it considers normal.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.295
If you lose a lot of weight,

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:24.620
your brain reacts as if you were starving,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.252
and whether you started out fat or thin,

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:30.217
your brain's response is exactly the same.

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.490
We would love to think that your brain could tell

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.956
whether you need to lose weight or not,

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.091
but it can't.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.984
If you do lose a lot of weight,

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.283
you become hungry,

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.169
and your muscles burn less energy.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.818
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:48.527
has found that people who have lost

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.726
10 percent of their body weight

00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:53.549
burn 250 to 400 calories less

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.057
because their metabolism is suppressed.

00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:58.487
That's a lot of food.

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.711
This means that a successful dieter

00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.879
must eat this much less forever

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.171
than someone of the same weight

00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:07.474
who has always been thin.

00:04:07.474 --> 00:04:09.264
From an evolutionary perspective,

00:04:09.264 --> 00:04:11.808
your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.

00:04:11.808 --> 00:04:14.944
When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival

00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:17.438
depended on conserving energy,

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:19.691
and regaining the weight when food was available

00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:22.798
would have protected them
against the next shortage.

00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:25.325
Over the course of human history,

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:28.327
starvation has been a much bigger problem

00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:30.011
than overeating.

00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:34.242
This may explain a very sad fact:

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:37.071
Set points can go up,

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.943
but they rarely go down.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:42.132
Now, if your mother ever mentioned

00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:44.428
that life is not fair,

00:04:44.428 --> 00:04:47.221
this is the kind of thing she was talking about.

00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:50.259
(Laughter)

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.444
Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.

00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:54.988
Even after you've kept the weight off

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:56.817
for as long as seven years,

00:04:56.817 --> 00:05:00.790
your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.080
If that weight loss had been due to a long famine,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.409
that would be a sensible response.

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.090
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.547
it's not working out so well for many of us.

00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:16.290
That difference between our ancestral past

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.693
and our abundant present

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.982
is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff

00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:23.042
of the University of Ottawa

00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:25.743
would like to take some of his patients back to a time

00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:27.842
when food was less available,

00:05:27.842 --> 00:05:29.543
and it's also the reason

00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.927
that changing the food environment

00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:36.043
is really going to be the most effective solution

00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:38.153
to obesity.

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:41.430
Sadly, a temporary weight gain

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.475
can become permanent.

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:46.109
If you stay at a high weight for too long,

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:48.583
probably a matter of years for most of us,

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:53.021
your brain may decide that that's the new normal.

00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:57.081
Psychologists classify eaters into two groups,

00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:58.699
those who rely on their hunger

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.268
and those who try to control their eating

00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:07.331
through willpower, like most dieters.

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:13.842
Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.

00:06:13.842 --> 00:06:16.025
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:18.656
are less likely to be overweight,

00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:22.358
and they spend less time thinking about food.

00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:26.002
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.865
to overeating in response to advertising,

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:32.728
super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:34.473
And a small indulgence,

00:06:34.473 --> 00:06:37.679
like eating one scoop of ice cream,

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:43.289
is more likely to lead to a food binge

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.186
in controlled eaters.

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:47.113
Children are especially vulnerable

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:50.242
to this cycle of dieting and then binging.

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:53.071
Several long-term studies have shown

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:57.223
that girls who diet in their early teenage years

00:06:57.223 --> 00:07:00.548
are three times more likely to become overweight

00:07:00.548 --> 00:07:02.085
five years later,

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.904
even if they started at a normal weight,

00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:07.553
and all of these studies found

00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:09.860
that the same factors

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.254
that predicted weight gain

00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:16.254
also predicted the development of eating disorders.

00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:17.822
The other factor, by the way,

00:07:17.822 --> 00:07:19.251
those of you who are parents,

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.480
was being teased by family members

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.991
about their weight.

00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:25.827
So don't do that.

00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:27.565
(Laughter)

00:07:27.565 --> 00:07:30.201
I left almost all my graphs at home,

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.494
but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.907
because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.

00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:37.386
(Laughter)

00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:39.734
This is a study that looked at the risk of death

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:41.600
over a 14-year period

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.102
based on four healthy habits:

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:46.222
eating enough fruits and vegetables,

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:48.448
exercise three times a week,

00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:49.824
not smoking,

00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:51.794
and drinking in moderation.

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:53.723
Let's start by looking at the normal weight

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.311
people in the study.

00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.198
The height of the bars is the risk of death,

00:07:57.198 --> 00:07:59.579
and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:00.825
on the horizontal axis

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:02.858
are the number of those healthy habits

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:04.418
that a given person had.

00:08:04.418 --> 00:08:07.407
And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:10.319
the less likely people were to die during the study.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.641
Now let's look at what happens

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:13.487
in overweight people.

00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:15.559
The ones that had no healthy habits

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:17.330
had a higher risk of death.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.094
Adding just one healthy habit

00:08:19.094 --> 00:08:22.556
pulls overweight people back into the normal range.

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:25.298
For obese people with no healthy habits,

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:28.008
the risk is very high, seven times higher

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.144
than the healthiest groups in the study.

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:34.084
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.

00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:36.602
In fact, if you look only at the group

00:08:36.602 --> 00:08:38.876
with all four healthy habits,

00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:41.488
you can see that weight makes very little difference.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:43.544
You can take control of your health

00:08:43.544 --> 00:08:45.418
by taking control of your lifestyle,

00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:46.899
even If you can't lose weight

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:48.635
and keep it off.

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:52.745
Diets don't have very much reliability.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.522
Five years after a diet,

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:57.310
most people have regained the weight.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.792
Forty percent of them have gained even more.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:01.217
If you think about this,

00:09:01.217 --> 00:09:03.564
the typical outcome of dieting

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:05.452
is that you're more likely to gain weight

00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:08.221
in the long run than to lose it.

00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.075
If I've convinced you that dieting

00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:13.104
might be a problem,

00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:15.742
the next question is, what do you do about it?

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:20.198
And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.

00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:22.733
I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:24.725
or take up yoga.

00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:27.277
I'm talking about mindful eating:

00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:30.785
learning to understand your body's signals

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:33.174
so that you eat when you're hungry

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.516
and stop when you're full,

00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:37.694
because a lot of weight gain boils down

00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:40.760
to eating when you're not hungry.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.244
How do you do it?

00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:44.078
Give yourself permission to eat

00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:46.283
as much as you want, and then work on figuring out

00:09:46.283 --> 00:09:48.035
what makes your body feel good.

00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:51.764
Sit down to regular meals without distractions.

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:53.563
Think about how your body feels

00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:55.617
when you start to eat and when you stop,

00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:58.104
and let your hunger decide

00:09:58.104 --> 00:09:59.572
when you should be done.

00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:01.993
It took about a year for me to learn this,

00:10:01.993 --> 00:10:03.764
but it's really been worth it.

00:10:03.764 --> 00:10:06.849
I am so much more relaxed around food

00:10:06.849 --> 00:10:09.712
than I have ever been in my life.

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:12.277
I often don't think about it.

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:15.010
I forget we have chocolate in the house.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.954
It's like aliens have taken over my brain.

00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:20.712
It's just completely different.

00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:23.378
I should say that

00:10:23.378 --> 00:10:26.171
this approach to eating probably
won't make you lose weight

00:10:26.171 --> 00:10:29.088
unless you often eat when you're not hungry,

00:10:29.088 --> 00:10:32.986
but doctors don't know of any approach

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:37.461
that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,

00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:40.831
and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on

00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.990
preventing weight gain

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.213
instead of promoting weight loss.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.749
Let's face it:

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:51.960
If diets worked, we'd all be thin already.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.860
(Laughter)

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.497
Why do we keep doing the same thing

00:10:55.497 --> 00:10:58.380
and expecting different results?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.063
Diets may seem harmless,

00:11:00.063 --> 00:11:03.781
but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.

00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:06.216
At worst, they ruin lives:

00:11:06.216 --> 00:11:08.532
Weight obsession leads to eating disorders,

00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:11.475
especially in young kids.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:16.353
In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls

00:11:16.353 --> 00:11:18.130
say they've been on a diet.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.391
Our daughters have learned to measure their worth

00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:23.494
by the wrong scale.

00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:25.519
Even at its best,

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.247
dieting is a waste of time and energy.

00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:32.469
It takes willpower which you could be using

00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:35.091
to help your kids with their homework

00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:38.707
or to finish that important work project,

00:11:38.707 --> 00:11:42.194
and because willpower is limited,

00:11:42.194 --> 00:11:46.817
any strategy that relies on its consistent application

00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:49.600
is pretty much guaranteed

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.693
to eventually fail you

00:11:51.693 --> 00:11:55.542
when your attention moves on to something else.

00:11:55.542 --> 00:11:59.474
Let me leave you with one last thought.

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:02.377
What if we told all those dieting girls

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:05.378
that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?

00:12:05.378 --> 00:12:07.628
What if we taught them to work with their appetite

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:09.753
instead of fearing it?

00:12:09.753 --> 00:12:13.180
I think most of them would be happier and healthier,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.195
and as adults,

00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:18.968
many of them would probably be thinner.

00:12:18.968 --> 00:12:21.081
I wish someone had told me that

00:12:21.081 --> 00:12:24.502
back when I was 13.

00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:26.508
Thanks.

00:12:26.508 --> 00:12:34.867
(Applause)
