00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.176
Now...

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.280
let's go back in time.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.560
It's 1974.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.520
There is the gallery somewhere

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.600
in the world,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.376
and there is a young girl, age 23,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.920
standing in the middle of the space.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:48.080
In the front of her is a table.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.880
On the table there are 76 objects

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.440
for pleasure and for pain.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.696
Some of the objects are

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.520
a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.640
But also the knife,
the razor blade, the hammer

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.239
and the pistol with one bullet.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.216
There are instructions which say,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.976
"I'm an object.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.336
You can use everything on the table on me.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.440
I'm taking all responsibility --
even killing me.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.520
And the time is six hours."

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
The beginning of this
performance was easy.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.856
People would give me
the glass of water to drink,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.520
they'd give me the rose.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.896
But very soon after,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.416
there was a man who took the scissors
and cut my clothes,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.440
and then they took the thorns of the rose
and stuck them in my stomach.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.280
Somebody took the razor blade
and cut my neck and drank the blood,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.680
and I still have the scar.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.280
The women would tell the men what to do.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.816
And the men didn't rape me
because it was just a normal opening,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.536
and it was all public,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.936
and they were with their wives.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.216
They carried me around
and put me on the table,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.136
and put the knife between my legs.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.800
And somebody took the pistol and bullet
and put it against my temple.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.560
And another person took the pistol
and they started a fight.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.656
And after six hours were finished,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.176
I...

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.336
started walking towards the public.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.576
I was a mess.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920
I was half-naked, I was full of blood
and tears were running down my face.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.880
And everybody escaped, they just ran away.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.280
They could not confront myself,
with myself as a normal human being.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.080
And then --

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.560
what happened

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.720
is I went to the hotel,
it was at two in the morning.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.760
And

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.880
I looked at myself in the mirror,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.320
and I had a piece of gray hair.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.440
Alright --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.040
please take off your blindfolds.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.040
Welcome to the performance world.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.880
First of all, let's explain
what the performance is.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.376
So many artists,
so many different explanations,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.160
but my explanation
for performance is very simple.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.216
Performance is a mental
and physical construction

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.056
that the performer makes
in a specific time

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.376
in a space in front of an audience

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.720
and then energy dialogue happens.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.800
The audience and the performer
make the piece together.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.360
And the difference between
performance and theater is huge.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.696
In the theater, the knife is not a knife

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.640
and the blood is just ketchup.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.576
In the performance,
the blood is the material,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.896
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.816
It's all about being there
in the real time,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.696
and you can't rehearse performance,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.040
because you can't do many
of these types of things twice -- ever.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.856
Which is very important,
the performance is --

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.176
you know, all human beings
are always afraid of very simple things.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.576
We're afraid of suffering,
we're afraid of pain,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.680
we're afraid of mortality.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.496
So what I'm doing --

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.736
I'm staging these kinds of fears
in front of the audience.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.936
I'm using your energy,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.736
and with this energy I can go
and push my body as far as I can.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.336
And then I liberate myself
from these fears.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.656
And I'm your mirror.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.960
If I can do this for myself,
you can do it for you.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.776
After Belgrade, where I was born,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.080
I went to Amsterdam.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.056
And you know, I've been doing performances

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.336
since the last 40 years.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.936
And here I met Ulay,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.336
and he was the person
I actually fell in love with.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.496
And we made, for 12 years,
performances together.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.776
You know the knife
and the pistols and the bullets,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.736
I exchange into love and trust.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.376
So to do this kind work
you have to trust the person completely

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.416
because this arrow
is pointing to my heart.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.776
So, heart beating and adrenaline
is rushing and so on,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.320
is about trust, is about total trust
to another human being.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.536
Our relationship was 12 years,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.416
and we worked on so many subjects,
both male and female energy.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.576
And as every relationship
comes to an end, ours went too.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.256
We didn't make phone calls
like normal human beings do

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.256
and say, you know, "This is over."

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.280
We walked the Great Wall
of China to say goodbye.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.720
I started at the Yellow Sea,
and he started from the Gobi Desert.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.576
We walked, each of us, three months,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.440
two and a half thousand kilometers.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.776
It was the mountains, it was difficult.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.136
It was climbing, it was ruins.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.256
It was, you know, going through
the 12 Chinese provinces,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.096
this was before China was open in '87.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.656
And we succeeded to meet in the middle

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.160
to say goodbye.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.160
And then our relationship stopped.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.960
And now, it completely changed
how I see the public.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.416
And one very important piece
I made in those days

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.416
was "Balkan Baroque."

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.136
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.696
and I wanted to create
some very strong, charismatic image,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.016
something that could serve
for any war at any time,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.056
because the Balkan Wars are now finished,
but there's always some war, somewhere.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.056
So here I am washing

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.856
two and a half thousand
dead, big, bloody cow bones.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.416
You can't wash the blood,
you never can wash shame off the wars.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.016
So I'm washing this six hours, six days,
and wars are coming off these bones,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.280
and becoming possible --
an unbearable smell.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.496
But then something stays in the memory.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.256
I want to show you the one
who really changed my life,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.416
and this was the performance in MoMa,
which I just recently made.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.776
This performance --
when I said to the curator,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.776
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.336
and there will be
an empty chair at the front,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.856
and anybody from the public
can come and sit as long as they want."

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.096
The curator said to me,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.776
"That's ridiculous, you know,
this is New York,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.016
this chair will be empty,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.945
nobody has time to sit in front of you."

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:39.136
(Laughter)

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.056
But I sit for three months.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.016
And I sit everyday, eight hours --

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.416
the opening of the museum --

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.336
and 10 hours on Friday
when the museum is open 10 hours,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.534
and I never move.

00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:51.416
And I removed the table
and I'm still sitting,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.560
and this changed everything.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.296
This performance,
maybe 10 or 15 years ago --

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.736
nothing would have happened.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.656
But the need of people to actually
experience something different,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.776
the public was not anymore the group --

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800
relation was one to one.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.896
I was watching these people,
they would come and sit in front of me,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.616
but they would have to wait
for hours and hours and hours

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.798
to get to this position,

00:08:14.823 --> 00:08:16.376
and finally, they sit.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.960
And what happened?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.576
They are observed by the other people,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.176
they're photographed,
they're filmed by the camera,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.576
they're observed by me

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.760
and they have nowhere to escape
except in themselves.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.816
And that makes a difference.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.656
There was so much pain and loneliness,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.776
there's so much incredible things
when you look in somebody else's eyes,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.776
because in the gaze
with that total stranger,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.800
that you never even say one word --
everything happened.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.176
And I understood when I stood up
from that chair after three months,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.775
I am not the same anymore.

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.576
And I understood
that I have a very strong mission,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.856
that I have to communicate this experience

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.135
to everybody.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:58.976
And this is how, for me, was born the idea

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to have an institute
of immaterial performing arts.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.216
Because thinking about immateriality,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.696
performance is time-based art.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.056
It's not like a painting.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.856
You have the painting on the wall,
the next day it's there.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.576
Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.936
or the story of somebody else telling you,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.896
but you actually missed the whole thing.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.136
So you have to be there.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.056
And in my point,
if you talk about immaterial art,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.456
music is the highest --
absolutely highest art of all,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.256
because it's the most immaterial.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.138
And then after this is performance,
and then everything else.

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:34.696
That's my subjective way.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.616
This institute is going to happen
in Hudson, upstate New York,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.640
and we are trying to build
with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.216
And it's very simple.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.896
If you want to get experience,
you have to give me your time.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.016
You have to sign the contract
before you enter the building,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.896
that you will spend there
a full six hours,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.576
you have to give me your word of honor.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.496
It's something so old-fashioned,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.856
but if you don't respect your own
word of honor and you leave before --

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.096
that's not my problem.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.616
But it's six hours, the experience.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.783
And then after you finish,
you get a certificate of accomplishment,

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:10.856
so get home and frame it if you want.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.896
(Laughter)

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.256
This is orientation hall.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.776
The public comes in, and the first thing
you have to do is dress in lab coats.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.016
It's this importance

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.256
of stepping from being
just a viewer into experimenter.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.696
And then you go to the lockers

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.016
and you put your watch,
your iPhone, your iPod, your computer

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.336
and everything digital, electronic.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.696
And you are getting free time
for yourself for the first time.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.096
Because there is nothing
wrong with technology,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.456
our approach to technology is wrong.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.176
We are losing the time
we have for ourselves.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.496
This is an institute
to actually give you back this time.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.776
So what you do here,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.896
first you start slow walking,
you start slowing down.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.856
You're going back to simplicity.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.496
After slow walking, you're going
to learn how to drink water --

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.160
very simple, drinking water
for maybe half an hour.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.936
After this, you're going to
the magnet chamber,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.856
where you're going to create
some magnet streams on your body.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.336
Then after this,
you go to crystal chamber.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.136
After crystal chamber,
you go to eye-gazing chamber,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.256
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
a chamber where you are lying down.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.736
So it's the three basic positions
of the human body,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.096
sitting, standing and lying.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.656
And slow walking.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.496
And there is a sound chamber.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.856
And then after you've seen all of this,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.023
and prepared yourself
mentally and physically,

00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:31.714
then you are ready to see
something with a long duration,

00:11:31.738 --> 00:11:34.096
like in immaterial art.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.976
It can be music, it can be opera,
it can be a theater piece,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.896
it can be film, it can be video dance.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.736
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.136
In the long duration chairs,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.856
you're transported to the big place
where you're going to see the work.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.096
And if you fall asleep,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.656
which is very possible
because it's been a long day,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.136
you're going to be
transported to the parking lot.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.776
(Laughter)

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.616
And you know, sleeping is very important.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.416
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.136
So in the parking lot you stay
for a certain amount of time,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.416
and then after this
you just, you know, go back,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.776
you see more of the things you like to see

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.840
or go home with your certificate.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.696
So this institute right now is virtual.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.576
Right now, I am just
making my institute in Brazil,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.267
then it's going to be in Australia,

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.416
then it's coming here,
to Canada and everywhere.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.936
And this is to experience
a kind of simple method,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.856
how you go back to simplicity
in your own life.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.840
Counting rice will be another thing.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.656
(Laughter)

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.176
You know, if you count rice
you can make life, too.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.376
How to count rice for six hours?

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.096
It's incredibly important.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.256
You know, you go through this whole range
of being bored, being angry,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.736
being completely frustrated, not finishing
the amount of rice you're counting.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.536
And then this unbelievable
amount of peace you get

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.016
when satisfying work is finished --

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.840
or counting sand in the desert.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.096
Or having the sound-isolated situation --

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.696
that you have headphones,
that you don't hear anything,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.416
and you're just there
together without sound,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.296
with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.536
We are always doing things
we like in our life.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.816
And this is why you're not changing.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.296
You do things in life --

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.720
it's just nothing happens
if you always do things the same way.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.296
But my method is to do things
I'm afraid of, the things I fear,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.816
the things I don't know,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.696
to go to territory
that nobody's ever been.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.576
And then also to include the failure.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.336
I think failure is important

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.096
because if you go,
if you experiment, you can fail.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.776
If you don't go into that area
and you don't fail,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800
you are actually repeating yourself
over and over again.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.136
And I think that human beings
right now need a change,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.256
and the only change to be made
is a personal level change.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.856
You have to make the change on yourself.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.376
Because the only way
to change consciousness

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.416
and to change the world around us,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.136
is to start with yourself.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.656
It's so easy to criticize
how it's different,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.823
the things in the world
and they're not right,

00:14:11.847 --> 00:14:15.096
and the governments are corrupted
and there's hunger in the world

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.576
and there's wars -- the killing.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.176
But what we do on the personal level --

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.160
what is our contribution
to this whole thing?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.056
Can you turn to your neighbor,
the one you don't know,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.200
and look at them for two full minutes
in their eyes, right now?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.336
(Chatter)

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.256
I'm asking two minutes
of your time, that's so little.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.616
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,
don't be self-conscious.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.256
Be relaxed.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.680
And just look a complete
stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.280
(Silence)

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.680
Thank you for trusting me.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:44.560
(Applause)

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.960
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.040
Thank you so much.
