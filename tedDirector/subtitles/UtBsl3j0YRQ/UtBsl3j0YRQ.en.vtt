00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:16.231
There is something you know about me,

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:20.071
something very personal,

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.526
and there is something
I know about every one of you

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.498
and that's very central to your concerns.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:31.244
There is something that we know

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:37.302
about everyone we meet
anywhere in the world, on the street,

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:42.280
that is the very mainspring
of whatever they do

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:44.519
and whatever they put up with.

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:51.302
And that is that all of us
want to be happy.

00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.679
In this, we are all together.

00:00:55.203 --> 00:01:00.677
How we imagine our happiness,
that differs from one another,

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:05.505
but it's already a lot
that we have all in common,

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.743
that we want to be happy.

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:12.116
Now my topic is gratefulness.

00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:18.002
What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.304
Many people would say,
well, that's very easy.

00:01:22.328 --> 00:01:24.846
When you are happy, you are grateful.

00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:27.841
But think again.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:33.908
Is it really the happy people
that are grateful?

00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:38.618
We all know quite a number of people

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:42.819
who have everything
that it would take to be happy,

00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:44.600
and they are not happy,

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:48.339
because they want something else
or they want more of the same.

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:56.997
And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune,

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.798
misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have,

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:03.020
and they are deeply happy.

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:06.993
They radiate happiness. You are surprised.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:09.216
Why? Because they are grateful.

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:14.383
So it is not happiness
that makes us grateful.

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:16.922
It's gratefulness that makes us happy.

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:20.752
If you think it's happiness
that makes you grateful,

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.261
think again.

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.539
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.

00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:28.781
Now, we can ask,

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.266
what do we really mean by gratefulness?

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:34.815
And how does it work?

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:39.951
I appeal to your own experience.

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:42.708
We all know from experience how it goes.

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:48.053
We experience something
that's valuable to us.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:53.033
Something is given to us
that's valuable to us.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:55.847
And it's really given.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.090
These two things have to come together.

00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:03.703
It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift.

00:03:03.727 --> 00:03:06.870
You haven't bought it.
You haven't earned it.

00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:09.345
You haven't traded it in.
You haven't worked for it.

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:10.797
It's just given to you.

00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:13.064
And when these two things come together,

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:18.713
something that's really valuable to me
and I realize it's freely given,

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:23.650
then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart,

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:27.318
happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.

00:03:28.037 --> 00:03:30.202
That's how gratefulness happens.

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:36.941
Now the key to all this

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:43.682
is that we cannot only
experience this once in a while.

00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:48.731
We cannot only have grateful experiences.

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:51.990
We can be people who live gratefully.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.260
Grateful living, that is the thing.

00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:58.589
And how can we live gratefully?

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:04.496
By experiencing, by becoming aware

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.269
that every moment
is a given moment, as we say.

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:11.874
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:14.486
You haven't brought it about in any way.

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.893
You have no way of assuring

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:20.893
that there will be
another moment given to you,

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:25.982
and yet, that's the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us,

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:31.494
this moment, with all the opportunity
that it contains.

00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:34.158
If we didn't have this present moment,

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.358
we wouldn't have
any opportunity to do anything

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:39.206
or experience anything,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.218
and this moment is a gift.

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:43.154
It's a given moment, as we say.

00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:50.328
Now, we say the gift within this gift
is really the opportunity.

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:54.894
What you are really grateful for
is the opportunity,

00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:56.852
not the thing that is given to you,

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:58.831
because if that thing were somewhere else

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:02.361
and you didn't have
the opportunity to enjoy it,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.196
to do something with it,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.163
you wouldn't be grateful for it.

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:11.145
Opportunity is the gift within every gift,

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.842
and we have this saying,
opportunity knocks only once.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.522
Well, think again.

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:24.866
Every moment is a new gift,
over and over again,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.134
and if you miss the opportunity
of this moment,

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:31.740
another moment is given to us,
and another moment.

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.865
We can avail ourselves
of this opportunity,

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.736
or we can miss it,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.670
and if we avail ourselves
of the opportunity,

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.487
it is the key to happiness.

00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.752
Behold the master key to our happiness

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.555
in our own hands.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:53.276
Moment by moment,
we can be grateful for this gift.

00:05:53.593 --> 00:05:56.092
Does that mean

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:58.827
that we can be grateful for everything?

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.216
Certainly not.

00:06:01.597 --> 00:06:06.513
We cannot be grateful
for violence, for war,

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.004
for oppression, for exploitation.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.099
On the personal level,
we cannot be grateful

00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:15.400
for the loss of a friend,
for unfaithfulness,

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:17.146
for bereavement.

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:22.503
But I didn't say
we can be grateful for everything.

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:27.009
I said we can be grateful
in every given moment

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:28.863
for the opportunity,

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:35.282
and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult,

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:37.822
we can rise to this occasion

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:42.077
and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.452
It isn't as bad as it might seem.

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:48.345
Actually, when you look at it
and experience it,

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:51.301
you find that most of the time,

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:55.034
what is given to us
is the opportunity to enjoy,

00:06:55.058 --> 00:06:58.075
and we only miss it
because we are rushing through life

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.502
and we are not stopping
to see the opportunity.

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.326
But once in a while,

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.272
something very difficult is given to us,

00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:10.363
and when this difficult thing
occurs to us,

00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:14.691
it's a challenge to rise
to that opportunity,

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:18.111
and we can rise to it
by learning something

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:19.852
which is sometimes painful.

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:21.939
Learning patience, for instance.

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.936
We have been told that the road to peace

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.704
is not a sprint,
but is more like a marathon.

00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:31.265
That takes patience. That's difficult.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:38.530
It may be to stand up for your opinion,
to stand up for your conviction.

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.863
That's an opportunity that is given to us.

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:45.739
To learn, to suffer, to stand up,

00:07:45.763 --> 00:07:48.109
all these opportunities are given to us,

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:49.615
but they are opportunities,

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:53.491
and those who avail themselves
of those opportunities

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.618
are the ones that we admire.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.890
They make something out of life.

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:02.642
And those who fail
get another opportunity.

00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:05.216
We always get another opportunity.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.297
That's the wonderful richness of life.

00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:16.797
So how can we find a method
that will harness this?

00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:21.827
How can each one of us find a method
for living gratefully,

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.756
not just once in a while being grateful,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.188
but moment by moment to be grateful.

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.943
How can we do it?
It's a very simple method.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:35.030
It's so simple that it's actually
what we were told as children

00:08:35.054 --> 00:08:37.359
when we learned to cross the street.

00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:39.121
Stop.

00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:40.622
Look.

00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:41.847
Go.

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:43.246
That's all.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.643
But how often do we stop?

00:08:45.982 --> 00:08:48.727
We rush through life. We don't stop.

00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:52.149
We miss the opportunity
because we don't stop.

00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:55.340
We have to stop.

00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:57.716
We have to get quiet.

00:08:58.128 --> 00:09:02.930
And we have to build
stop signs into our lives.

00:09:03.628 --> 00:09:08.596
When I was in Africa
some years ago and then came back,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.724
I noticed water.

00:09:11.114 --> 00:09:15.269
In Africa where I was,
I didn't have drinkable water.

00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:19.249
Every time I turned on the faucet,
I was overwhelmed.

00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:23.652
Every time I clicked on the light,
I was so grateful.

00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:25.217
It made me so happy.

00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:27.224
But after a while, this wears off.

00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:31.010
So I put little stickers
on the light switch

00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:32.711
and on the water faucet,

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:35.191
and every time I turned it on, water.

00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:38.673
So leave it up to your own imagination.

00:09:38.697 --> 00:09:40.650
You can find whatever works best for you,

00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:43.936
but you need stop signs in your life.

00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:46.205
And when you stop,

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:48.309
then the next thing is to look.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.961
You look. You open your eyes.

00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:53.247
You open your ears. You open your nose.

00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.667
You open all your senses

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:58.922
for this wonderful richness
that is given to us.

00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:03.278
There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about,

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:06.908
to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.

00:10:06.932 --> 00:10:09.751
And then we can also open our hearts,

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:12.597
our hearts for the opportunities,

00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:15.839
for the opportunities also to help others,

00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:17.134
to make others happy,

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:21.266
because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy.

00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:26.877
And when we open
our hearts to the opportunities,

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.517
the opportunities invite us
to do something,

00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:31.864
and that is the third.

00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:35.978
Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something.

00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:37.931
And what we can do

00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:42.617
is whatever life offers to you
in that present moment.

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:47.684
Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:51.084
but sometimes
it's something more difficult.

00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:55.376
But whatever it is,
if we take this opportunity,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.847
we go with it, we are creative,
those are the creative people.

00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:04.720
And that little stop, look, go,

00:11:04.744 --> 00:11:06.974
is such a potent seed

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:10.069
that it can revolutionize our world.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.796
Because we are at the present moment

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.132
in the middle of a change
of consciousness,

00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:21.697
and you will be surprised if you --

00:11:22.002 --> 00:11:24.664
I am always surprised
when I hear how many times

00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:27.592
this word "gratefulness"
and "gratitude" comes up.

00:11:27.952 --> 00:11:29.266
Everywhere you find it,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.545
a grateful airline,
a restaurant gratefulness,

00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:35.754
a café gratefulness,
a wine that is gratefulness.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:39.029
Yes, I have even come across
a toilet paper

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:41.396
whose brand is called "Thank You."

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.016
(Laughter)

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.982
There is a wave of gratefulness

00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:48.788
because people are becoming aware
how important this is

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:51.408
and how this can change our world.

00:11:51.884 --> 00:11:58.500
It can change our world
in immensely important ways,

00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:02.111
because if you're grateful,
you're not fearful,

00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:05.497
and if you're not fearful,
you're not violent.

00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:09.683
If you're grateful,
you act out of a sense of enough

00:12:09.707 --> 00:12:11.777
and not of a sense of scarcity,

00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:13.826
and you are willing to share.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.118
If you are grateful,

00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:17.993
you are enjoying
the differences between people,

00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:20.372
and you are respectful to everybody,

00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:24.105
and that changes this power pyramid
under which we live.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:29.133
And it doesn't make for equality,
but it makes for equal respect,

00:12:29.157 --> 00:12:31.137
and that is the important thing.

00:12:31.161 --> 00:12:34.837
The future of the world will be a network,

00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:38.487
not a pyramid turned upside down.

00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:42.999
The revolution of which I am speaking
is a nonviolent revolution,

00:12:43.023 --> 00:12:46.888
and it's so revolutionary
that it even revolutionizes

00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:49.069
the very concept of a revolution,

00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:51.330
because the normal revolution

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.338
is one where the power pyramid
is turned upside down

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:57.507
and those who were on the bottom
are now on the top

00:12:57.531 --> 00:13:01.657
and are doing exactly the same thing
that the ones before.

00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:06.558
What we need is a networking
of smaller groups,

00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:10.228
smaller and smaller groups
who know one another,

00:13:10.252 --> 00:13:14.799
who interact with one another,
and that is a grateful world.

00:13:14.823 --> 00:13:18.947
A grateful world
is a world of joyful people.

00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:21.618
Grateful people are joyful people,

00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:23.659
and joyful people --

00:13:23.683 --> 00:13:26.422
the more and more joyful people there are,

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:29.720
the more and more
we'll have a joyful world.

00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:36.805
We have a network for grateful living,
and it has mushroomed.

00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:39.252
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:42.588
We have an opportunity
for people to light a candle

00:13:42.612 --> 00:13:44.773
when they are grateful for something.

00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:51.638
And there have been
15 million candles lit in one decade.

00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:58.273
People are becoming aware
that a grateful world is a happy world,

00:13:58.297 --> 00:14:04.299
and we all have the opportunity
by the simple stop, look, go,

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:08.035
to transform the world,
to make it a happy place.

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:09.537
And that is what I hope for us,

00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:14.435
and if this has contributed a little
to making you want to do the same,

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:16.097
stop, look, go.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.290
Thank you.

00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:20.678
(Applause)
