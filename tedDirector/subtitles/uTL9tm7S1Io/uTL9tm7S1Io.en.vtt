00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:18.156
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.434
how they lived,

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.980
how they fought ...

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:22.528
but how did they think?

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:27.872
One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought --

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:29.768
our ability to imagine,

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.189
to be conscious,

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:32.444
to dream --

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:34.087
have always been the same.

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:36.371
Another possibility

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.118
is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:43.927
may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.435
We may all have different
opinions about this.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:50.176
Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate.

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.371
But is this question
even amenable to science?

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.340
Here I'd like to propose

00:00:57.364 --> 00:01:02.136
that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.548
just based on a few bricks,

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:08.698
that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.865
the fossils, of human thought.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.079
And in fact,

00:01:13.103 --> 00:01:15.309
doing some form of psychological analysis

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.877
of some of the most ancient
books of human culture,

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:24.856
Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis:

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.293
that only 3,000 years ago,

00:01:27.317 --> 00:01:32.205
humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics.

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:35.261
And he made this claim

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:38.586
based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.514
behaved consistently,

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:43.554
in different traditions
and in different places of the world,

00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:47.110
as if they were hearing and obeying voices

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.174
that they perceived
as coming from the Gods,

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:51.396
or from the muses ...

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:54.832
what today we would call hallucinations.

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:58.514
And only then, as time went on,

00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:02.189
they began to recognize
that they were the creators,

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:04.728
the owners of these inner voices.

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:08.031
And with this, they gained introspection:

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:10.538
the ability to think
about their own thoughts.

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:15.182
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:18.372
at least in the way we perceive it today,

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:21.936
where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence --

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.697
is a quite recent cultural development.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.242
And this theory is quite spectacular,

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.699
but it has an obvious problem

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:32.715
which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.848
So the question is whether the theory

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:39.623
that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:42.631
can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner.

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:47.106
And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.590
It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote,

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:52.273
"Hello, I'm Plato,

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.186
and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness."

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.503
(Laughter)

00:02:57.527 --> 00:03:00.860
And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:05.522
We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:10.744
The word introspection
does not appear a single time

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:12.687
in the books we want to analyze.

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:17.815
So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words.

00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:21.858
This is a huge space
that contains all words

00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:24.684
in such a way that the distance
between any two of them

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:27.591
is indicative of how
closely related they are.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.611
So for instance,

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:32.532
you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together,

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:36.387
but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.705
And this has to be true
for any two words within the space.

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:44.967
And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.634
One is just asking the experts,

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:48.554
a bit like we do with dictionaries.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.324
Another possibility

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:54.063
is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related,

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.436
they tend to appear in the same sentences,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.913
in the same paragraphs,

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.707
in the same documents,

00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:02.913
more often than would be expected
just by pure chance.

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:06.281
And this simple hypothesis,

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:07.611
this simple method,

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.242
with some computational tricks

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.655
that have to do with the fact

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.743
that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space,

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:15.432
turns out to be quite effective.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.957
And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works,

00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:22.893
this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words.

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:24.792
And you can see first

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:28.094
that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods.

00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:30.335
So you get the fruits, the body parts,

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:32.784
the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on.

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:37.341
The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.

00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:39.003
So for instance,

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:42.624
you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.748
of the astronomic and the physics terms.

00:04:45.338 --> 00:04:47.584
And then there are very fine things.

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:49.513
For instance, the word astronomy,

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:51.352
which seems a bit bizarre where it is,

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.424
is actually exactly where it should be,

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:55.043
between what it is,

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:56.337
an actual science,

00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:57.897
and between what it describes,

00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:59.413
the astronomical terms.

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.073
And we could go on and on with this.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:04.157
Actually, if you stare
at this for a while,

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:06.039
and you just build random trajectories,

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:09.229
you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.900
And this is because, in a way,

00:05:11.924 --> 00:05:14.864
walking in this space
is like walking in the mind.

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:17.644
And the last thing

00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:21.708
is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions,

00:05:21.732 --> 00:05:25.628
of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection.

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:26.875
So for instance,

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:30.878
words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion,"

00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:32.791
are very close to "introspection,"

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:33.966
but other words,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.157
such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana,"

00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:37.633
are just very far away.

00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:40.816
And so once we've built the space,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.666
the question of the history
of introspection,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.023
or of the history of any concept

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:50.826
which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.454
becomes concrete --

00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:55.216
becomes amenable to quantitative science.

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:58.978
All that we have to do is take the books,

00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:00.383
we digitize them,

00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:03.216
and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.209
and project them into the space,

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:08.987
and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time

00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:12.003
circling closely to the concept
of introspection.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.956
And with this,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.092
we could analyze
the history of introspection

00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:18.037
in the ancient Greek tradition,

00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:20.663
for which we have the best
available written record.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.886
So what we did is we took all the books --

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.194
we just ordered them by time --

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:27.970
for each book we take the words

00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:29.955
and we project them to the space,

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.011
and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection,

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:34.265
and we just average that.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.788
And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on,

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:41.064
these books get closer,
and closer and closer

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:42.842
to the concept of introspection.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:46.667
And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:50.825
So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition,

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.261
there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:56.491
But about four centuries before Christ,

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:01.223
this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase

00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:03.747
of books getting closer,
and closer and closer

00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:05.453
to the concept of introspection.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.583
And one of the nice things about this

00:07:08.607 --> 00:07:09.805
is that now we can ask

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:13.976
whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition.

00:07:14.962 --> 00:07:18.138
So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:20.883
and we got virtually the same pattern.

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:26.183
Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament,

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.121
and then it increases much more rapidly

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:29.984
in the new books of the New Testament.

00:07:30.008 --> 00:07:32.040
And then we get the peak of introspection

00:07:32.064 --> 00:07:34.191
in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"

00:07:34.215 --> 00:07:36.072
about four centuries after Christ.

00:07:36.897 --> 00:07:38.841
And this was very important,

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:42.238
because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars,

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.434
philologists, historians,

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:46.536
as one of the founders of introspection.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.357
Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.851
So our algorithm,

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.717
which has the virtue
of being quantitative,

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.004
of being objective,

00:07:57.028 --> 00:07:59.044
and of course of being extremely fast --

00:07:59.068 --> 00:08:01.465
it just runs in a fraction of a second --

00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:04.992
can capture some of the most
important conclusions

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:07.238
of this long tradition of investigation.

00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:11.968
And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science,

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:15.468
which is that now this idea
can be translated

00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:18.063
and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains.

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:23.536
So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.966
maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.127
is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.020
To put it more precisely,

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:35.460
whether the words we say today

00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:40.681
can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days,

00:08:40.705 --> 00:08:41.856
in a few months

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.062
or a few years from now.

00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:46.617
And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.427
that detect our heart rate,

00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:49.720
our respiration,

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.411
our genes,

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:55.086
on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.631
we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak,

00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:01.338
we tweet, we email, we write,

00:09:01.362 --> 00:09:06.170
can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds.

00:09:07.087 --> 00:09:08.621
And with Guillermo Cecchi,

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:11.646
who has been my brother in this adventure,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.225
we took on this task.

00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:19.760
And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people

00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:22.585
who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia.

00:09:23.434 --> 00:09:26.315
And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one,

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:29.581
and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict,

00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:32.101
within a window of almost three years,

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.160
the future development of psychosis.

00:09:35.427 --> 00:09:37.793
But despite our hopes,

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:40.934
we got failure after failure.

00:09:41.793 --> 00:09:45.675
There was just not enough
information in semantics

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:48.492
to predict the future
organization of the mind.

00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:50.325
It was good enough

00:09:50.349 --> 00:09:54.524
to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group,

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:57.260
a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts,

00:09:57.284 --> 00:10:00.278
but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis.

00:10:01.164 --> 00:10:02.870
But then we realized

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.982
that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying,

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.679
but how they were saying it.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.899
More specifically,

00:10:10.923 --> 00:10:13.750
it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were,

00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:16.374
but how far and fast they jumped

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.699
from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one.

00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:20.978
And so we came up with this measure,

00:10:21.002 --> 00:10:23.391
which we termed semantic coherence,

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:28.219
which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic,

00:10:28.243 --> 00:10:29.772
within one semantic category.

00:10:31.294 --> 00:10:35.341
And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people,

00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:39.024
the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict,

00:10:39.048 --> 00:10:41.548
with 100 percent accuracy,

00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:44.079
who developed psychosis and who will not.

00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:47.913
And this was something
that could not be achieved --

00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:49.445
not even close --

00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:52.595
with all the other
existing clinical measures.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:58.104
And I remember vividly,
while I was working on this,

00:10:58.128 --> 00:11:00.445
I was sitting at my computer

00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:03.104
and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:06.295
Polo had been my first student
back in Buenos Aires,

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:08.389
and at the time
he was living in New York.

00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:10.501
And there was something in this tweets --

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:14.026
I could not tell exactly what
because nothing was said explicitly --

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.071
but I got this strong hunch,

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:19.050
this strong intuition,
that something was going wrong.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.070
So I picked up the phone,
and I called Polo,

00:11:23.094 --> 00:11:25.013
and in fact he was not feeling well.

00:11:25.362 --> 00:11:27.299
And this simple fact,

00:11:27.323 --> 00:11:29.814
that reading in between the lines,

00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:34.100
I could sense,
through words, his feelings,

00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:36.743
was a simple, but very
effective way to help.

00:11:37.987 --> 00:11:39.625
What I tell you today

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:42.157
is that we're getting
close to understanding

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:46.467
how we can convert this intuition
that we all have,

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:47.856
that we all share,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.077
into an algorithm.

00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:51.563
And in doing so,

00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:56.237
we may be seeing in the future
a very different form of mental health,

00:11:56.261 --> 00:12:01.882
based on objective, quantitative
and automated analysis

00:12:01.906 --> 00:12:03.615
of the words we write,

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.176
of the words we say.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.351
Gracias.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:13.258
