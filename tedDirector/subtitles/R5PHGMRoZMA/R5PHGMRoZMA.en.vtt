00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.533
You may not realize this,

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:19.413
but there are more bacteria in your body
than stars in our entire galaxy.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.167
This fascinating universe
of bacteria inside of us

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.443
is an integral part of our health,

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.532
and our technology is evolving so rapidly

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:32.291
that today we can program these bacteria
like we program computers.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.939
Now, the diagram that you see here,

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.470
I know it looks like
some kind of sports play,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.626
but it is actually a blueprint of
the first bacterial program I developed.

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:44.947
And like writing software,
we can print and write DNA

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:48.174
into different algorithms
and programs inside of bacteria.

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:51.519
What this program does
is produces fluorescent proteins

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.957
in a rhythmic fashion

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:54.559
and generates a small molecule

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.137
that allows bacteria
to communicate and synchronize,

00:00:57.137 --> 00:00:58.975
as you're seeing in this movie.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.785
The growing colony of bacteria
that you see here

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.778
is about the width of a human hair.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:06.285
Now, what you can't see
is that our genetic program

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:09.768
instructs these bacteria
to each produce small molecules,

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.181
and these molecules travel between
the thousands of individual bacteria

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.897
telling them when to turn on and off.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:19.148
And the bacteria synchronize
quite well at this scale,

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:23.142
but because the molecule that synchronizes
them together can only travel so fast,

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:26.718
in larger colonies of bacteria,
this results in traveling waves

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:29.620
between bacteria that are
far away from each other,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.356
and you can see these waves going
from right to left across the screen.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:36.144
Now, our genetic program
relies on a natural phenomenon

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:37.317
called quorum sensing,

00:01:37.317 --> 00:01:40.649
in which bacteria trigger coordinated
and sometimes virulent behaviors

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.590
once they reach a critical density.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.245
You can observe quorum sensing
in action in this movie,

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:49.887
where a growing colony of bacteria
only begins to glow

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:52.258
once it reaches a high
or critical density.

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.100
Our genetic program

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.251
continues producing these
rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.619
as the colony grows outwards.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.310
This particular movie and experiment
we call The Supernova,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340
because it looks like an exploding star.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.730
Now, besides programming
these beautiful patterns,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.321
I wondered, what else can we get
these bacteria to do?

00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:13.900
And I decided to explore
how we can program bacteria

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.689
to detect and treat diseases
in our bodies like cancer.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.307
One of the surprising facts about bacteria

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:23.744
is that they can naturally grow
inside of tumors.

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.508
This happens because typically tumors

00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:27.923
are areas where the immune system
has no access,

00:02:27.923 --> 00:02:29.920
and so bacteria find these tumors

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.751
and use them as a safe haven
to grow and thrive.

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.585
We started using probiotic bacteria

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:38.209
which are safe bacteria
that have a health benefit,

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.670
and found that
when orally delivered to mice,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.826
these probiotics would selectively
grow inside of liver tumors.

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.780
We realized that the most convenient way

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.861
to highlight the presence
of the probiotics,

00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:50.724
and hence, the presence of the tumors,

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:52.953
was to get these bacteria
to produce a signal

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:55.069
that would be detectable in the urine,

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.481
and so we specifically
programmed these probiotics

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.360
to make a molecule that would change
the color of your urine

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.170
to indicate the presence of cancer.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.180
We went on to show that this technology

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.370
could sensitively and specifically
detect liver cancer,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.060
one that is challenging
to detect otherwise.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.890
Now, since these bacteria
specifically localize to tumors,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.478
we've been programming them
to not only detect cancer

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:19.266
but also to treat cancer

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.493
by producing therapeutic molecules
from within the tumor environment

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.815
that shrink the existing tumors,

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:27.570
and we've been doing this
using quorum sensing programs

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.413
like you saw in the previous movies.

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:33.110
Altogether, imagine in the future
taking a programmed probiotic

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.589
that could detect and treat cancer,

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.170
or even other diseases.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.604
Our ability to program bacteria

00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:42.299
and program life

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.248
opens up new horizons in cancer research,

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:47.983
and to share this vision,
I worked with artist Vik Muniz

00:03:47.983 --> 00:03:49.799
to create the symbol of the universe,

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.440
made entirely out of bacteria
or cancer cells.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:58.645
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty
and purpose of this microscopic universe

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:03.544
can inspire new and creative approaches
for the future of cancer research.

00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:06.168
Thank you.

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:09.934
(Applause)
