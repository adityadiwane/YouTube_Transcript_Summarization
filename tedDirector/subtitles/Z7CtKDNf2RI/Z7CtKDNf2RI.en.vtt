00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.796
I'm Ellen and I'm totally
obsessed with food.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.820
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:23.296
I started out obsessed
with global security policy,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.776
because I lived in New York during 9/11
and it was a very relevant thing.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.753
I got from global security policy to food

00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.496
because I realized when I'm hungry,
I'm really pissed off,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.696
and I'm assuming
the rest of the world is too.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.416
Especially if you and your kids are hungry
and your neighbor's kids are hungry

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.296
and your whole neighborhood is hungry.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.476
And actually, it looks like
the areas of the world that are hungry

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.196
are also the areas of the world
that are pretty insecure.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.956
So I took a job at the United Nations
World Food Programme

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.236
as a way to try to address
these security issues

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.676
through food security issues.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.193
There, I came across what I think
is the most brilliant of their programs.

00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:57.842
It's called School Feeding
and it's a really simple idea

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.446
to get in the middle
of the cycle of poverty and hunger

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.563
that continues for a lot of people
around the world, and stop it.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.556
A free school meal gets kids into school,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.956
which is education,
the first step out of poverty,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.476
but it also gives them the micronutrients
and the macronutrients they need

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.196
to develop mentally and physically.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.636
While I was working at the UN,
I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.327
And she had this really awesome idea
to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" --

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.796
which is really beautifully ironic
because you can strap on the Feed Bag.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.556
But each bag we'd sell would provide

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.116
a year's worth
of school meals for one kid.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.036
It's so simple, and we thought, OK,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.436
it costs between 20 and 50 bucks
to provide school feeding for a year.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.516
We could sell these bags
and raise a ton of money and awareness

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.956
for the World Food Programme.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.036
But at the UN,
sometimes things move slowly

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.396
and they basically said no.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.036
And we thought, this is such a good idea,
it's going to raise so much money.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.396
So we said screw it,
we'll start our own company,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.849
which we did, three years ago.

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:51.676
That was my first dream,
to start this company called FEED,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.596
and here's a screenshot of our website.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.276
We did a bag for Haiti
just a month after the earthquake

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.356
to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.596
So FEED's doing great.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.596
We've so far provided 55 million meals
to kids around the world

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.036
by selling now 550,000 bags,
a ton of bags, a lot of bags.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.796
All this time you're really --

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.676
hunger is a hard thing to think about,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.556
because what we think about is eating.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.836
I think about eating a lot
and I really love it.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.476
And the thing that's strange
about international hunger

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.356
and talking about international issues

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.996
is that most people want to know:

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.476
"What are you doing for America's kids?"

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.516
There's definitely hunger in America:

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.076
49 million people
and almost 16.7 million children.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.476
I mean that's pretty dramatic
for our own country.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.036
Hunger definitely means
something different in America

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.476
than it does internationally,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.676
but it's incredibly important
to address hunger in our own country.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.396
But the bigger problem
that we all know about is obesity,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.676
and it's dramatic.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.196
The other thing that's dramatic

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.676
is that both hunger and obesity
have really risen in the last 30 years.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.276
Unfortunately, obesity's
not only an American problem.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.636
It's actually been spreading
all around the world

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.716
and mainly through our kind
of food systems that we're exporting.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.156
The numbers are pretty crazy.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.276
There's a billion people
obese or overweight

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.676
and a billion people hungry.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.956
So those seem like
two bifurcated problems,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.196
but I kind of started
to think about, you know,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.556
what is obesity and hunger?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.196
What are both those things about?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.676
Well, they're both about food.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.676
And when you think about food,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.516
the underpinning of food in both cases
is potentially problematic agriculture.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.436
And agriculture is where food comes from.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.476
Agriculture in America's very interesting.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.236
It's very consolidated

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.196
and the foods that are produced
lead to the foods that we eat.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.396
The foods that are produced are,
more or less, corn, soy and wheat.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.076
And that's three-quarters
of the food that we're eating:

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.636
processed foods and fast foods.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.676
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.156
we haven't done a good job
in the last three decades

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.516
of exporting those technologies
around the world.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.876
So African agriculture, which is the place
of most hunger in the world,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.596
has actually fallen precipitously
as hunger has risen.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.716
So somehow we're not making the connect

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.076
between exporting
a good agricultural system

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.356
that will help feed people
all around the world.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.676
Who is farming?
That's what I was wondering.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.316
So I went and stood
on a big grain bin in the Midwest,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.716
and that really didn't help me
understand farming,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.636
but I think it's a really cool picture.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.596
And the reality is
that between farmers in America --

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.556
who actually, quite frankly,
when I spend time in the Midwest,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.316
are pretty large in general.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.156
And their farms are also large.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.156
But farmers in the rest of the world
are actually quite skinny,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.895
and that's because they're starving.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.556
Most hungry people in the world
are subsistence farmers.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.396
And most of those people are women --

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.316
which is a totally other topic
that I won't get on right now,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.796
but I'd love to do
the feminist thing at some point.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.396
I think it's really interesting to look
at agriculture from these two sides.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.116
There's this large, consolidated farming
that's led to what we eat in America,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.116
and it's really been since around 1980,
after the oil crisis,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.956
when, you know -- mass consolidation,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.196
mass exodus of small farmers
in this country.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.836
And then in the same time period,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.836
we've kind of left Africa's farmers
to do their own thing.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.716
Unfortunately, what is farmed
ends up as what we eat.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.756
And in America, a lot of what we eat
has led to obesity

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.756
and has led to a real change

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.420
in sort of what our diet is,
in the last 30 years.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.116
It's crazy.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.996
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.996
Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.996
But people do, because it's so cheap,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.276
and so our whole food system
in the last 30 years has really shifted.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.996
I mean, you know,
it's not just in our own country,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.956
but really we're exporting
the system around the world,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.876
and when you look at the data
of least developed countries --

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.316
especially in cities,
which are growing really rapidly --

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.636
people are eating
American processed foods.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.996
And in one generation,
they're going from hunger

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.996
and all of the detrimental
health effects of hunger

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.636
to obesity and things like diabetes
and heart disease in one generation.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.316
So the problematic food system
is affecting both hunger and obesity.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.516
Not to beat a dead horse,
but this is a global food system

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.636
where there's a billion people hungry
and a billion people obese.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.716
I think that's the only way to look at it.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.596
And instead of taking these two things

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.796
as bifurcated problems
that are very separate,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.716
it's really important
to look at them as one system.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.116
We get a lot of our food
from all around the world

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.316
and people from all around the world
are importing our food system,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.356
so it's incredibly relevant
to start a new way of looking at it.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.636
I've learned --
and the technology people here,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.156
which I'm totally not one of --

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.116
but apparently, it really takes 30 years

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.956
for a lot of technologies
to become really endemic to us,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.476
like the mouse
and the Internet and Windows.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.116
You know, there's 30-year cycles.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.276
I think 2010 can be
a really interesting year

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.316
because it is the end
of the 30-year cycle,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.596
and it's the birthday
of the global food system.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.836
That's the first birthday
I want to talk about.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.596
If we really think that this is something
that's happened in the last 30 years,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.876
there's hope in that.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.756
It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.716
and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets,
high-fructose corn syrup,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.996
the farm crisis in America

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.156
and the change in how we've addressed
agriculture internationally.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.036
So there's a lot of reasons
to take this 30-year time period

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.516
as sort of the creation
of this new food system.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.676
I'm not the only one who's obsessed
with this whole 30-year thing.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.396
The icons like Michael Pollan
and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.356
both addressed this last
three-decade time period

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.396
as incredibly relevant
for food system change.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.996
Well, I really care about 1980

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.156
because it's also the 30th
anniversary of me this year.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.836
And so in my lifetime,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.796
a lot of what's happened in the world --

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.756
and being a person obsessed with food --

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.636
a lot of this has really changed.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.756
So my second dream is that I think
we can look to the next 30 years

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.196
as a time to change the food system again.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.156
And we know what's happened in the past,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.356
so if we start now
and we look at technologies

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.556
and improvements
to the food system long-term,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.676
we might be able
to recreate the food system

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.036
so when I give my next talk
and I'm 60 years old,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.196
I'll be able to say
that it's been a success.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.876
So I'm announcing today
the start of a new organization,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.916
or a new fund within the FEED Foundation,
called the 30 Project.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.676
And the 30 Project is really focused

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.516
on these long-term ideas
for food system change.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.036
And I think by aligning international
advocates that are addressing hunger

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.476
and domestic advocates
that are addressing obesity,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.836
we might actually look
for long-term solutions

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.276
that will make the food system
better for everyone.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.076
We all tend to think
that these systems are quite different

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.876
and people argue whether or not
organic can feed the world,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.316
but if we take a 30-year view,
there's more hope in collaborative ideas.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.316
So I'm hoping that by connecting
really disparate organizations

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.076
like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.476
which don't seem right now
to have much in common,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.356
we can talk about holistic,
long-term, systemic solutions

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.316
that will improve food for everyone.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.769
Some ideas I've had is like,
look, the reality is --

00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:12.236
kids in the South Bronx
need apples and carrots

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.916
and so do kids in Botswana.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.876
And how are we going
to get those kids those nutritious foods?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.556
Another thing that's become incredibly
global is production of meat and fish.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.316
Understanding how to produce protein

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.356
in a way that's healthy
for the environment

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.636
and healthy for people

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.796
will be incredibly important
to address things like climate change

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.876
and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.196
And, you know, these are
really relevant topics

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.036
that are long-term and important

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.116
for both people in Africa
who are small farmers

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.676
and people in America
who are farmers and eaters.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.196
And I also think that thinking
about processed foods in a new way,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.876
where we actually
price the negative externalities

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.596
like petrochemicals
and like fertilizer runoff

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.436
into the price of a bag of chips --

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.116
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes
inherently more expensive than an apple,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.316
then maybe it's time for a different sense
of personal responsibility in food choice

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.276
because the choices are actually choices

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.236
instead of three-quarters of the products
being made just from corn, soy and wheat.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.676
The 30Project.org is launched

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.636
and I've gathered a coalition
of a few organizations to start.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.836
And it'll be growing
over the next few months.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.196
But I really hope
that you will all think of ways

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.956
that you can look long-term
at things like the food system

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.196
and make change.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.513
