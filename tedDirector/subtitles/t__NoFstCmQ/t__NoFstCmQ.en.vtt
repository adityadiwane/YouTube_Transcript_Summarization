00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:18.905
Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize
[winner] in economics, once wrote:

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:24.325
"Productivity is not everything,
but in the long run,

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.523
it is almost everything."

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:29.468
So this is serious.

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:35.018
There are not that many things on earth
that are "almost everything."

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:42.911
Productivity is the principal driver
of the prosperity of a society.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.115
So we have a problem.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.606
In the largest European economies,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.780
productivity used to grow
five percent per annum

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:54.919
in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:58.971
From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.284
From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:07.018
Since 1995: less than
one percent per annum.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.486
The same profile in Japan.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.985
The same profile in the US,

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.342
despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.730
and despite all
the technological innovations

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.333
around us: the Internet, the information,

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:27.578
the new information
and communication technologies.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:32.734
When productivity grows
three percent per annum,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:36.400
you double the standard of living
every generation.

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:42.178
Every generation is twice
as well-off as its parents'.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.012
When it grows one percent per annum,

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.663
it takes three generations
to double the standard of living.

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:55.481
And in this process, many people
will be less well-off than their parents.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.019
They will have less of everything:

00:01:58.043 --> 00:02:01.534
smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:09.044
less access to education, to vitamins,
to antibiotics, to vaccination --

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:10.343
to everything.

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:17.363
Think of all the problems
that we're facing at the moment.

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.509
All.

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:25.131
Chances are that they are rooted
in the productivity crisis.

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:28.907
Why this crisis?

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:35.913
Because the basic tenets
about efficiency --

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:40.748
effectiveness in organizations,
in management --

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:45.023
have become counterproductive
for human efforts.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.705
Everywhere in public services --
in companies, in the way we work,

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:54.065
the way we innovate, invest --
try to learn to work better.

00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:59.440
Take the holy trinity of efficiency:

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:06.717
clarity, measurement, accountability.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.467
They make human efforts derail.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.722
There are two ways
to look at it, to prove it.

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:18.412
One, the one I prefer,

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:23.981
is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.

00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:27.856
But the full math version
takes a little while,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.675
so there is another one.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.165
It is to look at a relay race.

00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:34.365
This is what we will do today.

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:40.739
It's a bit more animated, more visual
and also faster -- it's a race.

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:42.866
Hopefully, it's faster.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.254
(Laughter)

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:49.236
World championship final -- women.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.371
Eight teams in the final.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:54.200
The fastest team is the US team.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.796
They have the fastest women on earth.

00:03:58.153 --> 00:04:00.928
They are the favorite team to win.

00:04:00.952 --> 00:04:05.142
Notably, if you compare them
to an average team,

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.540
say, the French team,

00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:08.151
(Laughter)

00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:13.370
based on their best performances
in the 100-meter race,

00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:19.163
if you add the individual times
of the US runners,

00:04:19.187 --> 00:04:26.099
they arrive at the finish line
3.2 meters ahead of the French team.

00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:29.462
And this year, the US team
is in great shape.

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:32.420
Based on their best performance this year,

00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:37.349
they arrive 6.4 meters
ahead of the French team,

00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:38.738
based on the data.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:40.853
We are going to look at the race.

00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:43.300
At some point you will see,
towards the end,

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:49.630
that Torri Edwards,
the fourth US runner, is ahead.

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:56.143
Not surprising -- this year she got
the gold medal in the 100-meter race.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:05:01.109
And by the way, Chryste Gaines,
the second runner in the US team,

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:03.770
is the fastest woman on earth.

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:08.947
So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.063
Where are the two fastest? On the US team.

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:16.360
And the two other runners
on the US team are not bad, either.

00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:18.100
(Laughter)

00:05:18.124 --> 00:05:22.795
So clearly, the US team has won
the war for talent.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:28.372
But behind, the average team
is trying to catch up.

00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:29.745
Let's watch the race.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.325
(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)

00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:20.886
(Video: Race narration ends)

00:06:22.112 --> 00:06:23.607
Yves Morieux: So what happened?

00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.042
The fastest team did not win;
the slower one did.

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.746
By the way, I hope you appreciate

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.696
the deep historical research I did
to make the French look good.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.015
(Laughter)

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:45.904
But let's not exaggerate --
it's not archeology, either.

00:06:45.928 --> 00:06:47.909
(Laughter)

00:06:47.933 --> 00:06:49.099
But why?

00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:50.663
Because of cooperation.

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:52.521
When you hear this sentence:

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.946
"Thanks to cooperation, the whole
is worth more than the sum of the parts."

00:06:57.707 --> 00:07:01.022
This is not poetry;
this is not philosophy.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.561
This is math.

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:06.476
Those who carry the baton are slower,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.197
but their baton is faster.

00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:10.483
Miracle of cooperation:

00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:16.337
it multiplies energy,
intelligence in human efforts.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:19.336
It is the essence of human efforts:

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.176
how we work together, how each effort
contributes to the efforts of others.

00:07:26.017 --> 00:07:29.265
With cooperation,
we can do more with less.

00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:35.336
Now, what happens to cooperation
when the holy grail --

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.798
the holy trinity, even --

00:07:37.822 --> 00:07:44.043
of clarity, measurement, accountability --

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:45.236
appears?

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.104
Clarity.

00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:52.709
Management reports are full of complaints
about the lack of clarity.

00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:57.141
Compliance audits,
consultants' diagnostics.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.022
We need more clarity, we need
to clarify the roles, the processes.

00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:08.108
It is as though the runners
on the team were saying,

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:14.080
"Let's be clear -- where does my role
really start and end?

00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:19.770
Am I supposed to run for 95 meters,
96, 97...?"

00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:21.584
It's important, let's be clear.

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:25.891
If you say 97, after 97 meters,

00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:29.447
people will drop the baton, whether
there is someone to take it or not.

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:32.367
Accountability.

00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:36.534
We are constantly trying
to put accountability

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.131
in someone's hands.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.132
Who is accountable for this process?

00:08:41.156 --> 00:08:44.277
We need somebody accountable
for this process.

00:08:44.634 --> 00:08:49.095
So in the relay race,
since passing the baton is so important,

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:52.866
then we need somebody
clearly accountable for passing the baton.

00:08:53.786 --> 00:08:55.965
So between each runner,

00:08:55.989 --> 00:09:00.713
now we will have a new dedicated athlete,

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:05.282
clearly dedicated to taking
the baton from one runner,

00:09:05.306 --> 00:09:07.602
and passing it to the next runner.

00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:10.793
And we will have at least two like that.

00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:18.841
Well, will we, in that case, win the race?

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:21.904
That I don't know, but for sure,

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:25.198
we would have a clear interface,

00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:27.866
a clear line of accountability.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.818
We will know who to blame.

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:33.075
But we'll never win the race.

00:09:33.099 --> 00:09:38.086
If you think about it,
we pay more attention

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.265
to knowing who to blame in case we fail,

00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:46.010
than to creating
the conditions to succeed.

00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:50.747
All the human intelligence
put in organization design --

00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:53.556
urban structures, processing systems --

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.204
what is the real goal?

00:09:56.347 --> 00:09:59.277
To have somebody guilty in case they fail.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:05.386
We are creating
organizations able to fail,

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.387
but in a compliant way,

00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:11.853
with somebody clearly
accountable when we fail.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:15.701
And we are quite effective
at that -- failing.

00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:18.053
Measurement.

00:10:18.674 --> 00:10:20.102
What gets measured gets done.

00:10:20.126 --> 00:10:24.517
Look, to pass the baton,
you have to do it at the right time,

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.016
in the right hand, at the right speed.

00:10:27.457 --> 00:10:30.016
But to do that, you have to put
energy in your arm.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.031
This energy that is in your arm
will not be in your legs.

00:10:33.491 --> 00:10:36.470
It will come at the expense
of your measurable speed.

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:40.820
You have to shout early enough
to the next runner

00:10:40.844 --> 00:10:44.155
when you will pass the baton,
to signal that you are arriving,

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:47.384
so that the next runner
can prepare, can anticipate.

00:10:47.408 --> 00:10:49.571
And you have to shout loud.

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:54.155
But the blood, the energy
that will be in your throat

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:55.579
will not be in your legs.

00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:59.359
Because you know, there are
eight people shouting at the same time.

00:10:59.383 --> 00:11:02.022
So you have to recognize the voice
of your colleague.

00:11:02.372 --> 00:11:04.125
You cannot say, "Is it you?"

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.724
Too late!

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:06.954
(Laughter)

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:11.954
Now, let's look at the race
in slow motion,

00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:14.526
and concentrate on the third runner.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.973
Look at where she allocates her efforts,

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:21.704
her energy, her attention.

00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:26.022
Not all in her legs -- that would
be great for her own speed --

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:29.536
but in also in her throat,
arm, eye, brain.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.906
That makes a difference in whose legs?

00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:34.426
In the legs of the next runner.

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:37.562
But when the next runner runs super-fast,

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:39.714
is it because she made a super effort,

00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:42.975
or because of the way
the third runner passed the baton?

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:47.258
There is no metric on earth
that will give us the answer.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.821
And if we reward people on the basis
of their measurable performance,

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.899
they will put their energy,
their attention, their blood

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.946
in what can get measured -- in their legs.

00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:00.827
And the baton will fall and slow down.

00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:04.106
To cooperate is not a super effort,

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.153
it is how you allocate your effort.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.120
It is to take a risk,

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:13.374
because you sacrifice
the ultimate protection

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:18.825
granted by objectively measurable
individual performance.

00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:24.393
It is to make a super difference
in the performance of others,

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:26.107
with whom we are compared.

00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:29.091
It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.

00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:32.281
And people are not stupid;
they don't cooperate.

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:37.878
You know, clarity, accountability,
measurement were OK

00:12:37.902 --> 00:12:40.318
when the world was simpler.

00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:43.953
But business has become much more complex.

00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:46.008
With my teams, we have measured

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:49.056
the evolution of complexity in business.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.683
It is much more demanding today
to attract and retain customers,

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:58.018
to build advantage on a global scale,

00:12:58.042 --> 00:12:59.501
to create value.

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:03.448
And the more business gets complex,

00:13:03.472 --> 00:13:08.773
the more, in the name of clarity,
accountability, measurement

00:13:08.797 --> 00:13:12.461
we multiply structures,
processes, systems.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:17.892
You know, this drive for clarity
and accountability triggers

00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:23.271
a counterproductive multiplication
of interfaces, middle offices,

00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:28.332
coordinators that do not only
mobilize people and resources,

00:13:28.356 --> 00:13:30.665
but that also add obstacles.

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:35.846
And the more complicated the organization,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.523
the more difficult it is to understand
what is really happening.

00:13:39.547 --> 00:13:44.967
So we need summaries, proxies, reports,

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.291
key performance indicators, metrics.

00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:53.027
So people put their energy
in what can get measured,

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:55.146
at the expense of cooperation.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.702
And as performance deteriorates,

00:13:57.726 --> 00:14:00.855
we add even more structure,
process, systems.

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:03.711
People spend their time in meetings,

00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:07.861
writing reports they have
to do, undo and redo.

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:11.711
Based on our analysis,
teams in these organizations

00:14:11.735 --> 00:14:17.906
spend between 40 and 80 percent
of their time wasting their time,

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.923
but working harder and harder,
longer and longer,

00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:24.890
on less and less value-adding activities.

00:14:26.242 --> 00:14:28.552
This is what is killing productivity,

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.774
what makes people suffer at work.

00:14:31.226 --> 00:14:35.763
Our organizations are wasting
human intelligence.

00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:39.435
They have turned against human efforts.

00:14:40.673 --> 00:14:43.563
When people don't cooperate,

00:14:43.587 --> 00:14:47.982
don't blame their mindsets,
their mentalities, their personality --

00:14:48.006 --> 00:14:50.157
look at the work situations.

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.374
Is it really in their personal interest
to cooperate or not,

00:14:55.398 --> 00:14:59.383
if, when they cooperate,
they are individually worse off?

00:14:59.914 --> 00:15:01.533
Why would they cooperate?

00:15:01.922 --> 00:15:05.514
When we blame personalities

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:11.696
instead of the clarity,
the accountability, the measurement,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.378
we add injustice to ineffectiveness.

00:15:17.654 --> 00:15:19.567
We need to create organizations

00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:23.905
in which it becomes individually useful
for people to cooperate.

00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:29.602
Remove the interfaces,
the middle offices --

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:32.684
all these complicated
coordination structures.

00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:37.953
Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.

00:15:37.977 --> 00:15:39.992
Fuzziness overlaps.

00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:45.724
Remove most of the quantitative metrics
to assess performance.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.732
Speed the "what."

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:51.231
Look at cooperation, the "how."

00:15:51.255 --> 00:15:52.856
How did you pass the baton?

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.442
Did you throw it,
or did you pass it effectively?

00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:04.627
Am I putting my energy
in what can get measured --

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:08.786
my legs, my speed --
or in passing the baton?

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:13.153
You, as leaders, as managers,

00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:18.729
are you making it individually useful
for people to cooperate?

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:23.343
The future of our organizations,

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:27.160
our companies, our societies

00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:32.277
hinges on your answer to these questions.

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.216
Thank you.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.725
(Applause)
