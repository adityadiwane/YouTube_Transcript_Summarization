00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:19.116
Over the past six months, I've spent my time

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:22.507
traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:25.429
but without leaving my desk.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.275
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.228
I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:35.629
and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.309
avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.118
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.180
if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.764
so it's important that we focus on outcomes.

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:50.697
And then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:53.165
"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.973
It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?"

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:59.066
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.130
So let's just walk our way through this.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.579
Please could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.761
The question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:07.907
The answer is?

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:10.631
Audience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.

00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:12.378
No, they're not the same. (Laughter)

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:16.007
They're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.316
So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.771
about that big, they played the same trick on us?

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.108
It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:27.255
And you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:31.091
You remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.971
The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,

00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:37.540
you say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.707
And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:44.005
Somebody or something has changed the rules

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.062
about how our world works.

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.968
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:52.804
you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:55.419
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:58.091
they switched all the rules round, so that the way to

00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.683
successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:04.364
has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:08.644
— you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)

00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.454
Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:12.289
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.631
My simple idea is that what's happened is,

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.625
the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:23.670
so instead we spend our time responding rationally

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.843
to a world which we understand and recognize,

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:29.262
but which no longer exists.

00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:31.471
You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:36.375
So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:38.967
If you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.334
you'll discover something like 90,000 books.

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.138
If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:48.397
you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)

00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:51.582
Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:54.567
is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.690
or delivering benefits two years after its inception.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.703
It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives

00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:03.263
spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:07.323
which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.

00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:11.046
How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:12.823
the visions of how we're going to change the world,

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:15.448
the key thing is implementation. We have the vision.

00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:16.804
We've got to make it happen.

00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:19.796
We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:22.253
People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.

00:03:22.253 --> 00:03:27.150
However, if I use as an example a family of five

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.884
going on holiday, if you can imagine this,

00:03:29.884 --> 00:03:34.284
all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,

00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:38.193
what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:41.324
What actually happens is, if I compare this to the average

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:47.111
real project, average real successful project,

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:51.337
the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:54.354
at a cost of 4,000 pounds,

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:57.059
whilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:01.394
What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:05.679
It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.253
This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:11.596
It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty,

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:15.102
the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity

00:04:15.102 --> 00:04:18.865
of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:22.263
and the number of bright minds," or something like that.

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:26.071
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:28.076
when she asked the question,

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:31.015
"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)

00:04:31.015 --> 00:04:34.518
I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:36.746
That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:40.208
these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:43.724
on the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)

00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:48.271
It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.173
he explains that design must get big, and he's right.

00:04:52.173 --> 00:04:54.792
He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:57.094
must tackle big systems for the challenges we have.

00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.231
He's absolutely right.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.904
And then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:06.766
Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.899
is cross-functional working is so amazing,

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.125
why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:18.406
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:22.492
we've not noticed that change I described earlier.

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:25.270
What we do know is that the world has accelerated.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.592
Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.064
Technology accelerates things exponentially.

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:32.226
So if this is now, and that's the past,

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:33.596
and we start thinking about change, you know,

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:36.167
all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.838
everybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:43.281
So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:47.377
The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.

00:05:47.377 --> 00:05:50.048
At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:52.697
We've doubled the population in 40 years,

00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:56.311
put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.

00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.180
The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.032
There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:05.666
And then we've done a third thing.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.661
you know, for those of you who have as an office

00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:13.130
a little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.521
no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.

00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.435
What's happened is, we've changed the scale.

00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:25.382
Size and scale are no longer the same.

00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:28.604
And then add to that, every time you tweet,

00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:31.394
over a third of your followers follow from a country

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:34.302
which is not your own.

00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:37.311
Global is the new scale. We know that.

00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:41.323
And so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:44.084
And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?

00:06:44.084 --> 00:06:47.217
And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.

00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:50.434
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember

00:06:50.434 --> 00:06:54.425
going to a demonstration where they basically,

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:56.836
the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.

00:06:56.836 --> 00:07:02.018
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? —

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:05.434
he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,

00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:08.609
you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap

00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:11.324
and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.

00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:14.522
Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)

00:07:14.522 --> 00:07:18.324
Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.

00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:20.945
And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:24.066
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:28.184
So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.

00:07:28.184 --> 00:07:31.896
And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:34.072
and he connects this to a container, and he fills

00:07:34.072 --> 00:07:37.393
the container up with green ink. You with me?

00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:41.183
So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out

00:07:41.183 --> 00:07:45.529
as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.821
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:53.007
So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.

00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:55.874
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.

00:07:55.874 --> 00:08:01.030
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.005
the whole of that green line disappears, and instead

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:07.365
there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:10.529
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:14.213
so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:18.226
What's happened in this world of pipe

00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:22.153
is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.

00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:25.834
All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:29.953
all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:32.795
and it's not the same as laminar.

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:37.753
And if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.

00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:41.050
And I think this is our challenge, because somebody

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.154
has actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —

00:08:45.154 --> 00:08:49.135
the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.

00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:50.834
Now how do we cope and deal with that?

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:54.267
Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:59.365
Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when

00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:02.169
there were actually these things called correct answers,

00:09:02.169 --> 00:09:05.330
because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.143
and you believe it will last forever.

00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:10.570
So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.745
and that's how we used to do it. We could see things,

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:15.258
understand them, take the time to put them into practice.

00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:19.107
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace

00:09:19.107 --> 00:09:22.352
of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work

00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:24.898
for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.844
on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:30.449
and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:35.817
If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.

00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:38.552
And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,

00:09:38.552 --> 00:09:40.939
it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:44.562
for the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:50.114
So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:54.311
You with me? This point over here, the point at which

00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:58.214
the lines cross over, the pace of change

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:01.358
overtakes the pace of learning,

00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:04.243
and for me, that is what I was describing

00:10:04.243 --> 00:10:07.500
when I was telling you about midnight.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.661
So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,

00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:14.300
many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.036
without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,

00:10:17.036 --> 00:10:19.972
the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?

00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:22.492
If you haven't understood the world you're living in,

00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:26.108
it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.

00:10:26.108 --> 00:10:29.516
I'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:32.557
I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,

00:10:32.557 --> 00:10:35.861
so they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"

00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:38.788
But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:42.909
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because —

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:46.564
Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,

00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:49.029
over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:51.661
If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?

00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.797
Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.

00:10:54.797 --> 00:10:59.861
So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?

00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:02.564
The answer is, don't do things which are different.

00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:04.787
And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:07.399
You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:11.250
One, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.732
you're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.

00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:17.964
On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,

00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:19.944
you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?

00:11:19.944 --> 00:11:23.556
Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.

00:11:23.556 --> 00:11:27.044
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.

00:11:27.044 --> 00:11:29.773
So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:33.597
of why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.

00:11:33.597 --> 00:11:35.637
When I realized the power of this new world,

00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:40.009
I quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:43.804
the first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:49.137
and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.

00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:52.186
If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,

00:11:52.186 --> 00:11:55.106
but I've applied them to myself for over a decade,

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:58.855
and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:04.235
I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,

00:12:04.235 --> 00:12:06.978
so that when you go away and you're making your next

00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:11.577
absolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,

00:12:11.577 --> 00:12:14.657
"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense

00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:17.440
in our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.490
(Applause)

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:30.919
Thank you, thank you. (Applause)
