00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:17.518
So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.590
former arts advocate,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.383
trained in architecture and art history,

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:26.517
and I want to talk to you today not about design

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:28.953
but about America

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:33.158
and how America can be more economically resilient,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.483
how America can be healthier,

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:37.136
and how America can be

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.754
more environmentally sustainable.

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:42.172
And I realize this is a global forum,

00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:44.241
but I think I need to talk about America

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.824
because there is a history,

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:47.511
in some places, not all,

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.961
of American ideas being appropriated,

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:52.493
being emulated, for better or for worse,

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:53.834
around the world.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.985
And the worst idea we've ever had

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:58.352
is suburban sprawl.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.723
It's being emulated in many places as we speak.

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.386
By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:06.790
of the landscape and the creation of the landscape

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.126
around the requirement of automobile use,

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:13.769
and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:17.520
has become a gas-belching,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120
time-wasting and life-threatening

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.553
prosthetic device

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:23.189
that many of us need just to,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.777
most Americans, in fact, need,

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:27.097
just to live their daily lives.

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:28.681
And there's an alternative.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.269
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.210
Well, in America, that living in cities,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.868
for many of them, they're living in cities still

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.134
where they're dependent on that automobile.

00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:39.113
And what I work for, and to do,

00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:41.799
is to make our cities more walkable.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.322
But I can't give design arguments for that

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.011
that will have as much impact

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:47.927
as the arguments that I've learned

00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:51.444
from the economists, the epidemiologists

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.160
and the environmentalists.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.421
So these are the three arguments that I'm going

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.532
to give you quickly today.

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:59.016
When I was growing up in the '70s,

00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:02.651
the typical American spent one tenth of their income,

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.890
American family, on transportation.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.475
Since then, we've doubled the number of roads

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:11.252
in America, and we now spend one fifth

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:13.913
of our income on transportation.

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.974
Working families, which are defined as

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:17.898
earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:19.857
a year in America

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:22.361
are spending more now on transportation

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.599
than on housing, slightly more,

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.832
because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"

00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:30.250
finding homes further and further and further

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.177
from the city centers and from their jobs,

00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:35.702
so that they're locked in this, two, three hours,

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:37.899
four hours a day of commuting.

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.373
And these are the neighborhoods, for example,

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:41.795
in the Central Valley of California

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.902
that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:47.124
and when the price of gas went up;

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:49.392
they were decimated.

00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:50.658
And in fact, these are many

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:53.261
of the half-vacant communities that you see today.

00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:56.442
Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.515
it goes underwater, and you have to pay

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:02.380
twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.100
So we know what it's done to our society

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.431
and all the extra work we have to do

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:09.200
to support our cars.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.932
What happens when a city decides

00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:13.206
it's going to set other priorities?

00:03:13.206 --> 00:03:15.178
And probably the best example we have here

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:17.589
in America is Portland, Oregon.

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.928
Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s

00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:22.626
that began to distinguish it

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:25.162
from almost every other American city.

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:27.280
While most other cities were growing

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.415
an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.090
they instituted an urban growth boundary.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.260
While most cities were reaming out their roads,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.505
removing parallel parking and trees

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:39.706
in order to flow more traffic,

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:43.439
they instituted a skinny streets program.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.353
And while most cities were investing in more roads

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:50.262
and more highways, they actually invested

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.739
in bicycling and in walking.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.804
And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:58.237
which seems like a lot of money,

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.753
but it was spent over about 30 years,

00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:03.122
so two million dollars a year -- not that much --

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:05.447
and half the price of the one cloverleaf

00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:08.266
that they decided to rebuild in that city.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.235
These changes and others like them changed

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.197
the way that Portlanders live,

00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.358
and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:15.917
the amount that each person drives,

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.230
actually peaked in 1996,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.331
has been dropping ever since,

00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:22.395
and they now drive 20 percent less

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.828
than the rest of the country.

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:26.584
The typical Portland citizen drives

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:30.552
four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day

00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:32.874
than they did before.

00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.861
The economist Joe Cortright did the math

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:36.379
and he found out that those four miles

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:37.811
plus those 11 minutes

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.733
adds up to fully three and a half percent

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:42.263
of all income earned in the region.

00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:44.139
So if they're not spending that money on driving --

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.752
and by the way, 85 percent of the money

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.346
we spend on driving leaves the local economy --

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:50.221
if they're not spending that money on driving,

00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:51.992
what are they spending it on?

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:53.669
Well, Portland is reputed to have

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.591
the most roof racks per capita,

00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.431
the most independent bookstores per capita,

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.675
the most strip clubs per capita.

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:05.311
These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations

00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.950
of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.148
spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds

00:05:10.148 --> 00:05:12.174
than the rest of America.

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.489
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:15.829
than most other states,

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:17.394
which may be a good thing or a bad thing,

00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:19.393
but it makes you glad they're driving less.

00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:21.766
(Laughter)

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:25.102
But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,

00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:27.645
and home investment is about as local

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.783
an investment as you can get.

00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:31.194
But there's a whole other Portland story,

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:32.739
which isn't part of this calculus,

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:35.626
which is that young, educated people

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:38.078
have been moving to Portland in droves,

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:40.596
so that between the last two censuses,

00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:42.878
they had a 50-percent increase

00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:44.742
in college-educated millennials,

00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:46.926
which is five times what you saw anywhere else

00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.202
in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.

00:05:50.202 --> 00:05:54.515
So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents

00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:57.095
by being more walkable and more bikeable,

00:05:57.095 --> 00:05:59.930
but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.748
that people want to be in these days.

00:06:02.748 --> 00:06:04.141
So the best economic strategy

00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:05.544
you can have as a city

00:06:05.544 --> 00:06:09.258
is not the old way of trying to attract corporations

00:06:09.258 --> 00:06:11.590
and trying to have a biotech cluster

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.684
or a medical cluster,

00:06:13.684 --> 00:06:15.093
or an aerospace cluster,

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:18.193
but to become a place where people want to be.

00:06:18.193 --> 00:06:21.671
And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.512
64 percent of whom decide first

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:25.791
where they want to live,

00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.807
then they move there, then they look for a job,

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:30.752
they will come to your city.

00:06:30.752 --> 00:06:33.613
The health argument is a scary one,

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:36.107
and you've probably heard part of this argument before.

00:06:36.107 --> 00:06:39.074
Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,

00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:42.184
back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.

00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:45.783
Now one out of three Americans is obese,

00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:49.650
and a second third of the population is overweight.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.529
Twenty-five percent of young men

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.450
and 40 percent of young women are too heavy

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.101
to enlist in our own military forces.

00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:59.479
According to the Center for Disease Control,

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.276
fully one third of all children born after 2000

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.976
will get diabetes.

00:07:04.976 --> 00:07:06.949
We have the first generation of children in America

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.819
who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.030
I believe that this American healthcare crisis

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.468
that we've all heard about

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:17.084
is an urban design crisis,

00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:19.896
and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.

00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:22.461
Because we've talked a long time about diet,

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:25.215
and we know that diet impacts weight,

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:27.527
and weight of course impacts health.

00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:30.298
But we've only started talking about inactivity,

00:07:30.298 --> 00:07:33.490
and how inactivity born of our landscape,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.820
inactivity that comes from the fact that we live

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.689
in a place where there is no longer any such thing

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:41.285
as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.

00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:42.859
And we finally have the studies,

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:45.545
one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"

00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:48.246
that tracked weight against diet

00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:50.151
and tracked weight against inactivity,

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.854
and found a much higher, stronger correlation

00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:54.902
between the latter two.

00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:56.919
Dr. James Levine at, in this case,

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:59.112
the aptly-named Mayo Clinic

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:03.651
put his test subjects in electronic underwear,

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.644
held their diet steady,

00:08:05.644 --> 00:08:07.648
and then started pumping the calories in.

00:08:07.648 --> 00:08:09.145
Some people gained weight,

00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:10.522
some people didn't gain weight.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:13.988
Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,

00:08:13.988 --> 00:08:15.692
they were shocked to learn that the only difference

00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:17.574
between the subjects that they could figure out

00:08:17.574 --> 00:08:19.458
was the amount they were moving,

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.098
and that in fact those who gained weight

00:08:21.098 --> 00:08:24.850
were sitting, on average, two hours more per day

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.166
than those who didn't.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:28.109
So we have these studies that tie

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:30.423
weight to inactivity, but even more,

00:08:30.423 --> 00:08:32.938
we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.

00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:34.571
Do you live in a more walkable city

00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.007
or do you live in a less walkable city,

00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:37.931
or where in your city do you live?

00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:40.596
In San Diego, they used Walk Score --

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:42.953
Walk Score rates every address in America

00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:44.592
and soon the world

00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:46.981
in terms of how walkable it is --

00:08:46.981 --> 00:08:49.864
they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods

00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:51.557
and less walkable neighborhoods.

00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:54.359
Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:56.630
you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.953
If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,

00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.160
you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.998
So we have study after study now

00:09:02.998 --> 00:09:05.053
that's tying where you live

00:09:05.053 --> 00:09:07.440
to your health, particularly as in America,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.570
the biggest health crisis we have is this one

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.294
that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.

00:09:14.294 --> 00:09:16.017
And I learned a new word last week.

00:09:16.017 --> 00:09:19.647
They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."

00:09:19.647 --> 00:09:22.878
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.

00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:24.645
Now that's one thing, of course.

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:27.120
Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.247
in this country.

00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:29.905
You probably haven't thought that much about it.

00:09:29.905 --> 00:09:32.626
Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.531
three times what it was in the '90s,

00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:38.422
and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:40.434
American pollution does not come

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:42.742
from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,

00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.999
and the amount that people are driving in your city,

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.447
your urban VMT, is a good prediction

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:49.949
of the asthma problems in your city.

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:52.164
And then finally, in terms of driving,

00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:55.070
there's the issue of the single-largest killer

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.712
of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers

00:09:57.712 --> 00:09:59.806
of all people, is car crashes.

00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:01.308
And we take car crashes for granted.

00:10:01.308 --> 00:10:03.143
We figure it's a natural risk

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:04.725
of being on the road.

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:07.898
But in fact, here in America, 12 people

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:09.254
out of every 100,000

00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:11.352
die every year from car crashes.

00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:12.821
We're pretty safe here.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.207
Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.

00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:17.045
It's Japan, it's four per 100,000.

00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:19.614
Do you know where it's three per 100,000?

00:10:19.614 --> 00:10:21.339
New York City.

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:23.995
San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.

00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:26.055
Oh, so cities make us safer

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:28.224
because we're driving less?

00:10:28.224 --> 00:10:30.643
Tulsa: 14 per 100,000.

00:10:30.643 --> 00:10:33.884
Orlando: 20 per 100,000.

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.601
It's not whether you're in the city or not,

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.287
it's how is your city designed?

00:10:37.287 --> 00:10:41.119
Was it designed around cars or around people?

00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:42.889
Because if your city is designed around cars,

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:47.748
it's really good at smashing them into each other.

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:51.483
That's part of a much larger health argument.

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:53.752
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,

00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:55.993
because the environmentalists turned on a dime

00:10:55.993 --> 00:10:57.512
about 10 years ago.

00:10:57.512 --> 00:10:58.988
The environmental movement in America

00:10:58.988 --> 00:11:02.016
has historically been an anti-city movement

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:03.527
from Jefferson on.

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:05.882
"Cities are pestilential to the health,

00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:07.873
to the liberties, to the morals of man.

00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:09.983
If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,

00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:11.899
as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:13.314
as they are in Europe

00:11:13.314 --> 00:11:15.976
and take to eating one another as they do there."

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.707
He apparently had a sense of humor.

00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:20.760
And then the American environmental movement

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.870
has been a classically Arcadian movement.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.983
To become more environmental, we move into the country,

00:11:24.983 --> 00:11:27.651
we commune with nature, we build suburbs.

00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:31.674
But, of course, we've seen what that does.

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:33.880
The carbon mapping of America,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.767
where is the CO2 being emitted,

00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:37.696
for many years only

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:40.223
hammered this argument in more strongly.

00:11:40.223 --> 00:11:43.064
If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,

00:11:43.064 --> 00:11:44.579
any carbon map of the U.S.,

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.722
it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,

00:11:47.722 --> 00:11:50.178
hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,

00:11:50.178 --> 00:11:53.746
dark, peaceful in the countryside.

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.685
Until some economists said, you know,

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:58.131
is that the right way to measure CO2?

00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:00.117
There are only so many people in this country at any given time,

00:12:00.117 --> 00:12:02.204
and we can choose to live where perhaps

00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:03.843
we would have a lighter impact.

00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:06.636
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,

00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:09.240
and when they did that, the maps just flipped,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.259
coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:14.935
and red hot in these exurban

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:17.707
"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.

00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.660
So a fundamental shift, and now you have

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.424
environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser

00:12:22.424 --> 00:12:24.991
saying we are a destructive species.

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:27.157
If you love nature, the best thing you can do

00:12:27.157 --> 00:12:29.425
is stay the heck away from it,

00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:31.979
move to a city, and the denser the better,

00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:34.483
and the denser cities like Manhattan

00:12:34.483 --> 00:12:36.819
are the cities that perform the best.

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:40.968
So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:45.284
at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,

00:12:45.284 --> 00:12:48.758
consuming half of the electricity of Dallas.

00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:50.760
But of course, we can do better.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.872
Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:57.966
European cities consume half as much again.

00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:00.162
So obviously, we can do better,

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:03.531
and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.

00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:05.977
My final argument in this topic is that

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:09.631
I think we're trying to be green the wrong way,

00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:11.807
and I'm one of many people who believes that

00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:14.879
this focus on gadgets,

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:17.570
on accessorizing --

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.589
What can I add to my house,

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:21.701
what can I add to what I've already got

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:24.164
to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --

00:13:24.164 --> 00:13:26.105
has kind of dominated the discussion.

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.959
So I'm not immune to this.

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.494
My wife and I built a new house

00:13:29.494 --> 00:13:32.493
on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:34.595
and we did our best to clear the shelves

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:36.650
of the sustainability store.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.885
We've got the solar photovoltaic system,

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:41.334
solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,

00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:43.242
bamboo floors.

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:46.614
A log burning in my German high-tech stove

00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:49.303
apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon

00:13:49.303 --> 00:13:50.984
to the atmosphere than were it left alone

00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:53.096
to decompose in the forest.

00:13:53.096 --> 00:13:55.876
Yet all of these innovations --

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.763
That's what they said in the brochure.

00:13:57.763 --> 00:13:58.991
(Laughter)

00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.131
All of these innovations together

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:04.215
contribute a fraction of what we contribute

00:14:04.215 --> 00:14:06.120
by living in a walkable neighborhood

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.891
three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.090
We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.440
and you should do the same thing,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.820
but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.452
saves as much energy in a year

00:14:17.452 --> 00:14:20.386
as moving to a walkable city does in a week.

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:21.735
And we don't want to have this argument.

00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:23.943
Politicians and marketers are afraid

00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:27.676
of marketing green as a "lifestyle choice."

00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:30.593
You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:32.454
that they have to change their lifestyle.

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:35.618
But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life

00:14:35.618 --> 00:14:38.135
and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,

00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:41.466
something that would be better than what we have right now?

00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:43.977
Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,

00:14:43.977 --> 00:14:45.966
it's called the Mercer Survey.

00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:47.166
You may have heard of it.

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:50.348
They rank hundreds of nations worldwide

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.761
according to 10 criteria that they believe add up

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:57.860
to quality of life: health, economics, education,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.162
housing, you name it.

00:15:01.162 --> 00:15:03.550
There's six more. Short talk.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.339
(Laughter)

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.986
And it's very interesting to see that

00:15:07.986 --> 00:15:10.275
the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:14.037
number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects

00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:17.976
of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.

00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:19.698
The driving cities in the Sun Belt,

00:15:19.698 --> 00:15:22.867
the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,

00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:26.019
these cities are not appearing on the list.

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.837
But who's doing even better?

00:15:27.837 --> 00:15:30.173
The Canadian cities like Vancouver,

00:15:30.173 --> 00:15:32.497
where again, they're burning half the fuel.

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:35.308
And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,

00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:37.240
like Dusseldorf or Vienna,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.670
where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.525
And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.413
Is being more sustainble

00:15:44.413 --> 00:15:46.841
what gives you a higher quality of life?

00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:49.478
I would argue the same thing

00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:51.459
that makes you more sustainble

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:53.509
is what gives you a higher quality of life,

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:56.500
and that's living in a walkable neighborhood.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.979
So sustainability, which includes our wealth

00:16:00.979 --> 00:16:02.753
and our health

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:07.205
may not be a direct function of our sustainability.

00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:09.662
But particularly here in America,

00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:12.103
we are polluting so much

00:16:12.103 --> 00:16:14.779
because we're throwing away our time

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:17.353
and our money and our lives on the highway,

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.577
then these two problems would seem to share

00:16:19.577 --> 00:16:22.211
the same solution, which is to make our cities

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:23.554
more walkable.

00:16:23.554 --> 00:16:26.201
Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done,

00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:27.629
it has been done,

00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:30.193
and it's being done now in more than a few cities,

00:16:30.193 --> 00:16:32.729
around the globe and in our country.

00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:35.791
I take some solace from Winston Churchill,

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.161
who put it this way:

00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:38.939
"The Americans can be counted on

00:16:38.939 --> 00:16:40.214
to do the right thing

00:16:40.214 --> 00:16:42.963
once they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter)

00:16:42.963 --> 00:16:44.959
Thank you.

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:51.317
(Applause)
