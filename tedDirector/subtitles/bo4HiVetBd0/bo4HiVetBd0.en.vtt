00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I want to share with you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
some ideas about the secret power of time,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
in a very short time.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.330
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
15 seconds studio.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
10, nine, eight, seven,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:52.330
six, five, four, three, two ...

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
of the principals in Adam's temptation.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
"I don't know, guys.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
I don't want to get in trouble."

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.330
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
(Laughter)

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
present focus and future focus.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
thank you George Bush --

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And most of them did so without using birth control.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
So much for promises.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
went back 14 years later,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
to try to discover what was different about those kids.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
and kids who yielded, in many ways.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.330
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
the key for you,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
Time perspective is the study of how individuals,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
into time zones or time categories.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
They vary between cultures, between nations,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
between individuals, between social classes,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
between education levels.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
And the problem is that they can become biased,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
What determines any decision you make?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
we're going to call them "present-oriented,"

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
because their focus is what is now.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
For others, the present is irrelevant.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
So that their decisions are based on past memories.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
For others it's not the past, it's not the present,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
it's only about the future.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
Cost-benefit analysis.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
So, time paradox, I want to argue,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
the paradox of time perspective,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
is something that influences every decision you make,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
you're totally unaware of.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
biased time perspectives.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.330
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
You can be present-hedonistic,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
Or you can be transcendental future:

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
namely, life begins after death.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
depending on the demands of the situation,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
that's what you've got to learn to do.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And moderate on present-hedonism.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
And always low on past-negative

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and present-fatalism.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
What you get from the future is wings

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
to soar to new destinations, new challenges.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
What you get from the present hedonism

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.330
places, people, sensuality.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
What do futures sacrifice for success?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.330
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.330
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And they live for work, achievement and control.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
(Laughter)

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
I'm here as a future-oriented person

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
Told me don't eat that marshmallow,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
until I learned to balance out.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.330
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
and I'm happier than I have ever been.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
changing the drop-out rates of school kids,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
combating addictions, enhancing teen health,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
promoting sustainability and conservation,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
So I want to end by saying:

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
many of life's puzzles can be solved

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
And the idea is so simple, so obvious,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
but I think the consequences are really profound.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
Thank you so much.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.330
(Applause)
