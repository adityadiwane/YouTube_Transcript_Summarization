00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.306
My name is Joseph,
a Member of Parliament in Kenya.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.305
Picture a Maasai village,

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.496
and one evening,

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.305
government soldiers come,
surround the village

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.521
and ask each elder to bring
one boy to school.

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.306
That's how I went to school --

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
pretty much a government guy
pointing a gun

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:35.593
and told my father,
"You have to make a choice."

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:38.306
I walked very comfortably
to this missionary school,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.306
that was run by an American missionary.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.306
The first thing the American missionary
gave me was a candy.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.306
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.950
So I said to myself,
with all these hundred other boys,

00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:49.335
this is where I belong.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.161
(Laughter) I stayed.

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.306
When everybody else was dropping out.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.050
My family moved; we're nomads.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.027
It was a boarding school, I was seven --

00:00:57.052 --> 00:00:59.740
Every time it closed
you had to travel to find them.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.306
40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
You slept in the bush, but you kept going.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:06.306
And I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.306
All of a sudden I passed
the national examination,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.306
found myself in a very beautiful
high school in Kenya.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.082
And I finished high school.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.055
And just walking, I found a man

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.679
who gave me a full scholarship
to the United States.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.964
My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:24.011
none of my brothers were going to school,

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.306
and this man told me, "Here, go."

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.365
I got a scholarship

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:30.028
to St. Lawrence University,
Upstate New York;

00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:31.092
finished that.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:35.255
And after that I went
to Harvard Graduate School;

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.518
finished that.

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:38.726
Then I worked in DC a little bit:

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.812
I wrote a book for National Geographic
and taught U.S. history.

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:44.306
And every time, I kept going back home,

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:45.955
listening to their problems --

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.525
sick people, people
with no water, all this stuff --

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.134
every time I go back to America,

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:51.945
I kept thinking about them.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.008
Then one day, an elder gave me
a story that went like this:

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:59.593
long time ago, there was a big war
between tribes.

00:01:59.854 --> 00:02:03.305
This specific tribe was really afraid
of this other Luhya tribe.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.412
Every time, they sent scouts
to make sure no one attacked them.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.857
So one day, the scouts came running
and told the villagers,

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:13.025
"The enemies are coming.
Only half an hour away, they'll be here."

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.563
So people scrambled, took their things
and ready to go, move out.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.635
But there were two men:

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.128
one man was blind, one man had no legs

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:22.456
-- he was born like that.

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:26.378
The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry.
We can't take you. You'll slow us down.

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:29.892
We have to flee our women
and children, we have to run."

00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:33.038
And they were left behind, waiting to die.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.305
But these two people worked something out.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.473
The blind man said, "Look,
I'm a very strong man but I can't see."

00:02:39.497 --> 00:02:42.783
The man with no legs says,
"I can see as far as the end of the world,

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:47.306
but I can't save myself
from a cat, or whatever animals."

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:51.306
The blind man went down
on his knees like this,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.378
and told the man with no legs
to go over his back, and stood up.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.306
The man on top can see,
the blind man can walk.

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.977
These guys took off, followed
the footsteps of the villagers

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.068
until they found and passed them.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.306
So, this was told to me
in a setup of elders.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.025
And it's a really poor area.

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.504
I represent Northern Kenya:

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.083
the most nomadic, remote areas
you can even find.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.306
And that man told me, "So, here you are.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.822
You've got a good education from America,
you have a good life in America;

00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:24.093
what are you going to do for us?

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:28.306
We want you to be our eyes,
we'll give you the legs.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.306
We'll walk you, you lead us."

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:33.351
The opportunity came.
I was always thinking about that:

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:35.306
"What can I do to help my people?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.676
Every time you go to an area
where for 43 years of independence,

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.242
we still don't have
basic health facilities.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:44.393
A man has to be transported
in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.

00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:45.703
No clean drinking water.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.305
So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.576
I'm leaving America.

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.409
I'm going to run for office."

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:54.957
Last June, I moved from America,

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.395
ran in July election and won.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:01.767
And I came for them,

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:03.583
and that's my goal.

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:06.040
Right now I have in place,
for the last nine months,

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:09.910
a plan that in five years,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.303
every nomad will have
clean drinking water.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.750
We're building dispensaries
across that constituency.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.049
I'm asking my friends from America to help

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.306
with bringing nurses
or doctors to help us out.

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:24.665
I'm trying to improve infrastructure.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:27.981
I'm using the knowledge
I received from the United States

00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:29.052
and from my community

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:31.058
to move them forward.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.540
I'm trying to develop
homegrown solutions to our issues

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.130
because people from outside
can come and help us,

00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:39.748
but if we don't help ourselves,
there's nothing to do.

00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:41.345
My plan right now

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.304
as I continue with introducing
students to different fields --

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.179
some become doctors, some lawyers --

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.599
we want to produce
a comprehensive group of people,

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.479
students who can come back
and help us see a community grow

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:55.812
that is in the middle
of a huge economic recession.

00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:58.939
As I continue to be
a Member of Parliament

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:02.330
and as I continue listening
to all of you talking about botany,

00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:05.330
health, democracy, new inventions,

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.306
I'm hoping that one day
in my own little community --

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.306
which is 26,000 square km,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.197
maybe five times Rhode Island --

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.491
with no roads,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.909
we'll be able to become a model
to help others develop.

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:19.294
Thank you very much.

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.318
(Applause)
