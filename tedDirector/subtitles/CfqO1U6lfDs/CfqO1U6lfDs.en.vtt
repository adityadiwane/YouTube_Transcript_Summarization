00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.196
A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:16.825
a flock of birds.

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.893
Many animals gather in large groups

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.879
that are among the most wonderful spectacles

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.597
in the natural world.

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.321
But why do these groups form?

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.958
The common answers include things like

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.924
seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:32.420
or gathering to mate or breed,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.088
and all of these explanations,

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.325
while often true,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.368
make a huge assumption about animal behavior,

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:41.545
that the animals are in control of their own actions,

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.796
that they are in charge of their bodies.

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:47.223
And that is often not the case.

00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:50.147
This is Artemia, a brine shrimp.

00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:52.911
You probably know it better as a sea monkey.

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.906
It's small, and it typically lives alone,

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:57.983
but it can gather in these large red swarms

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.230
that span for meters,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.320
and these form because of a parasite.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.006
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.257
A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut

00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:11.145
with genitals at one end and
a hooked mouth at the other.

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.680
As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.835
(Laughter)

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.743
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.820
but it also does other things.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.440
It castrates them,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.158
it changes their color from transparent to bright red,

00:01:27.158 --> 00:01:28.674
it makes them live longer,

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:31.031
and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:34.390
it makes them swim in groups.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.842
Why? Because the tapeworm,
like many other parasites,

00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:39.423
has a complicated life cycle

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:41.687
involving many different hosts.

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:44.091
The shrimp are just one step on its journey.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.703
Its ultimate destination is this,

00:01:46.703 --> 00:01:48.650
the greater flamingo.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.675
Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.964
so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:58.055
into forming these conspicuous colored swarms

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.772
that are easier for a flamingo to spot

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.331
and to devour,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.263
and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:07.426
They aren't sociable through their own volition,

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.502
but because they are being controlled.

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:11.196
It's not safety in numbers.

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:13.055
It's actually the exact opposite.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:16.096
The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.492
turning them into vehicles

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:21.459
for getting itself into a flamingo.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.889
And here is another example

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.415
of a parasitic manipulation.

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:28.391
This is a suicidal cricket.

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.695
This cricket swallowed the 
larvae of a Gordian worm,

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.588
or horsehair worm.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.744
The worm grew to adult size within it,

00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:38.782
but it needs to get into water in order to mate,

00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:41.000
and it does that by releasing proteins

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.188
that addle the cricket's brain,

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:45.352
causing it to behave erratically.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:47.307
When the cricket nears a body of water,

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:48.926
such as this swimming pool,

00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:51.183
it jumps in and drowns,

00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:52.908
and the worm wriggles out

00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:56.764
of its suicidal corpse.

00:02:56.764 --> 00:03:00.367
Crickets are really roomy. Who knew?

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.582
The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.302
They are part of an entire cavalcade

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:07.379
of mind-controlling parasites,

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.328
of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:13.901
that all specialize in subverting and overriding

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.110
the wills of their hosts.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.847
Now, I first learned about this way of life

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:20.340
through David Attenborough's "Trials of Life"

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.062
about 20 years ago,

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:23.764
and then later through a wonderful book called

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:26.438
"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:28.581
And I've been writing about
these creatures ever since.

00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:31.392
Few topics in biology enthrall me more.

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:35.098
It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:37.709
Because after all, they are always compelling

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.997
and they are delightfully macabre.

00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:40.389
When you write about parasites,

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.473
your lexicon swells with phrases like

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:45.519
"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body."

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.756
(Laughter)

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:48.296
But there's more to it than that.

00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:50.398
I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience

00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:53.107
will know that we love stories.

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.500
Parasites invite us to resist the allure

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.350
of obvious stories.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.660
Their world is one of plot twists

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.267
and unexpected explanations.

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.763
Why, for example,

00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:06.941
does this caterpillar

00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.915
start violently thrashing about

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.583
when another insect gets close to it

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.840
and those white cocoons that it seems

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.278
to be standing guard over?

00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:17.374
Is it maybe protecting its siblings?

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:18.823
No.

00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:20.280
This caterpillar was attacked

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.499
by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:24.933
The eggs hatched and the young wasps

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.247
devoured the caterpillar alive

00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:27.918
before bursting out of its body.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:30.193
See what I mean?

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:33.031
Now, the caterpillar didn't die.

00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.616
Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:38.953
and controlled it into defending their siblings

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:40.587
which are metamorphosing

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:42.607
into adults within those cocoons.

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:46.146
This caterpillar is a head-banging 
zombie bodyguard

00:04:46.146 --> 00:04:47.447
defending the offspring

00:04:47.447 --> 00:04:49.669
of the creature that killed it.

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.535
(Applause)

00:04:53.535 --> 00:04:57.830
We have a lot to get through. 
I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.641
Now, some of you are probably just

00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.859
desperately clawing for some solace

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:04.119
in the idea that these things are oddities

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.050
of the natural world, that they are outliers,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.870
and that point of view is understandable,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.248
because by their nature, parasites are quite small

00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:11.588
and they spend a lot of their time

00:05:11.588 --> 00:05:14.542
inside the bodies of other things.

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:16.313
They're easy to overlook,

00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:18.898
but that doesn't mean that they aren't important.

00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:21.103
A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty

00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:24.472
took a group of scientists
into three Californian estuaries

00:05:24.472 --> 00:05:26.220
and they pretty much weighed and dissected

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.215
and recorded everything they could find,

00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:29.443
and what they found

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:32.659
were parasites in extreme abundance.

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.703
Especially common were trematodes,

00:05:34.703 --> 00:05:37.353
tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.899
like this unfortunate snail.

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.788
Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:44.587
but collectively they weighed as much

00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:46.773
as all the fish in the estuaries

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:50.480
and three to nine times more than all the birds.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.474
And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:53.862
the cricket thing?

00:05:53.862 --> 00:05:56.415
One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato

00:05:56.415 --> 00:05:58.111
found that in one stream,

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:00.082
these things drive so many crickets

00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:01.381
and grasshoppers into the water

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:02.690
that the drowned insects

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.994
make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:09.928
Manipulation is not an oddity.

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:12.048
It is a critical and common part

00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:13.939
of the world around us,

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.460
and scientists have now found

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.942
hundreds of examples of such manipulators,

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:20.379
and more excitingly, they're starting to understand

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.437
exactly how these creatures control their hosts.

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:26.961
And this is one of my favorite examples.

00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.418
This is Ampulex compressa,

00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:31.642
the emerald cockroach wasp,

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:33.936
and it is a truth universally acknowledged

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:35.579
that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:37.375
of some fertilized eggs

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.841
must be in want of a cockroach.

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:41.041
When she finds one,

00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:43.252
she stabs it with a stinger

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:44.701
that is also a sense organ.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:47.372
This discovery came out three weeks ago.

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:49.677
She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.471
equipped with small sensory bumps

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.026
that allow her to feel the distinctive texture

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.133
of a roach's brain.

00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:59.174
So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,

00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:01.651
she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom

00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:05.852
into two very specific clusters of neurons.

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:08.935
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal

00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:12.660
found that the venom is a
very specific chemical weapon.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.204
It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.

00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:17.331
The roach could walk away

00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:20.356
or fly or run if it chose to,

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.231
but it doesn't choose to,

00:07:22.231 --> 00:07:25.611
because the venom nixes its motivation to walk,

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.725
and only that.

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:30.431
The wasp basically un-checks
the escape-from-danger box

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.271
in the roach's operating system,

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.504
allowing her to lead her helpless victim

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:37.615
back to her lair by its antennae

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:40.254
like a person walking a dog.

00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:41.931
And once there, she lays an egg on it,

00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.207
egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:46.396
yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:49.626
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:52.506
Now I would argue that, once stung,

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:54.511
the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.

00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:56.861
It's more of an extension of the wasp,

00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:59.704
just like the cricket was an
extension of the Gordian worm.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:02.519
These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:04.318
They have as much control over their own fates

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.102
as my car.

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.602
Once the parasites get in,

00:08:07.602 --> 00:08:10.167
the hosts don't get a say.

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.481
Now humans, of course,

00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:13.513
are no stranger to manipulation.

00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:15.873
We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.004
and to change our moods,

00:08:17.004 --> 00:08:21.024
and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:24.727
if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?

00:08:24.727 --> 00:08:26.254
But our attempts at doing this

00:08:26.254 --> 00:08:28.032
are crude and blundering compared

00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:31.127
to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:33.519
Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:38.479
and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.219
Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:45.005
so sinister and so compelling.

00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:47.627
We place such a premium on our free will

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.888
and our independence

00:08:48.888 --> 00:08:50.469
that the prospect of losing those qualities

00:08:50.469 --> 00:08:51.747
to forces unseen

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:54.915
informs many of our deepest societal fears.

00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:57.368
Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals

00:08:57.368 --> 00:08:59.222
and mind-controlling supervillains --

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:02.250
these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.048
but in nature, they happen all the time.

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:09.680
Which leads me to an obvious

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.980
and disquieting question:

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.703
Are there dark, sinister parasites

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.659
that are influencing our behavior

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:17.234
without us knowing about it,

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:20.053
besides the NSA?

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:21.360
If there are any —

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.326
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:27.648
I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?

00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:30.175
(Laughter)

00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:33.129
If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:36.407
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:37.996
because the terrifying creature

00:09:37.996 --> 00:09:40.206
always deserves a cute nickname.

00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:42.488
Toxo infects mammals,

00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:43.966
a wide variety of mammals,

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:47.047
but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.

00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:49.808
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that

00:09:49.808 --> 00:09:52.001
if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:55.473
it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.

00:09:55.473 --> 00:09:58.549
If the infected rat smells the delightful odor

00:09:58.549 --> 00:09:59.773
of cat piss,

00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:02.493
it runs towards the source of the smell

00:10:02.493 --> 00:10:06.412
rather than the more sensible direction of away.

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:08.947
The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.

00:10:08.947 --> 00:10:11.819
It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:16.487
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:22.714
You're very charitable, generous people.

00:10:22.714 --> 00:10:25.299
Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:28.667
How does the parasite control its host

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:29.871
in this way?

00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:31.197
We don't really know.

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.885
We know that Toxo releases an enzyme

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:34.877
that makes dopamine, a substance involved

00:10:34.877 --> 00:10:36.690
in reward and motivation.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.121
We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,

00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:41.586
including those involved in sexual arousal.

00:10:41.586 --> 00:10:43.787
But how those puzzle pieces fit together

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:45.631
is not immediately clear.

00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.927
What is clear is that this thing

00:10:47.927 --> 00:10:49.319
is a single cell.

00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:50.689
This has no nervous system.

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:51.821
It has no consciousness.

00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:53.122
It doesn't even have a body.

00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:55.746
But it's manipulating a mammal?

00:10:55.746 --> 00:10:57.172
We are mammals.

00:10:57.172 --> 00:10:59.606
We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:02.130
but our brains have the same basic structure,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.523
the same types of cells,

00:11:03.523 --> 00:11:05.111
the same chemicals running through them,

00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:07.430
and the same parasites.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.778
Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest

00:11:09.778 --> 00:11:12.138
that one in three people around the world

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.851
have Toxo in their brains.

00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:17.339
Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:19.217
The parasite holds up in a dormant state

00:11:19.217 --> 00:11:21.400
for a long period of time.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.439
But there's some evidence that those people

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:26.473
who are carriers score slightly differently

00:11:26.473 --> 00:11:29.202
on personality questionnaires than other people,

00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:31.686
that they have a slightly 
higher risk of car accidents,

00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:34.289
and there's some evidence
that people with schizophrenia

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:36.835
are more likely to be infected.

00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:39.018
Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,

00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:40.929
and even among Toxo researchers,

00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:43.369
opinion is divided as to whether the parasite

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.754
is truly influencing our behavior.

00:11:45.754 --> 00:11:48.413
But given the widespread
nature of such manipulations,

00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:50.258
it would be completely implausible

00:11:50.258 --> 00:11:51.907
for humans to be the only species

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:54.853
that weren't similarly affected.

00:11:54.853 --> 00:11:59.246
And I think that this capacity to constantly

00:11:59.246 --> 00:12:02.113
subvert our way of thinking about the world

00:12:02.113 --> 00:12:03.660
makes parasites amazing.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.869
They're constantly inviting us to
look at the natural world sideways,

00:12:06.869 --> 00:12:09.040
and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.527
whether they're simple and obvious

00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:12.060
or baffling and puzzling,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.146
are not the results of individuals

00:12:14.146 --> 00:12:15.999
acting through their own accord

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:17.808
but because they are being bent

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:20.478
to the control of something else.

00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:22.518
And while that idea may be disquieting,

00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:25.441
and while parasites' habits may be very grisly,

00:12:25.441 --> 00:12:27.233
I think that ability to surprise us

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:30.408
makes them as wonderful and as charismatic

00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:33.772
as any panda or butterfly or dolphin.

00:12:33.772 --> 00:12:35.991
At the end of "On the Origin of Species,"

00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:38.980
Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.633
and of endless forms most beautiful

00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:43.065
and most wonderful,

00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:45.644
and I like to think he could easily have been talking

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:48.824
about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable

00:12:48.824 --> 00:12:52.073
or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.

00:12:52.073 --> 00:12:55.222
But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.

00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:56.953
Thank you.

00:12:56.953 --> 00:13:00.953
(Applause)
