00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.056
I believe big institutions

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.696
have unique potential to create change,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.696
and I believe that we as individuals

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.016
have unique power

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760
to influence the direction
that those institutions take.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.056
Now, these beliefs did not
come naturally to me,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.656
because trusting big institutions,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.480
not really part of my family legacy.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.736
My mother escaped North Korea

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.616
when she was 10 years old.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.656
To do so, she had to elude
every big institution in her life:

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.536
repressive governments, occupying armies

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.480
and even armed border patrols.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.416
Later, when she decided she wanted
to emigrate to the United States,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.496
she had to defy an entire culture

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.040
that said the girls would never
be the best and brightest.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.616
Only because her name
happens to sound like a boy's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.896
was she able to finagle her way
into the government immigration exam

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.520
to come to the United States.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.976
Because of her bravery and passion,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.856
I've had all the opportunities
that she never did,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.400
and that has made my story so different.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.456
Instead of running away
from big institutions,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.296
I've actually run toward them.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.576
I've had the chance
over the course of my career

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.416
to work for The Wall Street Journal,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.656
the White House

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.656
and now one of the largest
financial institutions in the world,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.816
where I lead sustainable investing.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.256
Now, these institutions are like tankers,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.696
and working inside of them,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.336
I've come to appreciate
what large wakes they can leave,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.656
and I've become convinced

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.416
that the institution
of the global capital markets,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.336
the nearly 290 trillion dollars
of stocks and bonds in the world,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.216
that that may be one
of our most powerful forces

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.816
for positive social change
at our disposal,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.080
if we ask it to be.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.776
Now, I know some of you are thinking,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.296
global capital markets,
positive social change,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.136
not usually in the same sentence
or even the same paragraph.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.496
I think many people think
of the capital markets

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.816
kind of like an ocean.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.656
It's a vast, impersonal,
uncaring force of nature

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.336
that is not affected
by our wishes or desires.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.696
So the best that our
little savings accounts

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.416
or retirement accounts can do

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.016
is to try to catch some waves
in the good cycles

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.801
and hope that we don't get
inundated in the turbulent ones,

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:25.056
but certainly our decisions on how
to steer our little retirement accounts

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.576
don't affect the tides,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.000
don't change the shape or size
or direction of the waves.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.016
But why is that?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.376
Because actually,
one third of this ocean of capital

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.016
actually belongs to individuals like us,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.096
and most of the rest
of the capital markets

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.336
is controlled by the institutions
that get their power and authority

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.136
and their capital from us,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.296
as members, participants,
beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160
So if we are the ultimate owners
of the capital markets,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.360
why aren't we able
to make our voices heard?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.920
Why can't we make some waves?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.856
So let me ask you a different question:

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.096
did any of you buy fair trade coffee

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.776
the last time you were
at a supermarket or at Starbucks?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.216
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.896
and order the sustainably farmed trout

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.456
instead of the miso-glazed
Chilean sea bass

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.200
that you really wish you could have?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.840
Do any of you drive hybrid cars
or even electric cars?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.536
So why do we do these things?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.416
Right? One electric car doesn't amount
to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.920
combustion engine vehicles.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.440
One fish is just one fish in the sea.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.336
And one cup of coffee

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.920
doesn't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.936
But we do these things
because we believe they matter,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.216
that our actions add up,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.136
that our choices might influence others

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.320
and collectively,
what an impact we can have.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.856
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug
that I bought a couple of years ago.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.816
It's a reusable mug.
It has all these things printed on it.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.936
Look at some of the things
that are on it, that it says.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.496
"This one cup can be used
again and again."

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.376
"This one cup may inspire others
to use one too."

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.696
"This one cup helps save the planet."

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.176
I had no idea this plastic cup
was so powerful.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.296
(Laughter)

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.216
So why do we think that our choice

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.056
of a four dollar shade-grown
fair trade artisanal cup of coffee

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.256
in a reusable mug matters,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.042
but what we do with 4,000 dollars
in our investment account

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:22.466
for our IRA doesn't?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.896
Why can't we tell the supermarket
and the capital markets

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.336
that we care,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.616
that we care about fair labor standards,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.976
that we care about sustainable
production methods

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.856
and about healthy communities?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.896
Why aren't we voting
with our investment dollars,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.560
but we would vote with our lattes?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.736
So I think it has something
to do with the myths,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.976
the fables that we all carry around
in our collective consciousness.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.576
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale
about the magic porridge pot?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.976
If you said to the pot,
"Boil, little pot, boil,"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.296
it would fill up with sweet porridge.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.416
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.640
it would stop.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.616
But if you got the words wrong,
it wouldn't listen,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
and things could go terribly awry.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.376
So I think when it comes to markets,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.896
we have a little bit
of a similar fable in our heads.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.256
We believe that the markets
is this magic pot

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.136
that obeys only one command:

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.200
make more money.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.816
Only those words said exactly that way

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.680
will make the pot fill up with gold.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.976
Add in some extra words
like "protect the environment,"

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.640
the spell might not work.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.160
Put in the wrong words
like "promote social justice,"

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.576
and you might see your gold coins shrink

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.440
or even vanish entirely,
according to this fable.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.216
So we asked people,
what do you really think?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.456
And we actually went out and polled
a thousand individual investors,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.496
and we found something fascinating.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.016
Overwhelmingly,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.656
people wanted to add
those extra words into the formula.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.736
71 percent of people said yes,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.336
they were interested
in sustainable investing,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.296
which we define as taking the best
in class investment process

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.056
that you already have traditionally

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.136
and adding in the extra
information you get

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.416
when you think about the environment
and society and good governance.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.176
71 percent wanted that.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.856
72 percent said that they believe
that companies who did that

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.696
would actually do better financially.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.376
So people really do believe
that you can do well by doing good.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.816
But here was the weird thing:

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.376
54 percent of the people

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.576
still said if they put their money
in those kinds of stocks,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.720
they thought that they
would make less money.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.496
So is it true?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.296
Do you get less sweet porridge
if you invest in shade-grown coffee

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.560
instead of drinking it?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.016
Well, you know, the investors
in companies like Burt's Bees

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.816
or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.816
Right? Both of those started out
as small, socially conscious companies

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.976
that ended up becoming
so popular with consumers

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.056
that the giants Unilever
and Clorox bought them

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.240
for hundreds of millions of dollars

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.080
each.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.376
But here's the important thing.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.736
Those corporations realized

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.696
that if they wanted to protect
the value of their investments,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.216
they had to preserve
that socially conscious mission.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.456
If they didn't keep adding in
those extra words

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.896
of environmentally friendly
and socially conscious,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.000
those brands wouldn't make more money.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.776
But maybe this is just the exception
the proves the rule, right?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.336
The serious companies
that fund our economy

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.656
and that fund our retirements
and that really make the world go round,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.120
they need to stick to making more money.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.656
So, Harvard Business School
actually researched this,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.442
and they found something fascinating.

00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:34.096
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.776
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.016
that focused narrowly on making more money

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.976
quarter by quarter,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.416
that one dollar

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.296
would have grown
to 14 dollars and 46 cents.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.576
That's not bad until you consider

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.616
that if instead
you'd invested that same dollar

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.296
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.130
that focused on growing their business

00:07:54.154 --> 00:07:57.394
and on the most important
environmental and social issues,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.216
that one dollar would have grown

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.680
to 28 dollars and 36 cents.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.136
almost twice as much sweet porridge.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.136
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make
that outperformance

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.056
by giving away money
to seem like a nice corporate citizen.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.296
They did it by focusing on the things
that matter to their business,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.736
like wasting less energy and water

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.536
in their manufacturing processes;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.936
like making sure the CEO contracts
had the CEOs incentivized

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.416
for the long-term results of the company
and the communities they served,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.816
not just quarterly results;

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.136
or building a first class culture

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.496
that would have higher employee loyalty,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.480
retention and productivity.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.736
Now, Harvard's not alone.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.776
Oxford also did a research study
where they examined 120 different studies

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.256
looking at the effect
of sustainability and economic results,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.056
and they found
time and time and time again

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.936
that the companies that cared
about these kinds of important things

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.000
actually had better
operational efficiency,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.416
lower cost of capital

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.680
and better performance
in their stock price.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.856
And then there's Al Gore.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.816
So 20 years ago, when I worked
for Al Gore in the White House,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.296
he was one of the early pioneers
pleading with businesses and governments

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.016
to pay attention to the challenges
of climate change.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.088
Post-White House, he opened
an investment firm called Generation,

00:09:13.112 --> 00:09:16.376
where he baked environmental
sustainability and other things

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.280
right into the core investment process.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.496
And at the time there was
a good bit of skepticism about his views.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.256
Ten years later, his track record
is one more proof point

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.976
that sustainable investing done right
can be sound investing.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.856
Far from making less sweet porridge

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.256
because he added
sustainability into the mix,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.960
he actually significantly
outperformed the benchmark.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.096
Now, sustainable investing,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.000
the good news is
it doesn't require a magic spell

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.096
and it doesn't require
some investment secret,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.696
and it's not just for the elite.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.216
It is not just about private equity
for billionaires.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.193
It's not just groovy-sounding investments
like clean technology

00:09:54.217 --> 00:09:55.913
or microfinance in emerging markets

00:09:55.937 --> 00:09:58.160
or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.016
It's about stocks and bonds
and Fortune 500 companies.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.256
It's about mutual funds.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.736
It's about all the things

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.920
we already see in the market today.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.496
So here's why I'm convinced

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.656
that we collectively have the power

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.760
to make sustainable investing
the new normal.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.776
First, the proof points
are coming out all the time

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.816
that sustainable investing done right,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.056
preserving all the same
good principles of investing,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.040
the traditional sphere, can pay.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.336
It makes sense.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.776
Secondly,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.936
the biggest obstacle standing in our way

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.000
may actually just be in our heads.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.576
We just need to let go of that myth

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.856
that if you add your values
into your investment thinking,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.496
that you get less sweet porridge.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.176
And once you get rid of the fable,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.656
you can actually start appreciating
those facts we've been talking about.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.656
And third, the future is already here.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.656
Sustainable investment today
is a 20 trillion dollar market

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.056
and it's the fastest-growing segment
of the investment industry.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.296
In the United States,
it has grown enormously, as you can see.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.016
It now represents
one out of every six dollars

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.440
under professional management
in the United States.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.720
So what are we waiting for?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.494
For me, it goes back to the inspiration
that I received from my mother.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.776
She knew that she wanted a life

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.440
where she would have the freedom
to make her own choices

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.496
and to have her voice heard
and write her own story.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.976
She was passionate about that goal

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.616
and she was clear that she would let
no army, no obstacle,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.160
no big institution stand in her way.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.896
She made it to the States,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.656
and she became a teacher,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.376
an award-winning author

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.656
and a mother,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.376
and ended up sending
her daughters to Harvard.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.496
And these days, you can tell
that she is amply comfortable

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.576
holding court in the most powerful
institutions in the world.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.496
It seems almost too prophetic

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.816
that her name in Korean means

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.120
"passionate clarity."

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.936
Passionate clarity:

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.736
that's what I think we need
to drive change.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.096
Passion about the change
we want to see in the world,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.760
and clarity that we are able
to help chart the course.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.496
We have more opportunity today
than ever before

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.760
to make choices.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.040
We have more power than ever before
to make our voices heard.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.120
So change your perspective.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.936
Vote with your small change.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.840
Invest in the change
you want to see in the world.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.576
Change the fables

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.840
and change the markets.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.496
Thank you.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.320
(Applause)
