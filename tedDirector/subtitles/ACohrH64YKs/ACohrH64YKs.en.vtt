00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Let me introduce to you Rezero.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
This little fellow was developed

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
by a group of 10 undergraduate students

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
at ETH-Zurich.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Our robot belongs to a family of robots

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
called Ballbots.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and moving on one single ball.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
The main characteristics of such a system is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that there's one sole contact point to the ground.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
This means that the robot

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
is inherently unstable.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
It's like when I am trying to stand

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.260
on one foot.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
of a robot that's unstable?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Now we'll explain that in a second.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Let me first explain how Rezero

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
actually keeps his balance.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
by turning the motors appropriately.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
This happens 160 times per second,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and if anything fails in this process,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now to move and to balance,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Rezero needs to turn the ball.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
The ball is driven by three special wheels

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
that allow Rezero to move into any direction

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and also move around his own axis

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
at the same time.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Due to his instability, Rezero is always

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
in motion. Now here's the trick.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
a robot to move very [dynamically].

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Let's play a little.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
You may have wondered what happens

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
if I give the robot a little push.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
In this mode, he's trying to maintain

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
his position.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and Thomas who's helping me onstage.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
In the next mode, Rezero is passive,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and we can move him around.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
With almost no force I can control

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
his position and his velocity.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I can also make him spin.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
In the next mode, we can get Rezero

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
to follow a person.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This works with a laser sensor

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that's mounted on top of Rezero.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
With the same method, we can also

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
get him to circle a person.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
We call this the orbiting mode.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
All right, thank you, Thomas.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Applause)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Now, what's the use of this technology?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
For now, it's an experiment, but let me

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
show you some possible future applications.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
With a screen it could inform people or show

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
them around in a fun and entertaining way.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
In a hospital, this device could be used to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
carry around medical equipment.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
footprint and it's also easy to move around.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And of course, who wouldn't like

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
to take a ride on one of these.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And these are more practical applications.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But there's also a certain beauty

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
within this technology.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.260
(Music)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.260
(Applause)

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Thank you.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
(Applause)

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Thank you.
