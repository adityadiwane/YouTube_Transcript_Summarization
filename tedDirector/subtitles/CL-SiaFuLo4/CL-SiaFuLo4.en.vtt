Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.436
or should we say, have a seat, mom.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.225
(Cheers)

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.156
So no doubt, you guys are like me.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.796
You saw the release of Serena

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.876
in that great yellow
bathing suit last week

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.316
and when I saw it,
all I could think of was,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.116
"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.076
I was very selfish, I know.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.756
So I asked you about that picture,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.556
and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.836
What do you mean?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.916
Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.716
I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.716
and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.076
and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going --

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.996
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.716
SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.756
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.356
to be quite honest,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.596
and I'd been saving it,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.876
and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and --

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.916
(Laughter)

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.556
GK: And there it was.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.476
SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much --

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.716
and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.076
and I'm like, that's weird,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.036
and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.276
But it was a good moment.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.996
I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.436
GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.316
so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.076
SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.436
I've been just tracking it.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.876
18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.636
and I've been so good about it,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.916
and this was the one time that I slipped.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.516
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.796
SW: Yes, thank you.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.956
GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.436
were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.996
That you were pregnant, I mean.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.996
SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.956
which is one of the biggest grand slams.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.636
GK: You found out two days before?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.316
SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.836
I was nervous.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.516
I wasn't quite sure what to think,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.276
but I just knew that at that moment

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.356
it was really important for me
to just focus right there

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.636
at the Australian Open,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.916
and I was definitely not sure what to do.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.316
I was like, can I play?

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.796
I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.676
so I had a lot of questions.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.236
GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.836
(Cheers)

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.060
SW: Yeah.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.356
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.596
SW: Thank you.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.836
(Applause)

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.236
GK: While pregnant!

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.596
SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.756
GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.836
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.796
You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.436
they get sick and they get tired.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.116
GK: Have you had morning sickness?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.916
SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.036
But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.996
and I had to really take all that energy,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.036
put it in a paper bag, so to say,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.276
and throw it away,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.436
because I really felt
like I didn't have time

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.556
to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.996
because pregnant or not, no one knew,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.996
and I was supposed to win that tournament

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.956
as I am every tournament that I show up.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.196
I am expected to win,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.636
and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.996
GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.076
SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.996
and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.236
and kind of just bottle them up

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.396
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.996
GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.956
Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.436
I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.956
They said, "Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant."

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.156
But then you always have
these cranky Yankees.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.236
On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.436
who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.716
You have responded to him.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.796
I'm not even going
to dignify what he said,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.716
but you responded. Why did you respond?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.396
SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.156
and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.996
and the people that I've worked with.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.756
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.316
and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.356
and it's something that these young women,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.716
they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.075
and for me, it's just like,

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.236
I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.476
So not only --

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.716
(Applause)

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.916
Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.636
I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.036
and to stand up for myself.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.756
And at that point it was
really important for me to say,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.636
like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.236
but this is inappropriate,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.716
and there's time and there's
a place for everything.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.916
And that really
wasn't the time and the place.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.836
GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.356
because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.596
And your coach said
age is always important,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.516
but in tennis it's very important,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.636
but he has no doubt
that you're coming back.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.356
Have you thought, am I coming back?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.236
Will I take some time off?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.196
I know the women on the tour are saying,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.396
"How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.636
What are you thinking?

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.276
SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.636
so for me everything is really mental.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.076
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.956
I'm really inspired by my sister.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.636
She's a year older than me,
and that's something that --

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.676
if she's still playing, I know I can play.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.276
(Laughter)

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.636
And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.756
and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.556
So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.756
and I know that
it's something I want to do.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.956
And my story is definitely not over yet.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.876
I was talking to my coach about it,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.196
and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.236
and my baby's going to be in the stands

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.156
and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.956
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.756
that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.916
to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.356
A lot of people feel that.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.596
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.276
You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time:

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.516
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.396
And when I saw you last year,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.700
I was saying, "How's
your love life? Da da da."

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.396
You said, "I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.956
You won't know who he is."

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.236
I said, "What's his name?"

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.436
SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.476
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian."
I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.596
But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.876
and you said, you neither.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.396
SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.156
but it's been the best thing for me.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.116
GK: The best thing why?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.756
Does that look like a nerdy geek?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.996
Look at the shirt.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.036
(Laughter)

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.316
No, he's a very nice guy.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.196
SW: You can tell he's into technology.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.956
GK: He's a very, very nice guy.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.556
I like him very much.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.836
So how did he succeed
when others have failed?

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.756
How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me?

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.036
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.316
but ...

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.556
(Laughter)

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.866
GK: Say it, Serena, say it!

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.716
SW: Well ...

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.140
(Laughter)

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.796
Yes.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.876
(Applause)

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.316
GK: But you know what I mean.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.116
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.716
and when she said that to me,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.436
I was like, you know, he really is,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.796
and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.076
GK: Like?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.316
SW: Something simple.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.196
My fashion company,
we have a show every year,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.196
so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.036
because I do everything for the show,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.716
and everything for it,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.436
so I was running around like crazy,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.836
and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.436
and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.796
and it was -- it's a weird story.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.796
It was better in person, I promise.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.796
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.956
Or was it a Beyoncé song?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.556
"If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it"?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.533
Were you feeling pressure to get married?

00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:03.876
Did you know it was coming?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.556
SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.836
and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.996
I really love my life.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.556
I love my freedom.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.116
I heard that kind of changes.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.196
But I love everything that I do,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.516
and I love my career,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.796
and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.636
I've actually been so career-oriented

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.156
and in fact, when he proposed,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.516
I was almost angry.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.836
Not almost. I was angry,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.716
because it was right
in the middle of my training season,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.876
and I said, "I gotta win
the Australian Open.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.476
I can't fly to Rome."

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.316
Because he wanted to take me to Rome,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.036
and I said, "I can't. I gotta win."

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.476
But that's how focused I was.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.396
GK: This is a girl that says,
"No, I can't go to Rome." OK.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.156
SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.676
and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.556
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.236
and that really meant a lot to me,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.036
and when I put my mind to something,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.916
I really am determined to reach it

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.596
no matter what.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.476
GK: You know, you said that for you --

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.956
I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.196
SW: It is.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.436
GK: What do you mean?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.196
SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.916
I feel like once you experience it,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.196
you always want to get that feeling again,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.716
and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.436
but I never forgot that feeling,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.036
and I feel like every time I win one,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.716
I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.196
There's really no feeling
in the world like that.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.196
And it's like, all these years of training

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.276
and being a little kid and playing,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.756
and then winning
is a wonderful experience.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.236
So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.636
and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like --

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.756
GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.076
SW: I'm not the best loser.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.236
GK: That you're very, very, very bad.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.516
Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.756
I get that.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.636
But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.916
(Laughter)

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.676
SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.836
(Laughter)

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.476
(Applause)

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.596
GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.436
because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.116
knows that you two are very close,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.596
and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.716
but I often wonder,
when you're playing her,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.476
do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.516
or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.956
Is it harder for you
playing her or easier?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.196
SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.556
because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.196
And it was something
that has been difficult,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.916
because she's my toughest opponent.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.676
She's tall, she's fast,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.796
she hits hard like me, she serves like me.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.396
It's really like playing a wall.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.636
GK: She knows you.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.356
SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.796
so it's something that is not very easy,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.556
but it's really about,
when I go out there,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.556
I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.796
"You know what?

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.596
I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.036
I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.076
today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.276
and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.556
anywhere on this world."

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.436
GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.556
Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.796
SW: Yes.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.356
GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.076
Do you feel guilt about that?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.756
Do you feel joy in that?

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.596
Is that a difficult position for you?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.316
SW: I don't feel anything in there.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.796
In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.916
She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.156
she's my soul mate.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.380
I mean --

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.036
There's pictures of her pushing me,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.956
really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.356
of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court,

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.916
and she always took care of me.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.464
I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff,

00:11:55.488 --> 00:11:59.796
and she would take her money
and give it to me at school

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.756
and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.076
and that's the kind of person
she actually is

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.556
since I've always known her.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.876
So we always have this incredible
respect for each other

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.156
and this incredible love,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.476
and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.756
but you can still have
a wonderful relationship.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.476
On the court we are mortal enemies,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.316
but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.956
And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.196
but for Venus --

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.236
(Laughter)

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.116
GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.556
and say, "That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah"?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.316
You never have any moment like that?

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.516
SW: I feel like she should have
those moments,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.636
because she's never done
anything bad to me,

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.796
but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.516
GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.876
I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.260
SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.356
GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.636
SW: Yes. GK: I know that.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.876
SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.436
and we are incredibly close.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.676
Not only her.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.796
I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.676
GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.836
and say, look, we're going
to go out there and -- there's nothing?

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.196
SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.956
we were in the locker room together,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.516
and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.836
I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.116
but she was so mad at me.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.916
She's like, "Serena, stop!"
And I was just laughing at her.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.996
But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.596
the second we step on the court,

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.796
it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.036
but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just --

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.316
It is what it is,
because at the end of the day,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.676
she'll always be my sister.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.516
I'm not going to play Australia in --

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.596
Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.156
but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say?

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.676
Let's be safe and say 50 years.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.636
GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.676
When you think about it,
never been anybody

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.516
who has intersected
gender and race the way you have,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.356
the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.636
And when you were growing up,
did you say, "I want to be like that"?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.660
Because now little girls
are looking at you

00:14:13.684 --> 00:14:15.276
saying, "I want to be like that."

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.436
Who was the "I want
to be like that" for you?

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.356
SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.996
For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.356
and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.196
So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.596
I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.596
and I would even see Pete Sampras,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.076
and I would see what they did,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.196
and I noticed that Steffi and Monica

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.636
didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.396
and they kind of were on their own,

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.836
and they were just so focused

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.956
and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did,

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.556
and I was like, "I want to do that."

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.796
So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.396
and if you want to be the best,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.956
you have to hang around people

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.316
and you have to look at people
that are the best,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.236
because you're not going to be the best

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.956
if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.036
GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.516
SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.036
SW: People say, "Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic."

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.436
Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.916
I grew up when I got older,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.396
and I had to work really hard,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.676
and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.876
is because I was
really, really, really small.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.596
GK: Yeah.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.916
You are no longer small.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.076
SW: No, I'm fully grown now.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.956
But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.276
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.196
GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.756
Your body brings men
and women to their knees.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.756
And I mean in a good way.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.516
A lot has been made about your body.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:47.956
It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.996
there's never been anything like it.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.716
Did you have body issues
when you were growing up?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.996
Have you always been
comfortable with your body?

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.756
SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.596
growing up in the public eye,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.756
it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.596
and as any female that's a teenager,

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.836
I definitely was not
comfortable in my body.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.196
I didn't like it.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.036
I didn't understand why I had muscles.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.516
And I stopped lifting weights.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.356
I was like, I'm not going to do this.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.996
But then after I won the US Open,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.276
I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.996
and I wanted to be happy with it,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.396
and I was so appreciative of it.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.636
I'm always healthy.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.476
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.436
and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.596
but I want other people
and other young girls

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.316
that have experienced
what I've experienced

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.716
to be happy with themselves.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.996
So whatever people say --

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.436
masculine, whatever,
too much, too little --

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.836
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.540
(Applause)

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.436
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.156
but what have you learned from losing?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.676
SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.796
The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.196
and some of them are extremely painful,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.236
but I wouldn't take any of them away,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.476
because every time I lose,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.756
it takes a really long time
for me to lose again

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.636
because I learn so much from it.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.076
And I encourage everyone that I talk to --

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.756
I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens --

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.636
not in sports --
in business or in school --

00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:19.275
learn from it.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.396
Don't live in the past,
live in the present,

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:23.636
and don't make the same
mistakes in the future.

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:25.836
That's something
that I always try to live by.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.476
GK: Now you're planning a wedding

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.716
and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.116
in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida?

00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:34.836
What are you thinking?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.876
Big or small?

00:17:36.899 --> 00:17:39.755
SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.036
but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.716
So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking --

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.796
My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.236
I'm not too serious.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.036
GK: And you like to dance.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.156
And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.156
SW: Oh, next for me.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.116
Obviously I'm going to have a baby

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.116
and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.876
and keep working on my fashion line.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.156
That'll be really fun.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.036
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.756
SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.796
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.156
GK: Gayle is a unisex name.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.796
Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on!

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.876
SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.876
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.156
Thank you guys.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.460
(Applause)
