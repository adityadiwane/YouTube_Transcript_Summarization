00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.395
So I want to talk today
about money and happiness,

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.977
which are two things a lot of us
spend a lot of our time thinking about,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.831
either trying to earn them
or trying to increase them.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.134
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:30.967
we see it in religions
and self-help books:

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.286
money can't buy happiness.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.085
And I want to suggest today
that, in fact, that's wrong.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.160
(Laughter)

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:39.401
I'm at a business school,
so that's what we do.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:40.578
So that's wrong,

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.825
and in fact, if you think that,
you're just not spending it right.

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:46.497
So instead of spending it
the way you usually spend it,

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:50.008
maybe if you spent it differently,
that might work a little bit better.

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:53.477
Before I tell you the ways you can spend
it that will make you happier,

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.684
let's think about the ways
we usually spend it

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.520
that don't, in fact, make us happier.

00:00:57.544 --> 00:00:59.280
We had a little natural experiment.

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:02.087
So CNN, a little while ago,
wrote this interesting article

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.603
on what happens to people
when they win the lottery.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:07.065
It turns out people think
when they win the lottery

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:08.446
their lives will be amazing.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.780
This article's about
how their lives get ruined.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.725
What happens when people win the lottery

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.147
is, one, they spend
all the money and go into debt;

00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:18.239
and two, all of their friends
and everyone they've ever met

00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:20.008
find them and bug them for money.

00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:22.204
It ruins their social
relationships, in fact.

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:24.312
So they have more debt
and worse friendships

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.363
than they had before they won the lottery.

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:28.407
What was interesting
about the article was,

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.423
people started commenting
on the article, readers of the thing.

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:33.959
And instead of talking
about how it made them realize

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:35.781
that money doesn't lead to happiness,

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:39.249
everyone started saying, "You know
what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"

00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:41.072
and fantasizing about what they'd do.

00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:44.466
Here's just two of the ones we saw
that are interesting to think about.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.826
One person wrote, "When I win,
I'm going to buy my own little mountain

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.418
and have a little house on top."

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.757
(Laughter)

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.830
And another person wrote,
"I would fill a big bathtub with money

00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:56.094
and get in the tub
while smoking a big fat cigar

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:57.964
and sipping a glass of champagne."

00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:00.548
This is even worse:
"... then I'd have a picture taken

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:01.916
and dozens of glossies made.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.436
Anyone begging for money
or trying to extort from me

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.211
would receive a copy
of the picture and nothing else."

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:09.680
(Laughter)

00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:12.277
And so many of the comments
were exactly of this type,

00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.569
where people got money
and, in fact, it made them antisocial.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.781
So I told you it ruins people's lives
and their friends bug them.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.997
Also, money often makes
us feel very selfish

00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.836
and we do things only for ourselves.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.476
We thought maybe the reason money
doesn't make us happy

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.672
is that we're spending it
on the wrong things;

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.222
in particular, we're always
spending it on ourselves.

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:31.833
And we wondered what would happen

00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:34.397
if we made people spend
more of their money on others.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.644
So instead of being antisocial
with your money,

00:02:36.668 --> 00:02:38.671
what if you were more pro-social with it?

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:41.539
We thought, let's make people
do it and see what happens.

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:43.765
Let's have some people
do what they usually do,

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.067
spend money on themselves,

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.122
and let's make some people
give money away,

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.260
and measure their happiness
and see if, in fact, they get happier.

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:52.837
The first way we did this was,
one Vancouver morning,

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.836
we went out on the campus
at University of British Columbia,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.924
approached people and said,
"Do you want to be in an experiment?"

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:00.116
They said, "Yes."

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.241
We asked them how happy they were,
and then gave them an envelope.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.579
One of the envelopes
had things in it that said,

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.598
"By 5pm today,
spend this money on yourself."

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.195
We gave some examples
of what you could spend it on.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.284
Other people got
a slip of paper that said,

00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:16.423
"By 5pm today, spend this money
on somebody else."

00:03:16.447 --> 00:03:18.637
Also inside the envelope was money.

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.872
And we manipulated
how much money we gave them;

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:23.523
some people got this slip
of paper and five dollars,

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:26.159
some got this slip
of paper and 20 dollars.

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:29.190
We let them go about their day
and do whatever they wanted.

00:03:29.214 --> 00:03:32.191
We found out they did spend it
in the way we asked them to.

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:35.132
We called them up and asked them,
"What did you spend it on?

00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:36.472
How happy do you feel now?"

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:37.747
What did they spend it on?

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:39.168
These are college undergrads;

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.307
a lot of what they spent it on
for themselves

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:43.127
were things like earrings and makeup.

00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:45.830
One woman said she bought
a stuffed animal for her niece.

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:47.633
People gave money to homeless people.

00:03:47.657 --> 00:03:49.700
Huge effect here of Starbucks.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:51.448
(Laughter)

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:53.488
So if you give
undergraduates five dollars,

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:54.910
it looks like coffee to them,

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.982
and they run over to Starbucks
and spend it as fast as they can.

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:01.316
Some people bought coffee for themselves,
the way they usually would,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.459
but others bought coffee
for somebody else.

00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:05.159
So the very same purchase,

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:08.497
just targeted toward yourself
or targeted toward somebody else.

00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:11.084
What did we find when we called
at the end of the day?

00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:13.243
People who spent money
on others got happier;

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:15.757
people who spent it on themselves,
nothing happened.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.809
It didn't make them less happy,
it just didn't do much for them.

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.936
The other thing we saw is the amount
of money doesn't matter much.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.605
People thought 20 dollars
would be way better than five.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.086
In fact, it doesn't matter
how much money you spent.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.806
What really matters
is that you spent it on somebody else

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.001
rather than on yourself.

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:32.331
We see this again and again

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.713
when we give people money to spend
on others instead of on themselves.

00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:38.003
Of course, these are
undergraduates in Canada --

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.242
not the world's most
representative population.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:43.420
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent
and other sorts of things.

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:46.210
We wanted to see if this holds true
everywhere in the world

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:47.779
or just among wealthy countries.

00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:50.609
So we went to Uganda
and ran a very similar experiment.

00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:52.986
Imagine, instead of just people
in Canada, we say,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.768
"Name the last time you spent
money on yourself or others.

00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:57.709
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"

00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:01.151
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time
you spent money on yourself or others

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.332
and describe that."

00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:04.517
Then we asked them
how happy they are, again.

00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.221
And what we see is sort of amazing,

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:09.290
because there's human universals
on what you do with your money,

00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:11.801
and real cultural differences
on what you do as well.

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:15.129
So for example, one guy
from Uganda says this:

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:17.029
"I called a girl I wished to love."

00:05:17.053 --> 00:05:18.836
They basically went out on a date,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.112
and he says at the end
that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.300
(Laughter)

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:25.295
Here's a guy from Canada.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.026
Very similar thing.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.041
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:30.906
We went to a movie, we left early,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.729
and then went back to her room
for ... cake," just cake.

00:05:34.753 --> 00:05:36.107
(Laughter)

00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:37.284
Human universal:

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:39.544
you spend money on others,
you're being nice.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:41.633
Maybe you have something
in mind, maybe not.

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.709
But then we see extraordinary differences.

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:44.886
So look at these two.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.264
This is a woman from Canada.

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.864
We say, "Name a time you spent
money on somebody else."

00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:50.865
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.615
I drove to the mall, bought
a present, gave it to my mom."

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.942
Perfectly nice thing to do.

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:57.021
It's good to get gifts
for people you know.

00:05:57.045 --> 00:05:59.377
Compare that to this woman from Uganda:

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:03.095
"I was walking and met a longtime friend
whose son was sick with malaria.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.493
They had no money, they went to a clinic
and I gave her this money."

00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:08.726
This isn't $10,000,
it's the local currency.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.942
So it's a very small
amount of money, in fact.

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.075
But enormously different motivations here.

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.627
This is a real medical need,
literally a lifesaving donation.

00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.399
Above, it's just kind of,
I bought a gift for my mother.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:21.034
What we see again, though,

00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:24.708
is that the specific way you spend
on other people isn't nearly as important

00:06:24.732 --> 00:06:28.682
as the fact that you spend on other people
in order to make yourself happy,

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.265
which is really quite important.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.830
So you don't have to do
amazing things with your money

00:06:32.854 --> 00:06:34.005
to make yourself happy.

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:37.632
You can do small, trivial things and still
get the benefits from doing this.

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:39.065
These are only two countries.

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.038
We wanted to look at every country
in the world if we could,

00:06:42.062 --> 00:06:44.961
to see what the relationship is
between money and happiness.

00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:46.969
We got data from the Gallup Organization,

00:06:46.993 --> 00:06:49.868
which you know from
all the political polls happening lately.

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.825
They asked people, "Did you donate
money to charity recently?"

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.022
and, "How happy are you
with life in general?"

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:57.923
We can see what the relationship is
between those two things.

00:06:57.947 --> 00:07:00.859
Are they positively correlated,
giving money makes you happy?

00:07:00.883 --> 00:07:02.523
Or are they negatively correlated?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:05.342
On this map, green will mean
they're positively correlated,

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.286
red means they're negatively correlated.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.407
And you can see,
the world is crazily green.

00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:12.694
So in almost every country in the world
where we have this data,

00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:15.175
people who give money
to charity are happier people

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.329
than people who don't give
money to charity.

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:19.967
I know you're looking
at the red country in the middle.

00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.145
I would be a jerk and not
tell you what it is,

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.804
but it's Central African Republic.

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:24.980
You can make up stories.

00:07:25.004 --> 00:07:27.016
Maybe it's different there
for some reason.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.254
Just below that to the right
is Rwanda, though,

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:30.492
which is amazingly green.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.902
So almost everywhere we look,

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:34.359
we see that giving money away
makes you happier

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:35.929
than keeping it for yourself.

00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:38.918
What about work, which is where
we spend the rest of our time,

00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:40.804
when we're not with the people we know.

00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:44.051
We decided to infiltrate some companies
and do a very similar thing.

00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:45.880
These are sales teams in Belgium.

00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:48.953
They work in teams,
go out and sell to doctors

00:07:48.977 --> 00:07:50.553
and try to get them to buy drugs.

00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:52.723
We can look and see
how well they sell things

00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:54.990
as a function of being a member of a team.

00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:57.620
We give people on some teams some money

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.608
"Spend it however you want on yourself,"

00:07:59.632 --> 00:08:01.882
just like we did
with the undergrads in Canada.

00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:05.576
To other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.
Spend it on one of your teammates.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.264
Buy them something as a gift
and give it to them.

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:10.988
Then we can see, we've got teams
that spend on themselves

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:14.783
and these pro-social teams
who we give money to make the team better.

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:16.836
The reason I have
a ridiculous pinata there

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.275
is one team pooled their money
and bought a pinata,

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:22.380
they smashed the pinata,
the candy fell out and things like that.

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:23.844
A silly, trivial thing to do,

00:08:23.868 --> 00:08:27.173
but think of the difference on a team
that didn't do that at all,

00:08:27.197 --> 00:08:30.771
that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,
maybe bought themselves a coffee,

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:32.855
or teams that had
this pro-social experience

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:36.170
where they bonded together
to buy something and do a group activity.

00:08:36.194 --> 00:08:39.263
What we see is that the teams
that are pro-social sell more stuff

00:08:39.287 --> 00:08:41.682
than the teams that only got
money for themselves.

00:08:41.706 --> 00:08:45.349
One way to think of it is: for every
15 euro you give people for themselves,

00:08:45.373 --> 00:08:48.781
they put it in their pocket and don't do
anything different than before.

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:50.246
You don't get money from that;

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.349
you lose money, since it doesn't
motivate them to perform better.

00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:56.175
But when you give them 15 euro
to spend on their teammates,

00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:57.973
they do so much better on their teams

00:08:57.997 --> 00:09:01.091
that you actually get a huge win
on investing this kind of money.

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:03.797
You're probably thinking
to yourselves, this is all fine,

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:07.024
but there's a context that's incredibly
important for public policy,

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:08.962
and I can't imagine it would work there.

00:09:08.986 --> 00:09:11.093
And if he doesn't show me
that it works here,

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.731
I don't believe anything he said.

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:15.542
I know what you're all thinking
about are dodgeball teams.

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:16.957
(Laughter)

00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:18.836
This was a huge criticism that we got,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.041
that if you can't show it
with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.

00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:26.248
So we went and found these dodgeball
teams and infiltrated them,

00:09:26.272 --> 00:09:28.150
and did the exact same thing as before.

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.094
So we give people on some teams
money to spend on themselves.

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:34.836
Other teams, we give them money
to spend on their dodgeball teammates.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.836
The teams that spend money on themselves

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.046
have the same winning
percentages as before.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.489
The teams we give the money
to spend on each other

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.668
become different teams;

00:09:42.692 --> 00:09:45.243
they dominate the league
by the time they're done.

00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:47.276
Across all of these different contexts --

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.908
your personal life, you work life,
even things like intramural sports --

00:09:50.932 --> 00:09:53.742
we see spending on other people
has a bigger return for you

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:55.740
than spending on yourself.

00:09:55.764 --> 00:09:59.565
So if you think money can't buy happiness,
you're not spending it right.

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:03.169
The implication isn't you should buy
this product instead of that product,

00:10:03.193 --> 00:10:05.323
and that's the way
to make yourself happier.

00:10:05.347 --> 00:10:08.982
It's that you should stop thinking
about which product to buy for yourself,

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:11.836
and try giving some of it
to other people instead.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.364
And we luckily have
an opportunity for you.

00:10:14.388 --> 00:10:18.458
DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit
for mainly public school teachers

00:10:18.482 --> 00:10:19.915
in low-income schools.

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:21.232
They post projects like,

00:10:21.256 --> 00:10:24.276
"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn
and we don't have the books,"

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.786
or, "I want a microscope
to teach my students science

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.339
and we don't have a microscope."

00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:30.314
You and I can go on and buy it for them.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.813
The teacher and the kids
write you thank-you notes,

00:10:32.837 --> 00:10:35.650
sometimes they send pictures
of them using the microscope.

00:10:35.674 --> 00:10:37.020
It's an extraordinary thing.

00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:40.160
Go to the website and start yourself
on the process of thinking

00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:42.288
less about "How can I spend
money on myself?"

00:10:42.312 --> 00:10:45.169
and more about "If I've got
five dollars or 15 dollars,

00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:47.338
what can I do to benefit other people?"

00:10:47.362 --> 00:10:50.848
Ultimately, when you do that, you'll find
you benefit yourself much more.

00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:52.063
Thank you.

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:53.490
(Applause)
