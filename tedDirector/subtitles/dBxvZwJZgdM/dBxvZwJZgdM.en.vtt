00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
When I was 10 years old,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And as a special treat,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
he took me to the pathology lab

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and took a real human brain

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
out of the jar

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and placed it in my hands.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And there it was,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
the seat of human consciousness,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
the powerhouse of the human body,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
sitting in my hands.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And that day I knew that when I grew up,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I was going to become a brain doctor,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
scientist, something or the other.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Years later, when I finally grew up,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
my dream came true.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
on the neurological causes

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
of dyslexia in children

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that I encountered a startling fact

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
that I'd like to share with you all today.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
It is estimated that one in six children,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
that's one in six children,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
suffer from some developmental disorder.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
This is a disorder that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
retards mental development in the child

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and causes permanent mental impairments.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Which means that each and every one of you here today

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
knows at least one child that is suffering

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
from a developmental disorder.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
But here's what really perplexed me.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Despite the fact that each

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and every one of these disorders

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
originates in the brain,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
most of these disorders

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
are diagnosed solely on the basis

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
of observable behavior.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But diagnosing a brain disorder

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
without actually looking at the brain

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
based on their physical symptoms,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to look at the heart.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
It seemed so intuitive to me.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Looking at behavior alone

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
can miss a vital piece of the puzzle

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
picture of the child's problems.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
the diagnosis of brain disorders

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
in one in six children

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
still remained so limited.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And then I came across a team at Harvard University

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that had taken one such advanced medical technology

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and finally applied it,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
instead of in brain research,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Their groundbreaking technology

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
records the EEG, or the electrical activity

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of the brain, in real time,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
allowing us to watch the brain

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
as it performs various functions

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and then detect even the slightest abnormality

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
in any of these functions:

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
vision, attention, language, audition.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
A program called Brain Electrical

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Activity Mapping

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
then triangulates the source

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
of that abnormality in the brain.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And another program called

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Statistical Probability Mapping

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
then performs mathematical calculations

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
to determine whether any of these abnormalities

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
are clinically significant,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
allowing us to provide a much more accurate

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
neurological diagnosis

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
of the child's symptoms.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And so I became the head of neurophysiology

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
for the clinical arm of this team,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and we're finally able to use this technology

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
towards actually helping

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
children with brain disorders.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
of setting up this technology here in India.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I'd like to tell you about one such child,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
whose story was also covered by ABC News.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
came to our clinic with this diagnosis

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
of very severe autism.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Like many autistic children,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
his mind was locked inside his body.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
There were moments when he would

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
actually space out for seconds at a time.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And the doctors told his parents

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
he was never going to be able

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to communicate or interact socially,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and he would probably never have too much language.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
to actually look at Justin's brain,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
the results were startling.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It turned out that Justin was almost

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
certainly not autistic.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
He was suffering from brain seizures

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
that were impossible to see with the naked eye,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
but that were actually causing symptoms

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
that mimicked those of autism.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
the change in him was amazing.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Within a period of 60 days,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
his vocabulary went from two to three words

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to 300 words.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And his communication and social interaction

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
were improved so dramatically

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that he was enrolled into a regular school

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and even became a karate super champ.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Research shows that 50 percent of children,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
almost 50 percent of children

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
diagnosed with autism

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
These are the faces of the children

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
that I have tested

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
with stories just like Justin.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
All these children

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
came to our clinic with a diagnosis

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
of autism, attention deficit disorder,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
mental retardation, language problems.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Instead, our EEG scans revealed

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
very specific problems hidden within their brains

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that couldn't possibly have been detected

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
by their behavioral assessments.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So these EEG scans

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
enabled us to provide these children

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and much more targeted treatment.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
For too long now, children with developmental disorders

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
have suffered from misdiagnosis

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
while their real problems have gone undetected

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and left to worsen.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And for too long, these children and their parents

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
have suffered undue frustration and desperation.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
one in which we can finally look

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
directly at brain function in real time

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and find the true source

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
of so many disabilities in children.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So if I could inspire

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
even a fraction of you in the audience today

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
to share this pioneering diagnostic approach

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
with even one parent whose child

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
is suffering from a developmental disorder,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
then perhaps one more puzzle

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
in one more brain will be solved.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
One more mind will be unlocked.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
or even undiagnosed by the system

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
will finally realize his or her true potential

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
while there's still time

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
for his or her brain to recover.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Thank you.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
(Applause)
