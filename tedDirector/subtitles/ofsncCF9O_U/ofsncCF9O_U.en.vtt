00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.619
To be honest, by personality,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.236
I'm just not much of a crier.

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:22.596
But I think in my career
that's been a good thing.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:24.630
I'm a civil rights lawyer,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.634
and I've seen some 
horrible things in the world.

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:32.844
I began my career working 
police abuse cases in the United States.

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.318
And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:41.248
to be the director of the U.N.'s 
genocide investigation.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.647
It turns out that tears 
just aren't much help

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:49.176
when you're trying 
to investigate a genocide.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:54.037
The things I had to see, 
and feel and touch

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.864
were pretty unspeakable.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:00.891
What I can tell you is this:

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:02.988
that the Rwandan genocide

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:08.661
was one of the world's
greatest failures of simple compassion.

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:13.120
That word, compassion, actually 
comes from two Latin words:

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.642
cum passio, which simply mean 
"to suffer with."

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:22.204
And the things that I saw and experienced

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:24.790
in Rwanda as I got up close
to human suffering,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.129
it did, in moments, move me to tears.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.855
But I just wish that I, 
and the rest of the world,

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.370
had been moved earlier.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.034
And not just to tears,

00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:38.834
but to actually stop the genocide.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.292
Now by contrast, I've also been involved

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:47.125
with one of the world's greatest
successes of compassion.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.071
And that's the fight against 
global poverty.

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:52.854
It's a cause that probably
has involved all of us here.

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.852
I don't know if your first introduction

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:58.217
might have been choruses of
"We Are the World,"

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:02.280
or maybe the picture of a sponsored child
on your refrigerator door,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.367
or maybe the birthday you
donated for fresh water.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.581
I don't really remember what my first
introduction to poverty was

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:13.145
but I do remember the most jarring.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:15.307
It was when I met Venus --

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:18.029
she's a mom from Zambia.

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.655
She's got three kids and she's a widow.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:25.022
When I met her, she had walked
about 12 miles

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.695
in the only garments she owned,

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:31.957
to come to the capital city
and to share her story.

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:35.572
She sat down with me for hours,

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:40.097
just ushered me in to 
the world of poverty.

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:43.238
She described what it was like 
when the coals on the cooking fire

00:02:43.238 --> 00:02:46.967
finally just went completely cold.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:51.729
When that last drop 
of cooking oil finally ran out.

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.585
When the last of the food, 
despite her best efforts,

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:56.693
ran out.

00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:01.096
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:03.878
suffer from malnutrition,

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:07.954
as his legs just slowly bowed 
into uselessness.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:11.302
As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:15.480
And then as Peter finally grew cold.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.811
For over 50 years, stories like this
have been moving us to compassion.

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:26.661
We whose kids have plenty to eat.

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:29.330
And we're moved not only 
to care about global poverty,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.020
but to actually try to do our part 
to stop the suffering.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.493
Now there's plenty of room for critique 
that we haven't done enough,

00:03:37.493 --> 00:03:41.715
and what it is that we've done
hasn't been effective enough,

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:44.845
but the truth is this:

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:48.396
The fight against global poverty
is probably the broadest,

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:53.531
longest running manifestation of the 
human phenomenon of compassion

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:56.673
in the history of our species.

00:03:56.673 --> 00:04:00.322
And so I'd like to share
a pretty shattering insight

00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:04.615
that might forever change the way
you think about that struggle.

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.438
But first, let me begin with what
you probably already know.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.920
Thirty-five years ago, when I would have
been graduating from high school,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.297
they told us that 40,000 kids every day
died because of poverty.

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:21.669
That number, today, is now 
down to 17,000.

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.675
Way too many, of course,

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.352
but it does mean that every year,

00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:30.900
there's eight million kids who
don't have to die from poverty.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.067
Moreover, the number of 
people in our world

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.230
who are living in extreme poverty,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.567
which is defined as living off
about a dollar and a quarter a day,

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:43.179
that has fallen from 50 percent,

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:46.413
to only 15 percent.

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:48.853
This is massive progress,

00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:53.678
and this exceeds everybody's 
expectations about what is possible.

00:04:54.258 --> 00:04:57.123
And I think you and I,

00:04:57.123 --> 00:05:01.399
I think, honestly, that we can 
feel proud and encouraged

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:05.284
to see the way that compassion 
actually has the power

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:10.476
to succeed in stopping 
the suffering of millions.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:14.852
But here's the part that you 
might not hear very much about.

00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:19.586
If you move that poverty mark just
up to two dollars a day,

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:22.585
it turns out that virtually 
the same two billion people

00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:26.397
who were stuck in that harsh poverty
when I was in high school,

00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:28.278
are still stuck there,

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:30.667
35 years later.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:35.686
So why, why are so many billions
still stuck in such harsh poverty?

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:39.351
Well, let's think about
Venus for a moment.

00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:43.123
Now for decades, my wife and I have been
moved by common compassion

00:05:43.123 --> 00:05:45.952
to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:49.471
to support generous levels of foreign aid.

00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:52.563
But until I had actually talked to Venus,

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:55.200
I would have had no idea that 
none of those approaches

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.696
actually addressed why she had
to watch her son die.

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:06.243
"We were doing fine," Venus told me,

00:06:06.243 --> 00:06:10.785
"until Brutus started to cause trouble."

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.755
Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor 
and "cause trouble"

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:17.281
is what happened the day after
Venus' husband died,

00:06:17.281 --> 00:06:21.213
when Brutus just came and threw
Venus and the kids out of the house,

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:24.965
stole all their land, and robbed
their market stall.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:31.342
You see, Venus was thrown 
into destitution by violence.

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:34.891
And then it occurred to me, of course,

00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:38.690
that none of my child sponsorships,
none of the microloans,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.552
none of the traditional 
anti-poverty programs

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:46.518
were going to stop Brutus,

00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:49.872
because they weren't meant to.

00:06:49.872 --> 00:06:54.878
This became even more clear
to me when I met Griselda.

00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:59.097
She's a marvelous young girl
living in a very poor community

00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:00.913
in Guatemala.

00:07:00.913 --> 00:07:03.310
And one of the things
we've learned over the years

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.881
is that perhaps the most powerful thing

00:07:05.881 --> 00:07:08.725
that Griselda and her family can do

00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:11.390
to get Griselda and her family 
out of poverty

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.514
is to make sure that she goes to school.

00:07:14.514 --> 00:07:19.239
The experts call this the Girl Effect.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:23.321
But when we met Griselda, 
she wasn't going to school.

00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.878
In fact, she was rarely ever 
leaving her home.

00:07:28.388 --> 00:07:30.173
Days before we met her,

00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:32.818
while she was walking home
from church with her family,

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:35.133
in broad daylight,

00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:38.610
men from her community 
just snatched her off the street,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.708
and violently raped her.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:46.205
See, Griselda had every
opportunity to go to school,

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:49.626
it just wasn't safe for her to get there.

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:52.466
And Griselda's not the only one.

00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:55.190
Around the world, poor women and girls

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.301
between the ages of 15 and 44,

00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:04.386
they are -- when victims of 
the everyday violence

00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:07.872
of domestic abuse and sexual violence --

00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:12.684
those two forms of violence account
for more death and disability

00:08:12.684 --> 00:08:19.688
than malaria, than car accidents,
than war combined.

00:08:23.298 --> 00:08:28.075
The truth is, the poor of our world
are trapped in whole systems of violence.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:32.108
In South Asia, for instance,
I could drive past this rice mill

00:08:32.108 --> 00:08:35.045
and see this man hoisting 
these 100-pound sacks

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:37.089
of rice upon his thin back.

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:38.907
But I would have no idea, until later,

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:41.349
that he was actually a slave,

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:45.738
held by violence in that rice mill
since I was in high school.

00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:50.239
Decades of anti-poverty programs
right in his community

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:54.321
were never able to rescue him
or any of the hundred other slaves

00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:57.957
from the beatings and the rapes
and the torture

00:08:57.957 --> 00:09:01.652
of violence inside the rice mill.

00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:06.032
In fact, half a century of 
anti-poverty programs

00:09:06.032 --> 00:09:09.706
have left more poor people in slavery

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:13.071
than in any other time in human history.

00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:19.050
Experts tell us that there's about
35 million people in slavery today.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.711
That's about the population 
of the entire nation of Canada,

00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.179
where we're sitting today.

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:29.483
This is why, over time, I have come
to call this epidemic of violence

00:09:29.483 --> 00:09:31.772
the Locust Effect.

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.783
Because in the lives of the poor,
it just descends like a plague

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.571
and it destroys everything.

00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:41.954
In fact, now when you survey
very, very poor communities,

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:46.038
residents will tell you that their
greatest fear is violence.

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.607
But notice the violence that they fear

00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.785
is not the violence of 
genocide or the wars,

00:09:51.785 --> 00:09:54.140
it's everyday violence.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.353
So for me, as a lawyer, of course,
my first reaction was to think,

00:09:57.353 --> 00:09:59.667
well, of course we've
got to change all the laws.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:03.167
We've got to make all this violence
against the poor illegal.

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:06.902
But then I found out, it already is.

00:10:06.902 --> 00:10:09.742
The problem is not that 
the poor don't get laws,

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:13.442
it's that they don't get law enforcement.

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:16.185
In the developing world,

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:19.250
basic law enforcement systems
are so broken

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.416
that recently the U.N. issued 
a report that found

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:28.020
that "most poor people live
outside the protection of the law."

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.412
Now honestly, you and I have 
just about no idea

00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:32.009
of what that would mean

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:35.688
because we have no 
first-hand experience of it.

00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:38.765
Functioning law enforcement for us 
is just a total assumption.

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:43.137
In fact, nothing expresses that assumption
more clearly than three simple numbers:

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:45.598
9-1-1,

00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:48.765
which, of course, is the number
for the emergency police operator

00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:52.066
here in Canada and in the United States,

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:56.147
where the average response time 
to a police 911 emergency call

00:10:56.147 --> 00:10:57.810
is about 10 minutes.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.995
So we take this just 
completely for granted.

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:05.512
But what if there was no 
law enforcement to protect you?

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:11.204
A woman in Oregon recently
experienced what this would be like.

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:15.545
She was home alone in her 
dark house on a Saturday night,

00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:18.510
when a man started to tear 
his way into her home.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.467
This was her worst nightmare,

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:25.075
because this man had actually put her
in the hospital from an assault

00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:27.193
just two weeks before.

00:11:27.193 --> 00:11:30.551
So terrified, she picks up that phone
and does what any of us would do:

00:11:30.551 --> 00:11:33.196
She calls 911 --

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:38.028
but only to learn that because 
of budget cuts in her county,

00:11:38.028 --> 00:11:41.397
law enforcement wasn't available 
on the weekends.

00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:42.187
Listen.

00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:45.006
Dispatcher: I don't have anybody 
to send out there.

00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:46.023
Woman: OK

00:11:46.023 --> 00:11:50.126
Dispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes
inside the residence and assaults you,

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.799
can you ask him to go away?

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.042
Or do you know if
he is intoxicated or anything?

00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:57.415
Woman: I've already asked him.
I've already told him I was calling you.

00:11:57.415 --> 00:12:00.088
He's broken in before,
busted down my door, assaulted me.

00:12:00.088 --> 00:12:01.033
Dispatcher: Uh-huh.

00:12:01.033 --> 00:12:02.186
Woman: Um, yeah, so ...

00:12:02.186 --> 00:12:05.405
Dispatcher: Is there any way you could
safely leave the residence?

00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:08.822
Woman: No, I can't, because he's blocking
pretty much my only way out.

00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:11.968
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do 
is give you some advice,

00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:14.684
and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.

00:12:14.684 --> 00:12:19.496
Obviously, if he comes in and
unfortunately has a weapon

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:22.822
or is trying to cause you physical harm,
that's a different story.

00:12:22.822 --> 00:12:25.489
You know, the sheriff's office
doesn't work up there.

00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:28.145
I don't have anybody to send."

00:12:29.735 --> 00:12:32.388
Gary Haugen: Tragically, the woman 
inside that house

00:12:32.388 --> 00:12:38.327
was violently assaulted, choked and raped

00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:44.371
because this is what it means to live
outside the rule of law.

00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:49.855
And this is where billions
of our poorest live.

00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:54.443
What does that look like?

00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:58.871
In Bolivia, for example, if a man 
sexually assaults a poor child,

00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:03.544
statistically, he's at greater risk
of slipping in the shower and dying

00:13:03.544 --> 00:13:06.942
than he is of ever going 
to jail for that crime.

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:12.687
In South Asia, if you 
enslave a poor person,

00:13:12.687 --> 00:13:15.610
you're at greater risk of being 
struck by lightning

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.660
than ever being sent 
to jail for that crime.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.639
And so the epidemic of everyday 
violence, it just rages on.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:27.738
And it devastates our efforts to try
to help billions of people

00:13:27.738 --> 00:13:31.315
out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.

00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:33.817
Because the data just doesn't lie.

00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:36.876
It turns out that you can give 
all manner of goods and services

00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:38.029
to the poor,

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:41.155
but if you don't restrain the hands 
of the violent bullies

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.990
from taking it all away,

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.349
you're going to be very disappointed
in the long-term impact of your efforts.

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:51.660
So you would think that the disintegration
of basic law enforcement

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.675
in the developing world
would be a huge priority

00:13:54.675 --> 00:13:57.915
for the global fight against poverty.

00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:00.048
But it's not.

00:14:01.028 --> 00:14:04.825
Auditors of international assistance
recently couldn't find

00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:08.659
even one percent of aid going 
to protect the poor

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:12.990
from the lawless chaos 
of everyday violence.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.296
And honestly, when we do talk about 
violence against the poor,

00:14:16.296 --> 00:14:19.805
sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:22.888
A fresh water organization tells
a heart-wrenching story

00:14:22.888 --> 00:14:26.480
of girls who are raped on the way
to fetching water,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.290
and then celebrates
the solution of a new well

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.745
that drastically shortens their walk.

00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.953
End of story.

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:42.353
But not a word about the rapists who
are still right there in the community.

00:14:43.813 --> 00:14:46.127
If a young woman on one 
of our college campuses

00:14:46.127 --> 00:14:49.273
was raped on her walk to the library, 

00:14:49.273 --> 00:14:55.121
we would never celebrate the solution
of moving the library closer to the dorm.

00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:59.112
And yet, for some reason,
this is okay for poor people.

00:15:00.915 --> 00:15:03.469
Now the truth is, the traditional experts

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.775
in economic development
and poverty alleviation,

00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:08.035
they don't know how to fix this problem.

00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:09.856
And so what happens?

00:15:09.856 --> 00:15:11.947
They don't talk about it.

00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:17.408
But the more fundamental reason

00:15:17.408 --> 00:15:20.188
that law enforcement for the poor
in the developing world

00:15:20.188 --> 00:15:22.072
is so neglected,

00:15:22.072 --> 00:15:25.957
is because the people inside
the developing world, with money,

00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:28.075
don't need it.

00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:31.745
I was at the World Economic 
Forum not long ago

00:15:31.745 --> 00:15:35.689
talking to corporate executives who have
massive businesses in the developing world

00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:37.771
and I was just asking them,

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:43.325
"How do you guys protect all your people
and property from all the violence?"

00:15:43.325 --> 00:15:48.147
And they looked at each other, 
and they said, practically in unison,

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.174
"We buy it."

00:15:51.474 --> 00:15:55.336
Indeed, private security forces 
in the developing world

00:15:55.336 --> 00:16:02.146
are now, four, five and seven times
larger than the public police force.

00:16:02.146 --> 00:16:09.608
In Africa, the largest employer 
on the continent now is private security.

00:16:10.884 --> 00:16:14.702
But see, the rich can pay for safety
and can keep getting richer,

00:16:14.702 --> 00:16:18.504
but the poor can't pay for it
and they're left totally unprotected

00:16:18.504 --> 00:16:21.074
and they keep getting thrown
to the ground.

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:26.896
This is a massive and scandalous outrage.

00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:29.849
And it doesn't have to be this way.

00:16:29.849 --> 00:16:32.416
Broken law enforcement can be fixed.

00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:34.496
Violence can be stopped.

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:36.888
Almost all criminal justice systems,

00:16:36.888 --> 00:16:39.417
they start out broken and corrupt,

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:43.687
but they can be transformed
by fierce effort and commitment.

00:16:43.687 --> 00:16:45.930
The path forward is really pretty clear.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.377
Number one: We have to start making

00:16:49.377 --> 00:16:53.144
stopping violence indispensable 
to the fight against poverty.

00:16:53.144 --> 00:16:55.578
In fact, any conversation
about global poverty

00:16:55.578 --> 00:17:00.172
that doesn't include the problem 
of violence must be deemed not serious.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:05.792
And secondly, we have to begin 
to seriously invest resources

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:09.729
and share expertise to support 
the developing world

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:13.086
as they fashion new, 
public systems of justice,

00:17:13.086 --> 00:17:14.652
not private security,

00:17:14.652 --> 00:17:17.299
that give everybody a chance to be safe.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.031
These transformations 
are actually possible

00:17:21.031 --> 00:17:23.640
and they're happening today.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.778
Recently, the Gates Foundation 
funded a project

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:29.254
in the second largest city 
of the Philippines,

00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:32.260
where local advocates
and local law enforcement

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:39.118
were able to transform corrupt police
and broken courts so drastically,

00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:41.705
that in just four short years,

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:44.177
they were able to measurably reduce

00:17:44.177 --> 00:17:49.671
the commercial sexual violence 
against poor kids by 79 percent.

00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:55.302
You know, from the hindsight of history,

00:17:55.302 --> 00:18:00.859
what's always most inexplicable
and inexcusable

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:04.080
are the simple failures of compassion.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.208
Because I think history convenes 
a tribunal of our grandchildren

00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:11.969
and they just ask us,

00:18:11.969 --> 00:18:15.211
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?

00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:19.766
Where were you, Grandpa, when 
the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.695
and were being rejected from our shores?

00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:23.823
Where were you?

00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:26.223
And Grandma, where were you
when they were marching

00:18:26.223 --> 00:18:30.276
our Japanese-American neighbors
off to internment camps?

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.665
And Grandpa, where were you 
when they were beating

00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:34.938
our African-American neighbors

00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:38.458
just because they were trying
to register to vote?"

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:42.702
Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,

00:18:42.702 --> 00:18:45.143
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you

00:18:45.143 --> 00:18:49.636
when two billion of the world's poorest
were drowning in a lawless chaos

00:18:49.636 --> 00:18:52.337
of everyday violence?"

00:18:53.287 --> 00:18:59.852
I hope we can say that we had compassion,
that we raised our voice,

00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:07.684
and as a generation, we were moved
to make the violence stop.

00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:10.141
Thank you very much.

00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:13.830
(Applause)

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.785
Chris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.

00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:31.064
Talk to us a bit about
some of the things

00:19:31.064 --> 00:19:37.588
that have actually been happening to,
for example, boost police training.

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:39.427
How hard a process is that?

00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:43.009
GH: Well, one of the glorious 
things that's starting to happen now

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:47.619
is that the collapse of these systems
and the consequences are becoming obvious.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:50.981
There's actually, now, 
political will to do that.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:55.106
But it just requires now an investment
of resources and transfer of expertise.

00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:58.509
There's a political will struggle 
that's going to take place as well,

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:00.324
but those are winnable fights,

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.623
because we've done some examples
around the world

00:20:02.623 --> 00:20:05.732
at International Justice Mission
that are very encouraging.

00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:09.233
CA: So just tell us in one country,
how much it costs

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:12.748
to make a material difference 
to police, for example --

00:20:12.748 --> 00:20:14.538
I know that's only one piece of it.

00:20:14.538 --> 00:20:17.754
GH: In Guatemala, for instance,
we've started a project there

00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:21.006
with the local police 
and court system, prosecutors,

00:20:21.006 --> 00:20:24.819
to retrain them so that they can 
actually effectively bring these cases.

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:29.131
And we've seen prosecutions against
perpetrators of sexual violence

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:31.967
increase by more than 1,000 percent.

00:20:31.967 --> 00:20:36.356
This project has been very modestly funded
at about a million dollars a year,

00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:38.662
and the kind of bang 
you can get for your buck

00:20:38.662 --> 00:20:42.838
in terms of leveraging
a criminal justice system

00:20:42.838 --> 00:20:47.595
that could function if it were properly
trained and motivated and led,

00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:50.138
and these countries, 
especially a middle class

00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:53.282
that is seeing that there's 
really no future

00:20:53.282 --> 00:20:57.150
with this total instability and
total privatization of security

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.341
I think there's an opportunity,
a window for change.

00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:05.418
CA: But to make this happen, you have
to look at each part in the chain --

00:21:05.421 --> 00:21:07.676
the police, who else?

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:09.957
GH: So that's the thing 
about law enforcement,

00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.400
it starts out with the police,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.083
they're the front end
of the pipeline of justice,

00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:16.030
but they hand if off to the prosecutors,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.265
and the prosecutors 
hand it off to the courts,

00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:21.557
and the survivors of violence 
have to be supported by social services

00:21:21.557 --> 00:21:22.863
all the way through that.

00:21:22.863 --> 00:21:25.675
So you have to do an approach 
that pulls that all together.

00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:28.726
In the past, there's been a little bit
of training of the courts,

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:30.900
but they get crappy evidence 
from the police,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.537
or a little police intervention 
that has to do with narcotics or terrorism

00:21:34.537 --> 00:21:37.405
but nothing to do with treating
the common poor person

00:21:37.405 --> 00:21:38.924
with excellent law enforcement,

00:21:38.924 --> 00:21:40.949
so it's about pulling that all together,

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:44.091
and you can actually have people
in very poor communities

00:21:44.091 --> 00:21:46.274
experience law enforcement like us,

00:21:46.274 --> 00:21:49.096
which is imperfect in our 
own experience, for sure,

00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:52.228
but boy, is it a great thing to sense
that you can call 911

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:55.264
and maybe someone will protect you.

00:21:55.264 --> 00:21:57.537
CA: Gary, I think you've done 
a spectacular job

00:21:57.537 --> 00:21:59.664
of bringing this to the world's attention

00:21:59.664 --> 00:22:01.411
in your book and right here today.

00:22:01.411 --> 00:22:02.505
Thanks so much.

00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:03.281
Gary Haugen.

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.114
