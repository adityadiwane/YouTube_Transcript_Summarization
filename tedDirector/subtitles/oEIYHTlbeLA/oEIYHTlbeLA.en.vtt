00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.356
"Robam kbach boran,"

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.156
or the art of Khmer classical dance,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.980
is more than 1,000 years old.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.396
It was developed as a prayer in movement

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.596
for rain and fertility,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.020
and a prosperity that this meant
for an agricultural society.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.556
Dancers who were both men and women

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.836
were offered to temples

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.940
where they served as living bridges
between heaven and earth.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.556
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers
of the people up to the gods,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.956
and the will of the deities
was delivered back through them

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.500
to the people and the land.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.340
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.780
Our backs are arched,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.476
our knees are bent,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.516
our toes are curled,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.876
our elbows are hyperflexed

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.340
and our fingers are curved backwards.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.076
All of these curves
create a serpentine impression,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.876
and this is important because before
the introduction of major religions,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.660
Khmers, and people all over the world
practiced animism.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.836
Serpents were especially important
in this belief system

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.236
because in their fluid,
curvilinear movement,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.900
they mimicked the flow of water.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.876
So to invoke the serpent
in your dancing body then

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.660
was to conjure the image
of rivers cutting across the earth:

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.460
inspire the flow of life-giving waters.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.556
As you can see then,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.996
Khmer classical dance
is a transformation of nature,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.140
of both the physical world around us
and of our own internal universe.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.076
We have four primary
hand gestures that we use.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.300
Can we do them together?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.820
Yeah? OK.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.780
This is a tree.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020
That tree will grow,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.340
and then it will have leaves.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.956
After it has leaves,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.700
it'll have flowers,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.076
and after it has flowers,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.820
it'll have fruit.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.036
That fruit will drop

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.076
and a new tree will grow.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.156
And in those four gestures

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.780
is the cycle of life.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.356
These four gestures are then used

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.036
to create a whole entire language
with which dancers express themselves.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.356
So for example,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.716
I can say,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.940
"I."

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.020
"I."

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.940
In dance that would be ...

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.116
"I."

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.340
Or I can say ...

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.196
"Hey you, come here, come here."

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.420
In dance ...

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.516
"Come here,"

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.436
or, "Go, go."

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.660
(Laughter)

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.116
"Go."

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.380
And everything from ...

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.300
love ...

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.380
to sadness,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.516
to --

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.556
(Stomping)

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.916
anger

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.180
can be expressed
through the dance as well.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.636
There's a certain magic

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.796
in the way that things are filtered,
transformed and put together

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.460
to create limitless possibilities in art.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.156
The Khmer word for art,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.396
silapak,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.020
in fact, at its root, means "magic."

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.356
The artist --

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.876
the silapakar,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.316
or the silapakarani, then,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.500
is nothing short of a magician.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.116
I am very proud to say

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.156
that I belong to a long line of magicians,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.460
from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.340
to her teachers who were stars
in the royal palace,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.956
to the ancient dancers of Angkor

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.516
and to the primal villagers

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.100
from which the art form
originally took life.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.516
That said,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.300
our cherished heritage was once
almost completely destroyed.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.356
If you are wearing glasses,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.580
please stand up.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.956
If you speak more than one language,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.180
please stand up.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.716
If you have light skin,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.940
please stand up.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.860
Your glasses meant
that you could afford health care.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.260
That second or third language you spoke
indicated your elite education.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.540
Your light skin meant
you didn't have to work beneath the sun.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.396
Under the Khmer Rouge,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.756
who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.956
we would all be dead now,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.860
targeted because of our assumed privilege.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.196
You see,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.356
the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.996
and they saw centuries
of rigid inequality.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.196
The king and the few elites around him

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.076
had all the pleasures
and comforts of the world

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.316
while the mass majority
suffered from backbreaking labor

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.580
and harsh poverty.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.180
You don't need a history book
to see that this is true.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.156
The Khmer word for "I,"

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.380
for "me,"

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.660
is khnhom.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.756
This very same word can also mean "slave"

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.516
and dancers were in fact known
as knhom preah robam,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.140
or "slaves of the sacred dance."

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.076
The Khmer Rouge sought
to end slavery in Cambodia,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.580
yet somehow they turned
everyone into slaves to do it.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.220
They became the oppression
that they sought to end.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.876
They evacuated the capital

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.396
and forced people into labor camps.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.316
They tore families apart

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.100
and brainwashed children
against their own parents.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.156
Everywhere, people were dying
and being killed,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.236
losing their lives from disease,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.476
overwork,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500
execution and starvation.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.156
The result of this is that an entire third
of Cambodia's population was lost

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.996
in less than four years,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.860
and in that number were 90 percent
of Khmer dance artists.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.316
In other words,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.940
nine out of 10 visions
for the tradition and future were lost.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.276
Thankfully, however,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.356
it was my teacher's teachers,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.116
Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.196
who would lead the revival of the art form

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.460
from the ashes of war and genocide:

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.116
one student,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.716
one gesture,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.716
one dance at a time.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.636
They wrote the love,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.116
magic,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.356
beauty,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.716
history and philosophy of our lineage

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.220
into the bodies of the next generation.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.356
Nearly 40 years later,

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.900
Khmer classical dance
has been revived to new heights.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.460
Yet somehow it still exists
in a vulnerable environment.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.636
The disastrous effects of war
still haunt Khmer people today.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.756
It is written in our bodies,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.316
manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.116
and in families facing cyclical poverty

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.860
and immense cultural rifts
and language barriers.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.220
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.756
Beauty has this ability
to grow anywhere and everywhere

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.980
at any time.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.020
Beauty is what connects people
through time and place.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.540
Beauty is a liberation from suffering.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.796
As Khmer artists work to revive
our culture and country,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.060
we find that there are many paths
in which to move forward into the future.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.156
And in a tradition where we often
don't know the dancer's names,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.396
who they were,

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.916
what their lives were like,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.796
what they felt,

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:52.020
let me propose that we move forward
honestly and openly from "khnhom."

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.396
Khnhom not as in slave,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.340
but as in conscious service.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.036
Khnhom:

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.676
"I,"

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.196
"me,"

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.420
"flowering."

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.596
My name is Prumsodun Ok.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.836
I am Khmer,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.836
and I am American.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.196
I am the child of refugees,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.156
a creator, a healer,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.900
and a builder of bridges.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.076
I am my teacher's first male student

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.396
in a tradition understood
by many as female,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.500
and I founded Cambodia's first
gay dance company.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.796
I am the incarnation
of the beauty, dreams and power

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.756
of those who came before me.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.276
The convergence
of past, present and future,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.740
and of individual and collective.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.116
Let me then play
that ancient and ageless role

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.236
of the artist as messenger,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.500
by sharing the words of Chheng Phon

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.636
"A garden with only one type of flower,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.676
or flowers of only one color,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.900
is no good."

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.340
This is a reminder that our strength,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.236
growth,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.476
survival

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.716
and very existence,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.100
lies in diversity.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.756
It is, however,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.580
a message of courage as well.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.700
For a flower does not ask
for anyone's permission to bloom.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.420
It was born to offer itself to the world.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.140
Fearless love is its nature.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.916
Thank you.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:33.300
(Applause)
