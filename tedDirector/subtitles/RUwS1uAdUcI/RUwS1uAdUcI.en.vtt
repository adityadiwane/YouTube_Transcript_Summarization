00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.981
About 10 years ago, I took on the task
to teach global development

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.028
to Swedish undergraduate students.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:34.972
That was after having spent about 20 years

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:38.506
together with African institutions
studying hunger in Africa,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.449
so I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world.

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:45.976
And I started in our medical university,
Karolinska Institute,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.370
an undergraduate course
called Global Health.

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:52.376
But when you get that opportunity,
you get a little nervous.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.275
I thought, these students coming to us

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.811
actually have the highest grade
you can get in Swedish college systems --

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:01.252
so I thought, maybe they know everything
I'm going to teach them about.

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:02.976
So I did a pre-test when they came.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.708
And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one:

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:10.670
"Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs?"

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.610
I put them together,
so that in each pair of country,

00:01:14.634 --> 00:01:18.429
one has twice the child
mortality of the other.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.698
And this means that
it's much bigger a difference

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:24.393
than the uncertainty of the data.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.732
I won't put you at a test here,
but it's Turkey,

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:30.976
which is highest there, Poland,
Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.656
And these were the results
of the Swedish students.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.585
I did it so I got the confidence interval,
which is pretty narrow, and I got happy,

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.400
of course: a 1.8 right answer
out of five possible.

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:43.976
That means that there was a place
for a professor of international health

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.107
and for my course.

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:46.249
(Laughter)

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.976
But one late night,
when I was compiling the report,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.832
I really realized my discovery.

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:55.963
I have shown that Swedish top students

00:01:55.987 --> 00:02:00.976
know statistically significantly less
about the world than the chimpanzees.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230
Because the chimpanzee
would score half right

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:09.113
if I gave them two bananas
with Sri Lanka and Turkey.

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:12.559
They would be right half of the cases.
But the students are not there.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:16.798
The problem for me was not ignorance;
it was preconceived ideas.

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:19.559
I did also an unethical study

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:21.806
of the professors
of the Karolinska Institute,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.191
that hands out
the Nobel Prize in Medicine,

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:26.406
and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.454
(Laughter)

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:33.661
This is where I realized that
there was really a need to communicate,

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.587
because the data
of what's happening in the world

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.782
and the child health
of every country is very well aware.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.726
We did this software
which displays it like this:

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.531
every bubble here is a country.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:49.572
This country over here is China.

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:50.597
This is India.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.885
The size of the bubble is the population,

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.690
and on this axis here,
I put fertility rate.

00:02:56.714 --> 00:02:58.976
Because my students, what they said

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.809
when they looked upon the world,
and I asked them,

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.179
"What do you really
think about the world?"

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:07.745
Well, I first discovered
that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.918
(Laughter)

00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:11.457
And they said, "The world
is still 'we' and 'them.'

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:14.449
And 'we' is Western world
and 'them' is Third World."

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.891
"And what do you mean
with Western world?" I said.

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.892
"Well, that's long life and small family,

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.248
and Third World is short life
and large family."

00:03:23.058 --> 00:03:25.436
So this is what I could display here.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.836
I put fertility rate here:
number of children per woman:

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.976
one, two, three, four,
up to about eight children per woman.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.345
We have very good data
since 1962 -- 1960 about --

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.402
on the size of families in all countries.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.801
The error margin is narrow.

00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:41.672
Here, I put life expectancy at birth,

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:44.976
from 30 years in some countries
up to about 70 years.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.976
And 1962, there was really
a group of countries here

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.253
that was industrialized countries,

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:53.601
and they had small families
and long lives.

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.639
And these were the developing countries:

00:03:55.663 --> 00:03:58.741
they had large families
and they had relatively short lives.

00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:02.644
Now, what has happened since 1962?
We want to see the change.

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:05.605
Are the students right?
Is it still two types of countries?

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.188
Or have these developing countries
got smaller families and they live here?

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:11.687
Or have they got longer lives
and live up there?

00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:13.552
Let's see. We stopped the world then.

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:16.062
This is all U.N. statistics
that have been available.

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.587
Here we go. Can you see there?

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.898
It's China there, moving against
better health there, improving there.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:24.567
All the green Latin American countries
are moving towards smaller families.

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.013
Your yellow ones here
are the Arabic countries,

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:30.938
and they get longer life,
but not larger families.

00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:33.584
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.986
This is India; Indonesia
is moving on pretty fast.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.039
(Laughter)

00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:40.498
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh
still among the African countries.

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:43.475
But now, Bangladesh --
it's a miracle that happens in the '80s:

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.976
the imams start to promote
family planning.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.839
They move up into that corner.

00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:51.064
And in the '90s, we have
the terrible HIV epidemic

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:54.694
that takes down the life expectancy
of the African countries

00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:57.976
and all the rest of them
move up into the corner,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.914
where we have long lives and small family,
and we have a completely new world.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:06.152
(Applause)

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.976
(Applause ends)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.380
Let me make a comparison directly

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:20.331
between the United States
of America and Vietnam.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:21.554
1964.

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:25.149
America had small families and long life;

00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:28.299
Vietnam had large families
and short lives.

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:29.991
And this is what happens:

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:34.976
the data during the war indicate
that even with all the death,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.153
there was an improvement
of life expectancy.

00:05:37.177 --> 00:05:40.141
By the end of the year,
the family planning started in Vietnam;

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:41.732
they went for smaller families.

00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:44.647
And the United States up there
is getting for longer life,

00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:45.778
keeping family size.

00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:48.838
And in the '80s now,
they give up Communist planning

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:50.821
and they go for market economy,

00:05:50.845 --> 00:05:52.846
and it moves faster even than social life.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.151
And today, we have in Vietnam

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:59.846
the same life expectancy
and the same family size

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.945
here in Vietnam, 2003,

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.705
as in United States, 1974,
by the end of the war.

00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:10.809
If we don't look in the data,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:13.976
I think we all underestimate
the tremendous change in Asia,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.769
which was in social change
before we saw the economical change.

00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:22.976
Let's move over to another way here
in which we could display

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.877
the distribution
in the world of the income.

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.368
This is the world distribution
of income of people.

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:34.976
One dollar, 10 dollars
or 100 dollars per day.

00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:39.412
There's no gap between rich
and poor any longer. This is a myth.

00:06:39.436 --> 00:06:41.451
There's a little hump here.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.976
But there are people all the way.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.976
And if we look where the income ends up,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.322
this is 100 percent
the world's annual income.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.809
And the richest 20 percent,

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:58.707
they take out of that about 74 percent.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:03.882
And the poorest 20 percent,
they take about two percent.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.815
And this shows that the concept
of developing countries

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.194
is extremely doubtful.

00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:09.976
We think about aid,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.948
like these people here giving aid
to these people here.

00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:16.610
But in the middle, we have
most of the world population,

00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:19.725
and they have now
24 percent of the income.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:23.519
We heard it in other forms.
And who are these?

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:27.944
Where are the different countries?
I can show you Africa.

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:29.392
This is Africa.

00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:32.786
10% the world population, most in poverty.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.823
This is OECD.

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:37.430
The rich country.
The country club of the U.N.

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:42.870
And they are over here on this side.
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.

00:07:42.894 --> 00:07:44.242
And this is Latin America.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.621
It has everything on this Earth,
from the poorest to the richest

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:48.893
in Latin America.

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.935
And on top of that,
we can put East Europe,

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.348
we can put East Asia,
and we put South Asia.

00:07:55.372 --> 00:07:58.502
And how did it look like
if we go back in time,

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:00.429
to about 1970?

00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:02.975
Then there was more of a hump.

00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:07.562
And we have most who lived
in absolute poverty were Asians.

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:10.778
The problem in the world
was the poverty in Asia.

00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:13.976
And if I now let the world move forward,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.750
you will see that
while population increases,

00:08:16.774 --> 00:08:19.843
there are hundreds of millions
in Asia getting out of poverty

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:22.076
and some others getting into poverty,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.001
and this is the pattern we have today.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.096
And the best projection
from the World Bank

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.854
is that this will happen,

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:29.906
and we will not have a divided world.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.825
We'll have most people in the middle.

00:08:31.849 --> 00:08:33.754
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:37.297
but our concept of economy
is growth with percent.

00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:42.369
We look upon it as a possibility
of percentile increase.

00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:47.320
If I change this, and take GDP per capita
instead of family income,

00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:51.070
and I turn these individual data

00:08:51.094 --> 00:08:54.136
into regional data
of gross domestic product,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.461
and I take the regions down here,

00:08:56.485 --> 00:08:58.724
the size of the bubble
is still the population.

00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.946
And you have the OECD there,
and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.976
and we take off the Arab states there,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.976
coming both from Africa and from Asia,
and we put them separately,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.976
and we can expand this axis,
and I can give it a new dimension here,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.362
by adding the social values
there, child survival.

00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:18.550
Now I have money on that axis,

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:21.267
and I have the possibility
of children to survive there.

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:25.437
In some countries, 99.7% of children
survive to five years of age;

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.186
others, only 70.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.285
And here, it seems,
there is a gap between OECD,

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:33.554
Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,

00:09:33.578 --> 00:09:37.470
Arab states, South Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:42.372
The linearity is very strong
between child survival and money.

00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:45.420
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:45.444 --> 00:09:50.665
Health is there
and better health is up there.

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:54.976
I can go here and I can split
sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.577
And when it burst,

00:09:56.601 --> 00:10:00.247
the size of its country bubble
is the size of the population.

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.811
Sierra Leone down there.
Mauritius is up there.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.902
Mauritius was the first country

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:08.327
to get away with trade barriers,
and they could sell their sugar --

00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:09.939
they could sell their textiles --

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:13.603
on equal terms as the people
in Europe and North America.

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:17.104
There's a huge difference between Africa.
And Ghana is here in the middle.

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:19.976
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.926
Here in Uganda, development aid.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.474
Here, time to invest;
there, you can go for a holiday.

00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:29.861
It's a tremendous variation within Africa

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:32.976
which we rarely often make
-- that it's equal everything.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.976
I can split South Asia here.
India's the big bubble in the middle.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.462
But a huge difference
between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.

00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:43.640
I can split Arab states. How are they?

00:10:43.664 --> 00:10:47.800
Same climate, same culture,
same religion -- huge difference.

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:49.157
Even between neighbors.

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.497
Yemen, civil war.

00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:54.864
United Arab Emirates, money,
which was quite equally and well used.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:56.373
Not as the myth is.

00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:59.570
And that includes all the children
of the foreign workers

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:01.481
who are in the country.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:05.976
Data is often better than you think.
Many people say data is bad.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.143
There is an uncertainty margin,
but we can see the difference here:

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.529
Cambodia, Singapore.

00:11:10.553 --> 00:11:13.524
The differences are much bigger
than the weakness of the data.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:18.195
East Europe: Soviet economy
for a long time,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.431
but they come out after 10 years
very, very differently.

00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:24.077
And there is Latin America.

00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:25.822
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba

00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:27.910
to find a healthy country
in Latin America.

00:11:27.934 --> 00:11:32.568
Chile will have a lower child mortality
than Cuba within some few years from now.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.647
Here, we have high-income
countries in the OECD.

00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:39.380
And we get the whole pattern
here of the world,

00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:41.450
which is more or less like this.

00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:46.565
And if we look at it, how the world looks,

00:11:46.617 --> 00:11:49.976
in 1960, it starts to move.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.569
This is Mao Tse-tung.
He brought health to China.

00:11:52.593 --> 00:11:53.727
And then he died.

00:11:53.751 --> 00:11:56.458
And then Deng Xiaoping came
and brought money to China,

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.536
and brought them
into the mainstream again.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.718
And we have seen how countries
move in different directions like this,

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:08.107
so it's sort of difficult to get
an example country

00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:10.790
which shows the pattern of the world.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.172
But I would like to bring you back
to about here, at 1960.

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:21.373
I would like to compare

00:12:21.397 --> 00:12:28.087
South Korea, which is this one,
with Brazil, which is this one.

00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:30.968
The label went away for me here.

00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:33.588
And I would like to compare Uganda,
which is there.

00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.730
And I can run it forward, like this.

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:46.380
And you can see how South Korea is making
a very, very fast advancement,

00:12:46.404 --> 00:12:48.976
whereas Brazil is much slower.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.334
And if we move back again, here,
and we put on trails on them, like this,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.976
you can see again
that the speed of development

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.814
is very, very different,

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:08.539
and the countries are moving more or less
in the same rate as money and health,

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:10.437
but it seems you can move much faster

00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:13.120
if you are healthy first
than if you are wealthy first.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.976
And to show that, you can put
on the way of United Arab Emirates.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.856
They came from here, a mineral country.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.205
They cached all the oil;
they got all the money;

00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:25.468
but health cannot be bought
at the supermarket.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:29.612
You have to invest in health.
You have to get kids into schooling.

00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:32.779
You have to train health staff.
You have to educate the population.

00:13:32.803 --> 00:13:35.257
And Sheikh Zayed did that
in a fairly good way.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.976
In spite of falling oil prices,
he brought this country up here.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.976
So we've got a much more mainstream
appearance of the world,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.527
where all countries tend
to use their money

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.662
better than they used in the past.

00:13:48.755 --> 00:13:55.727
Now, this is, more or less, if you look
at the average data of the countries --

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:57.399
they are like this.

00:13:57.423 --> 00:14:00.765
Now that's dangerous, to use average data,

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:04.560
because there is such
a lot of difference within countries.

00:14:04.584 --> 00:14:11.003
So if I go and look here,
we can see that Uganda today

00:14:11.027 --> 00:14:13.976
is where South Korea was in 1960.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.666
If I split Uganda, there's quite
a difference within Uganda.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.868
These are the quintiles of Uganda.

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:22.076
The richest 20 percent
of Ugandans are there.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.485
The poorest are down there.

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:26.385
If I split South Africa, it's like this.

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:29.152
And if I go down and look at Niger,

00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:33.820
where there was such
a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.

00:14:33.844 --> 00:14:36.738
The 20 percent poorest
of Niger is out here,

00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:39.531
and the 20 percent richest
of South Africa is there,

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:41.573
and yet we tend to discuss

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:43.976
on what solutions
there should be in Africa.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.567
Everything in this world exists in Africa.

00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.866
And you can't discuss
universal access to HIV [medicine]

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.262
for that quintile up here
with the same strategy as down here.

00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:57.824
The improvement of the world
must be highly contextualized,

00:14:57.848 --> 00:15:01.778
and it's not relevant to have it
on regional level.

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:03.332
We must be much more detailed.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.396
We find that students get
very excited when they can use this.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.038
And even more, policy makers
and the corporate sectors

00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:14.723
would like to see
how the world is changing.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.435
Now, why doesn't this take place?

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:18.949
Why are we not using the data we have?

00:15:18.973 --> 00:15:22.783
We have data in the United Nations,
in the national statistical agencies

00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:25.976
and in universities and other
non-governmental organizations.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.334
Because the data is hidden
down in the databases.

00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:31.290
And the public is there,
and the Internet is there,

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.476
but we have still not used it effectively.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.976
All that information
we saw changing in the world

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.139
does not include
publicly-funded statistics.

00:15:39.163 --> 00:15:41.317
There are some web pages
like this, you know,

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:45.976
but they take some nourishment
down from the databases,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.976
but people put prices on them,
stupid passwords and boring statistics.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.389
(Laughter)

00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:53.588
And this won't work.

00:15:53.612 --> 00:15:56.415
(Applause)

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:58.861
So what is needed? We have the databases.

00:15:58.885 --> 00:16:00.662
It's not the new database you need.

00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:04.412
We have wonderful design tools,
and more and more are added up here.

00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:07.307
So we started a nonprofit venture

00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:11.702
which, linking data to design,
we called Gapminder,

00:16:11.726 --> 00:16:13.079
from the London Underground,

00:16:13.103 --> 00:16:14.880
where they warn you, "mind the gap."

00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:16.844
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.

00:16:16.868 --> 00:16:21.224
And we started to write software
which could link the data like this.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.795
And it wasn't that difficult.

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:26.370
It took some person years,
and we have produced animations.

00:16:26.394 --> 00:16:28.727
You can take a data set and put it there.

00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:32.976
We are liberating U.N. data,
some few U.N. organization.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.500
Some countries accept that
their databases can go out on the world,

00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:40.595
but what we really need is,
of course, a search function.

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:44.976
A search function where we can copy
the data up to a searchable format

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.732
and get it out in the world.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.127
And what do we hear when we go around?

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:52.158
I've done anthropology
on the main statistical units.

00:16:52.182 --> 00:16:55.302
Everyone says, "It's impossible.
This can't be done.

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.836
Our information is so peculiar in detail,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.964
so that cannot be searched
as others can be searched.

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:03.343
We cannot give the data
free to the students,

00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:05.272
free to the entrepreneurs of the world."

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:09.151
But this is what we would
like to see, isn't it?

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.599
The publicly-funded data is down here.

00:17:11.623 --> 00:17:14.658
And we would like flowers
to grow out on the Net.

00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:17.849
And one of the crucial points
is to make them searchable,

00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:22.117
and then people can use the different
design tool to animate it there.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.581
And I have pretty good news for you.

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:26.799
I have good news that the present,

00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:29.976
new Head of U.N. Statistics,
he doesn't say it's impossible.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.772
He only says, "We can't do it."

00:17:32.772 --> 00:17:35.976
(Laughter)

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.976
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.976
(Laughter)

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.976
So we can see a lot happening
in data in the coming years.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.660
We will be able to look at income
distributions in completely new ways.

00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:53.976
This is the income distribution
of China, 1970.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.796
This is the income distribution
of the United States, 1970.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.869
Almost no overlap.

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:03.343
And what has happened?

00:18:03.673 --> 00:18:05.351
What has happened is this:

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:08.347
that China is growing,
it's not so equal any longer,

00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:11.976
and it's appearing here,
overlooking the United States.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.658
Almost like a ghost, isn't it?

00:18:14.682 --> 00:18:15.976
(Laughter)

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.587
It's pretty scary.

00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.872
(Laughter)

00:18:22.762 --> 00:18:26.572
But I think it's very important
to have all this information.

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:29.209
We need really to see it.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.976
And instead of looking at this,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.648
I would like to end up by showing
the Internet users per 1,000.

00:18:37.672 --> 00:18:40.554
In this software, we access
about 500 variables

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.979
from all the countries quite easily.

00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:45.976
It takes some time to change for this,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.855
but on the axises, you can quite easily
get any variable you would like to have.

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:56.386
And the thing would be
to get up the databases free,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.976
to get them searchable,
and with a second click,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.976
to get them into the graphic formats,
where you can instantly understand them.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.102
Now, statisticians don't like it,

00:19:06.126 --> 00:19:13.094
because they say
that this will not show the reality;

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:16.839
we have to have statistical,
analytical methods.

00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:18.976
But this is hypothesis-generating.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.905
I end now with the world.

00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:23.506
There, the Internet is coming.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.013
The number of Internet users
are going up like this.

00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:28.006
This is the GDP per capita.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.515
And it's a new technology coming in,
but then amazingly,

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:35.258
how well it fits to the economy
of the countries.

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:38.739
That's why the $100 computer
will be so important.

00:19:38.763 --> 00:19:40.168
But it's a nice tendency.

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:43.096
It's as if the world
is flattening off, isn't it?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.525
These countries are lifting more
than the economy

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:48.334
and will be very interesting
to follow this over the year,

00:19:48.358 --> 00:19:51.719
as I would like you to be able to do
with all the publicly funded data.

00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:52.976
Thank you very much.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
(Applause)
