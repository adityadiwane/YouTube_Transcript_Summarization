00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:16.305
Good afternoon, I'm proud
to be here at TEDxKrakow.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.326
I'll try to speak a little bit today
about a phenomenon

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.352
which can, and actually is
changing the world,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.368
and whose name is people power.

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:25.900
I'll start with an anecdote,

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:29.047
or for those of you
who are Monty Python lovers,

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.518
a Monty Python type of sketch.

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:31.573
Here it is.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.732
It is December 15, 2010.

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:38.238
Somebody gives you a bet:
you will look at a crystal ball,

00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:40.929
and you will see the future;
the future will be accurate.

00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:42.873
But you need to share it with the world.

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:45.995
OK, curiosity killed the cat,
you take the bet,

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.529
you look at the crystal ball.

00:00:47.553 --> 00:00:51.092
One hour later, you're sitting
in a building of the national TV,

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:53.648
in a top show, and you tell the story.

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.756
Before the end of 2011,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.929
Ben Ali, and Mubarak,
and Gaddafi would be down,

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:02.331
and prosecuted.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.197
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.659
would be either challenged,
or already on their knees.

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:10.677
Osama bin Laden would be dead,

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:12.944
and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.967
Now, the anchor watches you
with a strange gaze on his face.

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:18.809
And then, on top of it you add:

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:22.698
"And thousands of young people
from Athens, Madrid and New York

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:26.901
will demonstrate for social justice,
claiming they are inspired by Arabs."

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:30.563
Next thing you know,
two guys in white appear,

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:32.801
they give you the strange t-shirt,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.880
take you to the nearest
mental institution.

00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:36.767
So I would like to speak a little bit

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.640
about the phenomenon which is behind
what already seems to be

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:43.355
a very bad year for bad guys.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:45.950
And this phenomenon
is called people power.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.923
Well, people power
has been there for a while.

00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:51.918
It helped Gandhi kick
the Brits from India,

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:56.049
it helped Martin Luther King
win his historic racial struggle.

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:58.436
It helped a local, Lech Walesa,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.856
to kick out one million
Soviet troops from Poland,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.078
and in beginning the end
of the Soviet Union as we know it.

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:06.745
So what's new in it?

00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:08.741
What seems to be very new,

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:11.337
which is the idea I would like
to share with you today,

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:13.799
is that there is a set of rules and skills

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:16.281
which can be learned and taught

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:19.729
in order to perform
successful nonviolent struggle.

00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:22.500
If this is true, we can help
these movements.

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.350
Well, the first one - analytic skills.

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:29.200
I'll try where it all started
in the Middle East.

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:30.822
And for so many years,

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:35.250
we were living with a completely wrong
perception of the Middle East.

00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:37.177
It was looking like the frozen region.

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.910
Literally a refrigerator.

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:40.982
And there were only
two types of meal there.

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:47.255
Steak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali
type of military police dictatorship,

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.933
or a potato, which stands for
a Tehran type of theocracies.

00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:54.267
And everybody was amazed
when the refrigerator opened,

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:57.222
and millions of young,
mainly secular people

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.296
stepped out to do the change.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.707
Guess what - they didn't watch
the demographics.

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:05.123
What is the average age
of an Egyptian? 24.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.506
How long was Mubarak in power? 31.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.413
So, this system was just
obsolete, they expired.

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:14.847
And young people of the Arab world
have awakened one morning,

00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:18.202
and understood that power
lies in their hands.

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:20.249
The rest is the year in front of us.

00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:23.121
And guess what? The same Generation Y,

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.027
with their rules, with their tools,
with their games,

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.365
and with their language,
which sounds a little bit strange to me.

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.233
I'm 38 now.

00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:34.770
And can you look at the age
of the people on the streets of Europe?

00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:39.001
It seems that Generation Y is coming.

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.714
Now, let me set another example.

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:44.095
I'm meeting different people
throughout the world,

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.246
and they are, you know, academics,
and professors, and doctors,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.144
and they will always talk conditions.

00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:53.197
They will say: "People power will work
only if the regime is not too oppressive."

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:55.206
They will say: "People power will work,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.046
if the annual income of the country
is between X and Z."

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.720
They will say: "People power will work
only if there is a foreign pressure."

00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:05.826
They will say: "People power
will work only if there is no oil."

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.934
And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.584
Well, the news here
is that your skills during the conflict

00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:15.498
seem to be more important
than the conditions.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:20.109
Namely, the skills of unity, planning,
and maintaining nonviolent discipline.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.522
Let me give you an example.

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:23.607
I come from a country called Serbia.

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:28.185
It took us 10 years to unite
18 opposition party leaders,

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:31.589
with their big egos,
behind one single candidate

00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:34.240
against the Balkan dictator
Slobodan Milosevic.

00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:36.653
Guess what? That was
the day of his defeat.

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:39.899
You look at the Egyptians,
they fight on Tahrir Square,

00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:41.983
they get rid of their individual symbols,

00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:44.902
they appear on the street
only with the flag of Egypt.

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:46.943
I will give you a counter-example.

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:50.657
You see nine presidential candidates
running against Lukashenko,

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.260
you all know the outcome.

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:54.374
So unity is a big thing.

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:55.700
And this can be achieved.

00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:56.906
Same with planning.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.301
Somebody has lied to you

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:02.078
about the successful and spontaneous
nonviolent revolution.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.109
That thing doesn't exist in the world.

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:06.982
Whenever you see young people
in front of the row

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.482
trying to fraternize
with the police or military,

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:11.672
somebody was thinking about it before.

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:14.205
Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.698
And this is probably the game-changer.

00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:19.092
If you maintain nonviolent discipline,

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:20.581
you'll exclusively win.

00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:23.558
You have 100,000 people
in a nonviolent march,

00:05:23.582 --> 00:05:26.336
one idiot or agent-provocateur
throwing a stone.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.070
Guess what takes all the cameras.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.188
That one guy.

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:33.540
One single act of violence
can literally destroy your movement.

00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:36.151
Now, let me move to another place.

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:38.271
It's the selection
of strategies and tactics.

00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:42.089
There are certain rules
in nonviolent struggle you may follow.

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:43.741
First, you start small.

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:46.530
Second, you pick the battles you can win.

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.188
It's only 200 of us in this room.

00:05:49.212 --> 00:05:51.529
We won't call for the march of a million.

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:54.977
But what if we organized the spraying
of graffiti throughout the night,

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.408
all over Krakow.

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:57.576
The city will know.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.901
So, we pick tactics
accommodated to the event,

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:04.972
especially this thing we call
the small tactics of dispersion.

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:08.909
They're very useful in violent oppression.

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:13.129
We are actually witnessing the picture
of one of the best tactics ever used.

00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:15.224
It was on Tahrir square,

00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:18.524
where the international community
was constantly frightened

00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:21.711
that, you know, the Islamists
will overtake the revolution.

00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:23.108
What they organized --

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.609
Christians protecting Muslims
where they are praying,

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:28.221
a Coptic wedding cheered
by thousands of Muslims,

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.265
the world has just changed the picture,

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.289
but somebody was thinking
about this previously.

00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:35.243
So there are so many things you can do

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:37.584
instead of getting into one place,

00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:42.192
shouting, and you know, showing off
in front of the security forces.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:45.959
Now, there is also another
very important dynamic.

00:06:45.983 --> 00:06:49.236
And this is a dynamic
that analysts normally don't see.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.957
This is the dynamic between
fear and apathy on the one side,

00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:55.893
and enthusiasm and humor on another side.

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:57.647
So, it works like in a video game.

00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:00.055
You have the fear high,
you have status quo.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.143
You have the enthusiasm higher,

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:03.977
you see the fear is starting to melt.

00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:06.723
Day two, you see people
running towards the police

00:07:06.747 --> 00:07:09.308
instead of from the police, in Egypt.

00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:11.912
You can tell that something
is happening there.

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:13.921
And then, it's about the humor.

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:16.428
Humor is such a powerful game-changer,

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:18.425
and of course, it was very big in Poland.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.992
You know, we were just a small group
of crazy students in Serbia

00:07:22.016 --> 00:07:24.132
when we made this big skit.

00:07:24.156 --> 00:07:26.601
We put the big petrol barrel

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:31.288
with a portrait of Mr. President on it,
in the middle of the Main Street.

00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:32.893
There was a hole in the top.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.678
So you could literally come,
put a coin in,

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:38.567
get a baseball bat, and hit his face.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.837
Sounds loud.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.137
And within minutes,

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.518
we were sitting in a nearby café
having coffee,

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:48.314
and there was a queue of people
waiting to do this lovely thing.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.868
Well, that's just
the beginning of the show.

00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:53.025
The real show starts
when the police appears.

00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:54.270
(Laughter)

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.428
"What will they do?"

00:07:55.452 --> 00:07:57.344
Arrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.

00:07:57.368 --> 00:08:00.822
We were like three blocks away,
observing it from our espresso bar.

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:03.131
Arrest the shoppers, with kids?

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:04.361
Doesn't make sense.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:07.052
Of course, you could bet,
they did the most stupid thing.

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.348
They arrested the barrel.

00:08:08.648 --> 00:08:11.566
And now, the picture
of the smashed face on the barrel,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.900
with the policemen
dragging it to the police car,

00:08:13.924 --> 00:08:17.123
that was the best day
for newspaper photographers

00:08:17.147 --> 00:08:18.374
that they will ever have.

00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:21.068
So, I mean, these are
the things you can do.

00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:22.491
And you can always use humor.

00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:24.790
There is also one big thing about humor,

00:08:24.814 --> 00:08:26.093
it really hurts.

00:08:26.117 --> 00:08:29.709
Because these guys really are
taking themselves too seriously.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.106
When you start to mock them, it hurts.

00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:37.019
Now, everybody is talking
about His Majesty, the Internet,

00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:38.866
and it is also a very useful skill.

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:43.414
But don't rush to label things
like "a Facebook Revolution,"

00:08:43.438 --> 00:08:44.592
"Twitter Revolution."

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:47.419
Don't mix the tools
with the substance.

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:51.453
It is true that the Internet
and the new media are very useful

00:08:51.477 --> 00:08:54.010
in making things faster and cheaper.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.857
They also make it a bit safer
for the participants,

00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:58.873
because they give partial anonymity.

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:02.801
We're watching the great example
of something else the Internet can do.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.352
It can put the price tag
of state-sponsored violence

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:07.971
over a nonviolent protester.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:10.471
This is the famous group
"We are all Khaled Said,"

00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:12.812
made by Wael Ghonim
in Egypt, and his friend.

00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:16.699
This is the mutilated face of the guy
who was beaten by the police.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.723
This is how he became known to the public,

00:09:18.747 --> 00:09:22.495
and this is what probably became
the straw that broke the camel's back.

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:24.573
But here is also the bad news.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:27.904
The nonviolent struggle is won
in the real world, in the streets.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:32.468
You will never change
your society towards democracy,

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:35.881
or, you know, the economy,
if you sit down and click.

00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:37.322
There are risks to be taken,

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:40.465
and there are living people
who are winning the struggle.

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.737
Well, the million-dollar question.

00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:44.668
What will happen in the Arab world?

00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:46.692
And though young people
from the Arab world

00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:49.964
were pretty successful
in bringing down three dictators,

00:09:49.988 --> 00:09:52.384
shaking the region,

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:55.563
kind of persuading the clever kings
from Jordan and Morocco

00:09:55.587 --> 00:09:57.382
to do substantial reforms,

00:09:57.406 --> 00:10:00.994
it is yet to be seen
what will be the outcome.

00:10:01.487 --> 00:10:05.412
Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians
will make it through the transition,

00:10:05.436 --> 00:10:09.047
or this will end in bloody
ethnic and religious conflicts,

00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:14.293
whether the Syrians
will maintain nonviolent discipline,

00:10:14.317 --> 00:10:18.117
faced with a brutal daily violence
which kills thousands already,

00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.252
or they will slip into violent struggle

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.768
and make ugly civil war.

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:28.667
Will these revolutions be pushed
through the transitions and democracy

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:32.442
or be overtaken by the military
or extremists of all kinds?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.030
We cannot tell.

00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:36.895
The same works for the Western sector,

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:39.185
where you can see
all these excited young people

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:42.950
protesting around the world,
occupying this, occupying that.

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.285
Are they going to become the world wave?

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:51.944
Are they going to find their skills,
their enthusiasm, and their strategy

00:10:51.968 --> 00:10:55.238
to find what they really want
and push for the reform,

00:10:55.262 --> 00:10:59.491
or will they just stay complaining
about the endless list

00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:01.335
of the things they hate?

00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:04.750
This is the difference
between the two paths.

00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:07.273
Now, what do the statistics have?

00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:10.191
My friend Maria Stephan's book

00:11:10.215 --> 00:11:12.915
talks a lot about violent
and nonviolent struggle,

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.566
and there are some shocking data.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.852
If you look at the last 35 years
and different social transitions,

00:11:19.876 --> 00:11:21.718
from dictatorship to democracy,

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:25.071
you will see that,
out of 67 different cases,

00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:28.705
in 50 of these cases
it was nonviolent struggle

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.340
which was the key power.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:34.428
This is one more reason
to look at this phenomenon,

00:11:34.452 --> 00:11:37.291
this is one more reason
to look at Generation Y.

00:11:38.013 --> 00:11:40.065
Enough for me to give them credit,

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:44.957
and hope that they will find their skills
and their courage

00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:46.644
to use nonviolent struggle

00:11:46.668 --> 00:11:51.741
and thus fix at least a part of the mess
our generation is making in this world.

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:52.828
Thank you.

00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:55.222
(Applause)
