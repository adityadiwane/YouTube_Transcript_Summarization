00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So let me just start with my story.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
playing soccer in college.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and then developed an arthritic knee.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and, by the way, I married a woman

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
who has exactly the same story.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So with that, let me just show you a quick video

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Narrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but there's another disease

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
arthritis ruins more lives.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
you'll develop arthritis.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to design artificial components

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
to replace our worn-out body parts,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
but in the midst of the modern buzz

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
around the promises of a bionic body,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Let's consider an alternative path.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
What if all the replacements our bodies need

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
already exist in nature,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
or within our own stem cells?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
This is the field of biologic replacements,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is:

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
how do I treat these things biologically?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
First thing for my wife,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and the most common thing I hear from my patients,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is they come in and say,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I'm not ready for joint replacement."

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
right into that [knee] joint space.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And then for that unstable ligament,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we put in a human donor ligament

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
to stabilize the knee.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
we did a stem cell paste graft,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
which we designed in 1991,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to regrow that articular cartilage surface

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and give it back a smooth surface there.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and her just hiking now

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
four months later in Aspen, and doing well.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
just won the Superpipe in Aspen

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
just nine months after having destroyed her knee,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
as you see in the other image --

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and having a paste graft to that knee.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So with all this success,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
why isn't that good enough, you might ask.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
There's not enough young, healthy people

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
falling off their motorcycle

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and donating that tissue to us.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And the tissue's very expensive.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And so that's not going to be a solution

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But the solution is animal tissue

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
because it's plentiful, it's cheap,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
you can get it from young, healthy tissues,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
but the barrier is immunology.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And the specific barrier

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
is a specific epitope

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So my story in working with animal tissues

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
starts in 1984.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And I started first

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
with cow Achilles tendon,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
where we would take the cow Achilles tendon,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
which is type-I collagen,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
strip it of its antigens

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and forming it into a regeneration template.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
We would then take that regeneration template

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to regrow that in a patient's knee.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
We've now done that procedure,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to regrow the meniscus.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
I can't grind it up in a blender.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So in that case,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
an enzyme wash

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to wash away, or strip,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
those galactosyl epitopes

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
with a specific enzyme.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
What we do is humanize the tissue.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
It's by gal stripping that tissue

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
we humanize it (Laughter),

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and then we can put it back

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
into a patient's knee.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
young, healthy, big tissue,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial --

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and then one of our patients went on to have

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
three Canadian Masters Downhill championships --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So what about the next step?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
not just the parts?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Well here's how we're going to do it.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
So what we're going to do is take

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
an articular cartilage

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
from a young, healthy pig,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
strip it of its antigens,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
load it with your stem cells,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
then put it back on to that

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
arthritic surface in your knee,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
tack it on there, have you heal that surface

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So that's our biologic approach right now.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
There's a benefit of 400 million years

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
of ambulation.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
We can harness those benefits.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
than you might have injured in your knee,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
We can strip that tissue very economically,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
to go global.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
And so welcome to super biologics.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's not hardware.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
It's not software.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
It's bioware.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
It's version 2.0 of you.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And so with that, coming to a --

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
(Laughter)

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Thank you very much.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
(Applause)
