00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.144
For me they normally happen,
these career crises,

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.715
often, actually, on a Sunday evening,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.612
just as the sun is starting to set,

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:24.294
and the gap between my hopes for myself
and the reality of my life

00:00:24.318 --> 00:00:26.136
starts to diverge so painfully

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.136
that I normally end up
weeping into a pillow.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.665
I'm mentioning all this --

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.372
I'm mentioning all this because I think
this is not merely a personal problem;

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:35.932
you may think I'm wrong in this,

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:39.539
but I think we live in an age
when our lives are regularly punctuated

00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:42.705
by career crises, by moments
when what we thought we knew --

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.539
about our lives, about our careers --

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:47.992
comes into contact
with a threatening sort of reality.

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:51.769
It's perhaps easier now than ever before
to make a good living.

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:54.136
It's perhaps harder than ever before

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.136
to stay calm, to be free
of career anxiety.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.549
I want to look now, if I may,
at some of the reasons

00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:04.136
why we might be feeling
anxiety about our careers.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.399
Why we might be victims
of these career crises,

00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:10.369
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:13.136
One of the reasons
why we might be suffering

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.718
is that we are surrounded by snobs.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.136
In a way, I've got some bad news,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.922
particularly to anybody
who's come to Oxford from abroad.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:22.724
There's a real problem with snobbery,

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.914
because sometimes people
from outside the U.K.

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:27.645
imagine that snobbery
is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:30.136
fixated on country houses and titles.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.824
The bad news is that's not true.

00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:34.824
Snobbery is a global phenomenon;
we are a global organization,

00:01:34.848 --> 00:01:36.205
this is a global phenomenon.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.864
What is a snob?

00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:41.197
A snob is anybody who takes
a small part of you,

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.586
and uses that to come
to a complete vision of who you are.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.136
That is snobbery.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.485
The dominant kind of snobbery
that exists nowadays is job snobbery.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.756
You encounter it within minutes
at a party, when you get asked

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.947
that famous iconic question
of the early 21st century,

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.144
"What do you do?"

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:00.169
According to how you answer that question,

00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:02.527
people are either incredibly
delighted to see you,

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.733
or look at their watch
and make their excuses.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:05.773
(Laughter)

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:08.136
Now, the opposite of a snob
is your mother.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.136
(Laughter)

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.137
Not necessarily your mother,
or indeed mine,

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:14.796
but, as it were, the ideal mother,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.168
somebody who doesn't care
about your achievements.

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.390
Unfortunately, most people
are not our mothers.

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:22.232
Most people make a strict correlation
between how much time,

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:23.649
and if you like, love --

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:26.136
not romantic love,
though that may be something --

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.455
but love in general, respect --
they are willing to accord us,

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.136
that will be strictly defined
by our position in the social hierarchy.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.399
And that's a lot of the reason
why we care so much about our careers

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:40.136
and indeed start caring
so much about material goods.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.399
You know, we're often told
that we live in very materialistic times,

00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:45.136
that we're all greedy people.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.446
I don't think we are
particularly materialistic.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.898
I think we live in a society which has
simply pegged certain emotional rewards

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.134
to the acquisition of material goods.

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:57.088
It's not the material goods we want;
it's the rewards we want.

00:02:57.112 --> 00:02:59.120
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:02.105
The next time you see somebody
driving a Ferrari, don't think,

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.953
"This is somebody who's greedy."

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:07.695
Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly
vulnerable and in need of love."

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.136
(Laughter)

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.563
Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:15.095
There are other reasons --

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:16.136
(Laughter)

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.082
There are other reasons why it's perhaps
harder now to feel calm than ever before.

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:21.782
One of these, and it's paradoxical,

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:24.316
because it's linked to something
that's rather nice,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.386
is the hope we all have for our careers.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.508
Never before have
expectations been so high

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:31.255
about what human beings can
achieve with their lifespan.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.308
We're told, from many sources,
that anyone can achieve anything.

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.215
We've done away with the caste system,

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.930
we are now in a system where anyone
can rise to any position they please.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.136
And it's a beautiful idea.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.613
Along with that is a kind
of spirit of equality;

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:45.994
we're all basically equal.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:50.136
There are no strictly defined hierarchies.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.622
There is one really big problem with this,

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:54.154
and that problem is envy.

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.942
Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.446
but if there's one dominant emotion
in modern society, that is envy.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.137
And it's linked to the spirit of equality.

00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:04.312
Let me explain.

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:07.597
I think it would be very unusual
for anyone here, or anyone watching,

00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:09.493
to be envious of the Queen of England.

00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:12.754
Even though she is much richer
than any of you are,

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:15.040
and she's got a very large house,

00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:18.722
the reason why we don't envy her
is because she's too weird.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:19.754
(Laughter)

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:21.135
She's simply too strange.

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.540
We can't relate to her,
she speaks in a funny way,

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:24.937
she comes from an odd place.

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.334
So we can't relate to her,

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:29.256
and when you can't relate
to somebody, you don't envy them.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.136
The closer two people are --
in age, in background,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.478
in the process of identification --
the more there's a danger of envy,

00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:38.977
which is incidentally why none of you
should ever go to a school reunion,

00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:43.100
because there is no stronger reference
point than people one was at school with.

00:04:43.124 --> 00:04:46.662
The problem of modern society is
it turns the whole world into a school.

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.956
Everybody's wearing jeans,
everybody's the same.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.135
And yet, they're not.

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.136
So there's a spirit of equality
combined with deep inequality,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.851
which can make for
a very stressful situation.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.200
It's probably as unlikely
that you would nowadays

00:04:58.224 --> 00:05:00.136
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.136
as it was unlikely in the 17th century

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.402
that you would accede to the ranks
of the French aristocracy.

00:05:05.426 --> 00:05:07.474
But the point is,
it doesn't feel that way.

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:10.564
It's made to feel, by magazines
and other media outlets,

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:14.444
that if you've got energy, a few bright
ideas about technology, a garage --

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:16.899
you, too, could start a major thing.

00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:18.278
(Laughter)

00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:21.541
The consequences of this problem
make themselves felt in bookshops.

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:24.756
When you go to a large bookshop
and look at the self-help sections,

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.960
as I sometimes do --

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:29.070
if you analyze self-help books
produced in the world today,

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:30.541
there are basically two kinds.

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:34.351
The first kind tells you, "You can do it!
You can make it! Anything's possible!"

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:38.971
The other kind tells you how to cope with
what we politely call "low self-esteem,"

00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:41.622
or impolitely call,
"feeling very bad about yourself."

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:43.136
There's a real correlation

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.136
between a society that tells people
that they can do anything,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.136
and the existence of low self-esteem.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.136
So that's another way in which something
quite positive can have a nasty kickback.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.485
There is another reason why
we might be feeling more anxious --

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.136
about our careers, about our status
in the world today, than ever before.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.208
And it's, again, linked to something nice.

00:06:02.232 --> 00:06:04.930
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.

00:06:04.954 --> 00:06:07.256
Everybody, all politicians
on Left and Right,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.497
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,

00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:13.667
and we should all be trying to make
our societies really, really meritocratic.

00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:17.010
In other words --
what is a meritocratic society?

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:21.160
A meritocratic society is one in which,
if you've got talent and energy and skill,

00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:23.756
you will get to the top,
nothing should hold you back.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.942
It's a beautiful idea.

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:28.290
The problem is, if you
really believe in a society

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:30.982
where those who merit to get
to the top, get to the top,

00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:34.011
you'll also, by implication,
and in a far more nasty way,

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:37.732
believe in a society where those
who deserve to get to the bottom

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:39.979
also get to the bottom and stay there.

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:43.351
In other words, your position in life
comes to seem not accidental,

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:45.136
but merited and deserved.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.136
And that makes failure
seem much more crushing.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.538
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,

00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:52.434
when you met a very poor person,

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:55.322
that person would be described
as an "unfortunate" --

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:59.136
literally, somebody who had not
been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.256
Nowadays, particularly
in the United States,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.423
if you meet someone
at the bottom of society,

00:07:03.447 --> 00:07:06.136
they may unkindly be
described as a "loser."

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.136
There's a real difference
between an unfortunate and a loser,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.136
and that shows 400 years
of evolution in society

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.257
and our belief in who
is responsible for our lives.

00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:18.136
It's no longer the gods, it's us.
We're in the driving seat.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.136
That's exhilarating if you're doing well,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.012
and very crushing if you're not.

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:23.578
It leads, in the worst cases --

00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:26.569
in the analysis of a sociologist
like Emil Durkheim --

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:28.900
it leads to increased rates of suicide.

00:07:28.924 --> 00:07:32.136
There are more suicides
in developed, individualistic countries

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.901
than in any other part of the world.

00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:35.499
And some of the reason for that

00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:38.592
is that people take what happens to them
extremely personally --

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:42.135
they own their success,
but they also own their failure.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:44.446
Is there any relief
from some of these pressures

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.807
that I've been outlining?

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.990
I think there is.

00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:48.780
I just want to turn to a few of them.

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:50.136
Let's take meritocracy.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.136
This idea that everybody deserves
to get where they get to,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.968
I think it's a crazy idea,
completely crazy.

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:58.244
I will support any politician
of Left and Right,

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:00.562
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:02.136
I am a meritocrat in that sense.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.832
But I think it's insane to believe

00:08:03.856 --> 00:08:07.313
that we will ever make a society
that is genuinely meritocratic;

00:08:07.337 --> 00:08:08.571
it's an impossible dream.

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:12.056
The idea that we will make a society
where literally everybody is graded,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.976
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.136
exactly done as it
should be, is impossible.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.136
There are simply too many random factors:

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.136
accidents, accidents of birth,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
accidents of things dropping
on people's heads, illnesses, etc.

00:08:23.184 --> 00:08:25.136
We will never get to grade them,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.136
never get to grade people as they should.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.303
I'm drawn to a lovely quote
by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"

00:08:30.327 --> 00:08:34.740
where he says, "It's a sin
to judge any man by his post."

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.406
In modern English that would mean

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.154
it's a sin to come to any view
of who you should talk to,

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:40.761
dependent on their business card.

00:08:40.785 --> 00:08:42.536
It's not the post that should count.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.340
According to St. Augustine, only God
can really put everybody in their place;

00:08:46.364 --> 00:08:48.499
he's going to do that
on the Day of Judgment,

00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:50.905
with angels and trumpets,
and the skies will open.

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:53.436
Insane idea, if you're
a secularist person, like me.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.080
But something very valuable
in that idea, nevertheless.

00:08:56.104 --> 00:08:59.436
In other words, hold your horses
when you're coming to judge people.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.136
You don't necessarily know
what someone's true value is.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.136
That is an unknown part of them,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.355
and we shouldn't behave
as though it is known.

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:10.180
There is another source of solace
and comfort for all this.

00:09:10.204 --> 00:09:13.329
When we think about failing in life,
when we think about failure,

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:15.195
one of the reasons why we fear failing

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:17.494
is not just a loss of income,
a loss of status.

00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:20.261
What we fear is the judgment
and ridicule of others.

00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:21.438
And it exists.

00:09:21.462 --> 00:09:25.018
The number one organ of ridicule,
nowadays, is the newspaper.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.231
If you open the newspaper
any day of the week,

00:09:27.255 --> 00:09:29.571
it's full of people
who've messed up their lives.

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:32.588
They've slept with the wrong person,
taken the wrong substance,

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:34.634
passed the wrong piece of legislation --

00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:36.826
whatever it is, and then
are fit for ridicule.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.135
In other words, they have failed.
And they are described as "losers."

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.987
Now, is there any alternative to this?

00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:46.607
I think the Western tradition shows us one
glorious alternative, which is tragedy.

00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:49.853
Tragic art, as it developed
in the theaters of ancient Greece,

00:09:49.877 --> 00:09:52.647
in the fifth century B.C.,
was essentially an art form

00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:55.136
devoted to tracing how people fail,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.543
and also according them
a level of sympathy,

00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:02.843
which ordinary life would not
necessarily accord them.

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:04.907
A few years ago,
I was thinking about this,

00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:06.526
and I went to "The Sunday Sport,"

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.160
a tabloid newspaper I don't
recommend you start reading

00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:11.081
if you're not familiar with it already.

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:12.113
(Laughter)

00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:13.379
And I went to talk to them

00:10:13.403 --> 00:10:16.144
about certain of the great
tragedies of Western art.

00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:19.753
I wanted to see how they would seize
the bare bones of certain stories,

00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:23.737
if they came in as a news item
at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.

00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.885
I mentioned Othello; they'd not
heard of it but were fascinated.

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:27.917
(Laughter)

00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:30.243
I asked them to write
a headline for the story.

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:33.706
They came up with "Love-Crazed
Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.136
Splashed across the headline.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.

00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:39.375
Again, a book they were
enchanted to discover.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:44.136
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress
Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.176
(Laughter)

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.383
And then my favorite --

00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.486
they really do have a kind of genius
of their own, these guys --

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.604
my favorite is Sophocles'
Oedipus the King:

00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:54.136
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.136
(Laughter)

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.136
(Applause)

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.136
In a way, if you like, at one end
of the spectrum of sympathy,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.953
you've got the tabloid newspaper.

00:11:03.977 --> 00:11:07.168
At the other end of the spectrum,
you've got tragedy and tragic art.

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:09.966
And I suppose I'm arguing
that we should learn a little bit

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.776
about what's happening in tragic art.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.498
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.

00:11:14.522 --> 00:11:16.833
He is not a loser, though he has lost.

00:11:16.857 --> 00:11:19.494
And I think that is the message
of tragedy to us,

00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:22.136
and why it's so very,
very important, I think.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.136
The other thing about modern society
and why it causes this anxiety,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.136
is that we have nothing at its center
that is non-human.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.748
We are the first society
to be living in a world

00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:34.264
where we don't worship
anything other than ourselves.

00:11:34.288 --> 00:11:36.733
We think very highly of ourselves,
and so we should;

00:11:36.757 --> 00:11:40.050
we've put people on the Moon,
done all sorts of extraordinary things.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.367
And so we tend to worship ourselves.
Our heroes are human heroes.

00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:44.954
That's a very new situation.

00:11:44.978 --> 00:11:47.485
Most other societies have had,
right at their center,

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:50.930
the worship of something transcendent:
a god, a spirit, a natural force,

00:11:50.954 --> 00:11:54.304
the universe, whatever it is --
something else that is being worshiped.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.400
We've slightly lost
the habit of doing that,

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.192
which is, I think, why we're
particularly drawn to nature.

00:11:59.216 --> 00:12:02.472
Not for the sake of our health,
though it's often presented that way,

00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:05.136
but because it's an escape
from the human anthill.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.136
It's an escape from our own competition,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.136
and our own dramas.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.780
And that's why we enjoy looking
at glaciers and oceans,

00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:15.755
and contemplating the Earth
from outside its perimeters, etc.

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:19.358
We like to feel in contact
with something that is non-human,

00:12:19.382 --> 00:12:23.136
and that is so deeply important to us.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.351
What I think I've been talking
about really is success and failure.

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:28.804
And one of the interesting
things about success

00:12:28.828 --> 00:12:30.812
is that we think we know what it means.

00:12:30.836 --> 00:12:34.233
If I said that there's somebody
behind the screen who's very successful,

00:12:34.257 --> 00:12:36.634
certain ideas would
immediately come to mind.

00:12:36.658 --> 00:12:39.308
You'd think that person
might have made a lot of money,

00:12:39.332 --> 00:12:41.240
achieved renown in some field.

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:42.593
My own theory of success --

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:44.776
I'm somebody who's
very interested in success,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.281
I really want to be successful,

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:48.487
always thinking,
how can I be more successful?

00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:52.492
But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced
about what that word "success" might mean.

00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:55.079
Here's an insight
that I've had about success:

00:12:55.103 --> 00:12:56.984
You can't be successful at everything.

00:12:57.008 --> 00:12:59.271
We hear a lot of talk
about work-life balance.

00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:00.446
Nonsense.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.136
You can't have it all. You can't.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.635
So any vision of success
has to admit what it's losing out on,

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:08.336
where the element of loss is.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.884
And I think any wise life will accept,

00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:14.684
as I say, that there is going to be
an element where we're not succeeding.

00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:17.716
And the thing about a successful life
is that a lot of the time,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.630
our ideas of what it would mean
to live successfully are not our own.

00:13:21.654 --> 00:13:23.369
They're sucked in from other people;

00:13:23.393 --> 00:13:26.997
chiefly, if you're a man, your father,
and if you're a woman, your mother.

00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:30.386
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home
this message for about 80 years.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.917
No one's quite listening hard enough,
but I very much believe it's true.

00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:37.059
And we also suck in messages
from everything from the television,

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.869
to advertising, to marketing, etc.

00:13:38.893 --> 00:13:41.136
These are hugely powerful forces

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.136
that define what we want
and how we view ourselves.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.136
When we're told that banking
is a very respectable profession,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.136
a lot of us want to go into banking.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.494
When banking is no longer so respectable,
we lose interest in banking.

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:56.576
We are highly open to suggestion.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.497
So what I want to argue for
is not that we should give up

00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:01.136
on our ideas of success,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.351
but we should make sure
that they are our own.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.136
We should focus in on our ideas,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.891
and make sure that we own them;

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:10.336
that we are truly the authors
of our own ambitions.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.161
Because it's bad enough
not getting what you want,

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:16.272
but it's even worse to have
an idea of what it is you want,

00:14:16.296 --> 00:14:18.336
and find out, at the end of the journey,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.524
that it isn't, in fact,
what you wanted all along.

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:23.136
So, I'm going to end it there.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.136
But what I really want to stress is:
by all means, success, yes.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.732
But let's accept the strangeness
of some of our ideas.

00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:33.501
Let's probe away
at our notions of success.

00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:37.136
Let's make sure our ideas of success
are truly our own.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.136
Thank you very much.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.444
(Applause)

00:14:54.858 --> 00:14:56.675
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:02.136
But how do you reconcile this idea

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.930
of it being bad to think
of someone as a "loser,"

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:09.792
with the idea that a lot of people like,
of seizing control of your life,

00:15:09.816 --> 00:15:12.721
and that a society that encourages that,

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.136
perhaps has to have
some winners and losers?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.811
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think
it's merely the randomness

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.501
of the winning and losing process
that I want to stress,

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:24.136
because the emphasis nowadays is so much
on the justice of everything,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.161
and politicians always talk about justice.

00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:29.593
Now I'm a firm believer in justice,
I just think that it's impossible.

00:15:29.617 --> 00:15:33.220
So we should do everything
we can to pursue it,

00:15:33.244 --> 00:15:36.680
but we should always remember
that whoever is facing us,

00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:38.847
whatever has happened in their lives,

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.136
there will be a strong
element of the haphazard.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.376
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.466
otherwise, it can get
quite claustrophobic.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.715
CA: I mean, do you believe
that you can combine

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:50.024
your kind of kinder,
gentler philosophy of work

00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:53.136
with a successful economy?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.942
Or do you think that you can't,

00:15:54.966 --> 00:15:58.640
but it doesn't matter that much that we're
putting too much emphasis on that?

00:15:58.664 --> 00:16:00.136
AB: The nightmare thought

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.136
is that frightening people
is the best way to get work out of them,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.572
and that somehow
the crueler the environment,

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:09.961
the more people will rise
to the challenge.

00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:12.930
You want to think, who would you like
as your ideal dad?

00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:16.136
And your ideal dad is somebody
who is tough but gentle.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.373
And it's a very hard line to make.

00:16:18.397 --> 00:16:22.136
We need fathers, as it were,
the exemplary father figures in society,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.583
avoiding the two extremes,

00:16:24.607 --> 00:16:28.136
which is the authoritarian
disciplinarian on the one hand,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.961
and on the other,
the lax, no-rules option.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:34.358
CA: Alain De Botton.

00:16:34.382 --> 00:16:36.137
AB: Thank you very much.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:42.048
(Applause)
