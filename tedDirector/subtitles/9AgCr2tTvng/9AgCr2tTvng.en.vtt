00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.572
So I know TED is about a lot
of things that are big,

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:20.126
but I want to talk to you
about something very small.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.308
So small, it's a single word.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:24.649
The word is "misfit."

00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:28.966
It's one of my favorite words,
because it's so literal.

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:33.349
I mean, it's a person
who sort of missed fitting in.

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:36.048
Or a person who fits in badly.

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:39.581
Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.473
to new situations and environments."

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:45.520
I'm a card-carrying misfit.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:49.140
And I'm here for the other
misfits in the room,

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:50.975
because I'm never the only one.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:53.880
I'm going to tell you a misfit story.

00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:57.769
Somewhere in my early 30s,

00:00:57.793 --> 00:01:01.355
the dream of becoming a writer
came right to my doorstep.

00:01:02.198 --> 00:01:03.802
Actually, it came to my mailbox

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:07.485
in the form of a letter that said
I'd won a giant literary prize

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.434
for a short story I had written.

00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:13.944
The short story was about my life
as a competitive swimmer

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:16.687
and about my crappy home life,

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:22.155
and a little bit about how grief
and loss can make you insane.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.502
The prize was a trip to New York City
to meet big-time editors and agents

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:29.850
and other authors.

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:33.342
So kind of it was the wannabe
writer's dream, right?

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.413
You know what I did the day
the letter came to my house?

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:39.835
Because I'm me,

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.056
I put the letter on my kitchen table,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.522
I poured myself a giant glass of vodka

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.292
with ice and lime,

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:52.926
and I sat there in my underwear
for an entire day,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.032
just staring at the letter.

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:59.753
I was thinking about all the ways
I'd already screwed my life up.

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:02.951
Who the hell was I to go to New York City

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.705
and pretend to be a writer?

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:07.046
Who was I?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.268
I'll tell you.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:09.912
I was a misfit.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.988
Like legions of other children,

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.276
I came from an abusive household

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.956
that I narrowly escaped with my life.

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:24.218
I already had two epically
failed marriages underneath my belt.

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.208
I'd flunked out of college
not once but twice

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:30.424
and maybe even a third time
that I'm not going to tell you about.

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.258
(Laughter)

00:02:32.582 --> 00:02:36.243
And I'd done an episode
of rehab for drug use.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:41.245
And I'd had two lovely
staycations in jail.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.132
So I'm on the right stage.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.770
(Laughter)

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:52.237
But the real reason,
I think, I was a misfit,

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.523
is that my daughter died
the day she was born,

00:02:55.547 --> 00:02:58.666
and I hadn't figured out
how to live with that story yet.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:05.360
After my daughter died
I also spent a long time homeless,

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.328
living under an overpass

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:11.570
in a kind of profound state
of zombie grief and loss

00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:14.108
that some of us encounter along the way.

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:16.863
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.237
You know, homeless people
are some of our most heroic misfits,

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:25.357
because they start out as us.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.088
So you see, I'd missed fitting in
to just about every category out there:

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:36.580
daughter, wife, mother, scholar.

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.973
And the dream of being a writer

00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:45.438
was really kind of like a small,
sad stone in my throat.

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:50.375
It was pretty much in spite of myself
that I got on that plane

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.786
and flew to New York City,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.366
where the writers are.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.843
Fellow misfits, I can almost
see your heads glowing.

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:00.779
I can pick you out of a room.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.241
At first, you would've loved it.

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:06.217
You got to choose the three
famous writers you wanted to meet,

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.599
and these guys went
and found them for you.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.413
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:14.071
where you got to drink Scotch
late in the night

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:16.586
with cool, smart, swank people.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.119
And you got to pretend you were cool
and smart and swank, too.

00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:24.331
And you got to meet a bunch
of editors and authors and agents

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:28.418
at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.

00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:31.005
Ask me how fancy.

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:33.696
Audience: How fancy?

00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:38.395
Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession:
I stole three linen napkins --

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.990
(Laughter)

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:41.671
from three different restaurants.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.696
And I shoved a menu down my pants.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.796
(Laughter)

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.526
I just wanted some keepsakes
so that when I got home,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.835
I could believe it had really
happened to me.

00:04:53.241 --> 00:04:54.470
You know?

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.131
The three writers I wanted to meet

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:59.964
were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman
and Peggy Phelan.

00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.550
These were not famous,
best-selling authors,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.881
but to me, they were women-writer titans.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.262
Carole Maso wrote the book
that later became my art bible.

00:05:12.056 --> 00:05:14.557
Lynne Tillman gave me
permission to believe

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:18.062
that there was a chance
my stories could be part of the world.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.793
And Peggy Phelan reminded me

00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:25.826
that maybe my brains
could be more important than my boobs.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.184
They weren't mainstream women writers,

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:33.985
but they were cutting a path
through the mainstream

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.342
with their body stories,

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:40.429
I like to think, kind of the way
water cut the Grand Canyon.

00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:43.082
It nearly killed me with joy

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:46.947
to hang out with these three
over-50-year-old women writers.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.897
And the reason it nearly
killed me with joy

00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.990
is that I'd never known a joy like that.

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:53.696
I'd never been in a room like that.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.108
My mother never went to college.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:59.236
And my creative career to that point

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.712
was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:08.673
So kind of in those first nights
in New York I wanted to die there.

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:12.137
I was just like, "Kill me now.
I'm good. This is beautiful."

00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:16.335
Some of you in the room
will understand what happened next.

00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:21.230
First, they took me to the offices
of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:25.038
Farrar, Straus and Giroux
was like my mega-dream press.

00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:28.753
I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor
were published there.

00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:33.793
The main editor guy sat me down
and talked to me for a long time,

00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:36.135
trying to convince me I had a book in me

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.864
about my life as a swimmer.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:39.785
You know, like a memoir.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.866
The whole time he was talking to me,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.595
I sat there smiling and nodding
like a numb idiot,

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.361
with my arms crossed over my chest,

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:54.302
while nothing, nothing, nothing
came out of my throat.

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:59.242
So in the end, he patted me
on the shoulder

00:06:59.266 --> 00:07:00.847
like a swim coach might.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.415
And he wished me luck

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.877
and he gave me some free books

00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:07.692
and he showed me out the door.

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:12.855
Next, they took me
to the offices of W.W. Norton,

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.579
where I was pretty sure
I'd be escorted from the building

00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:17.492
just for wearing Doc Martens.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.639
But that didn't happen.

00:07:20.512 --> 00:07:22.941
Being at the Norton offices

00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:27.437
felt like reaching up into the night sky
and touching the moon

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:31.098
while the stars stitched your name
across the cosmos.

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:33.744
I mean, that's how big
a deal it was to me.

00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:34.949
You get it?

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:38.065
Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:42.432
leaned over right in my face
with these beady, bright, fierce eyes

00:07:42.456 --> 00:07:45.566
and said, "Well, send me
something then, immediately!"

00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:48.620
See, now most people,
especially TED people,

00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:50.984
would have run to the mailbox, right?

00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:54.929
It took me over a decade to even imagine

00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:58.830
putting something in an envelope
and licking a stamp.

00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.315
On the last night,

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:05.608
I gave a big reading
at the National Poetry Club.

00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:08.289
And at the end of the reading,

00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:12.616
Katharine Kidde of Kidde,
Hoyt &amp; Picard Literary Agency,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.227
walked straight up to me and shook my hand

00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:18.429
and offered me representation,
like, on the spot.

00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:23.545
I stood there and I kind of went deaf.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.155
Has this ever happened to you?

00:08:25.703 --> 00:08:27.815
And I almost started crying

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.764
because all the people in the room
were dressed so beautifully,

00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:34.941
and all that came out of my mouth was:

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:38.075
"I don't know. I have to think about it."

00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:43.097
And she said, "OK, then," and walked away.

00:08:44.884 --> 00:08:51.403
All those open hands out to me,
that small, sad stone in my throat ...

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:55.365
You see, I'm trying to tell you something
about people like me.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:59.442
Misfit people -- we don't always know
how to hope or say yes

00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:01.077
or choose the big thing,

00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:03.247
even when it's right in front of us.

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.890
It's a shame we carry.

00:09:04.914 --> 00:09:06.905
It's the shame of wanting something good.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.921
It's the shame of feeling something good.

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:13.327
It's the shame of not really believing
we deserve to be in the room

00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.468
with the people we admire.

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:19.398
If I could, I'd go back
and I'd coach myself.

00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:23.765
I'd be exactly like those
over-50-year-old women who helped me.

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:25.690
I'd teach myself how to want things,

00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:28.054
how to stand up, how to ask for them.

00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:32.384
I'd say, "You! Yeah, you!
You belong in the room, too."

00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:34.680
The radiance falls on all of us,

00:09:34.704 --> 00:09:37.615
and we are nothing without each other.

00:09:39.041 --> 00:09:42.313
Instead, I flew back to Oregon,

00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:48.029
and as I watched the evergreens
and rain come back into view,

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:52.345
I just drank many tiny bottles
of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."

00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:58.333
I thought about how, if I was a writer,
I was some kind of misfit writer.

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:00.403
What I'm saying is,

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:02.431
I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:03.606
without an agent,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.115
and with only a headful
and heart-ful of memories

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:09.287
of having sat so near

00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:11.581
the beautiful writers.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.684
Memory was the only prize
I allowed myself.

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:20.304
And yet, at home in the dark,

00:10:21.272 --> 00:10:22.835
back in my underwear,

00:10:23.788 --> 00:10:25.518
I could still hear their voices.

00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:30.305
They said, "Don't listen to anyone
who tries to get you to shut up

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:31.880
or change your story."

00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:36.540
They said, "Give voice to the story
only you know how to tell."

00:10:36.564 --> 00:10:38.994
They said, "Sometimes telling the story

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.064
is the thing that saves your life."

00:10:43.703 --> 00:10:47.393
Now I am, as you can see,
the woman over 50.

00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:49.453
And I'm a writer.

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.743
And I'm a mother.

00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.978
And I became a teacher.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.851
Guess who my favorite students are.

00:10:58.604 --> 00:11:00.232
Although it didn't happen the day

00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:02.510
that dream letter came through my mailbox,

00:11:02.534 --> 00:11:04.207
I did write a memoir,

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.064
called "The Chronology of Water."

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:11.588
In it are the stories of how many times
I've had to reinvent a self

00:11:11.612 --> 00:11:14.016
from the ruins of my choices,

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:19.985
the stories of how my seeming failures
were really just weird-ass portals

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:21.531
to something beautiful.

00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:25.761
All I had to do
was give voice to the story.

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:31.798
There's a myth in most cultures
about following your dreams.

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:34.385
It's called the hero's journey.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:37.503
But I prefer a different myth,

00:11:37.527 --> 00:11:39.306
that's slightly to the side of that

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.487
or underneath it.

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:42.941
It's called the misfit's myth.

00:11:43.763 --> 00:11:45.028
And it goes like this:

00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:47.878
even at the moment of your failure,

00:11:47.902 --> 00:11:50.480
right then, you are beautiful.

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:52.737
You don't know it yet,

00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:55.938
but you have the ability
to reinvent yourself

00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:57.160
endlessly.

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:58.778
That's your beauty.

00:11:59.694 --> 00:12:01.210
You can be a drunk,

00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:03.583
you can be a survivor of abuse,

00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:05.043
you can be an ex-con,

00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:06.565
you can be a homeless person,

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:09.867
you can lose all your money
or your job or your husband

00:12:09.891 --> 00:12:12.305
or your wife, or the worst thing of all,

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:13.479
a child.

00:12:13.864 --> 00:12:15.917
You can even lose your marbles.

00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.010
You can be standing dead center
in the middle of your failure

00:12:20.034 --> 00:12:22.912
and still, I'm only here to tell you,

00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:25.049
you are so beautiful.

00:12:25.073 --> 00:12:27.372
Your story deserves to be heard,

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:31.669
because you, you rare
and phenomenal misfit,

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:33.949
you new species,

00:12:34.568 --> 00:12:36.537
are the only one in the room

00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:38.177
who can tell the story

00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:40.609
the way only you would.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.220
And I'd be listening.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.039
Thank you.

00:12:46.063 --> 00:12:57.423
(Applause)
