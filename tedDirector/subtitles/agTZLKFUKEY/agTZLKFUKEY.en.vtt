00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:18.567
So in the oasis of 
intelligentsia that is TED,

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:21.285
I stand here before you this evening

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:27.159
as an expert in dragging heavy
stuff around cold places.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.145
I've been leading polar expeditions 
for most of my adult life,

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.827
and last month, my teammate 
Tarka L'Herpiniere and I

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:39.025
finished the most ambitious 
expedition I've ever attempted.

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.014
In fact, it feels like I've been
transported straight here

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:44.666
from four months in the middle of nowhere,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:49.754
mostly grunting and swearing, 
straight to the TED stage.

00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:53.935
So you can imagine that's a transition
that hasn't been entirely seamless.

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:55.815
One of the interesting side effects

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:58.403
seems to be that my short-term
memory is entirely shot.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:00.665
So I've had to write some notes

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:05.363
to avoid too much grunting and swearing
in the next 17 minutes.

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:08.211
This is the first talk I've given
about this expedition,

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:13.683
and while we weren't sequencing genomes
or building space telescopes,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.474
this is a story about giving everything
we had to achieve something

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.310
that hadn't been done before.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.455
So I hope in that you might 
find some food for thought.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:28.066
It was a journey, an 
expedition in Antarctica,

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.743
the coldest, windiest, driest and
highest altitude continent on Earth.

00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:34.804
It's a fascinating place.
It's a huge place.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:37.119
It's twice the size of Australia,

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.211
a continent that is the same size
as China and India put together.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.088
As an aside, I have experienced 

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:46.312
an interesting phenomenon
in the last few days,

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:50.087
something that I expect Chris Hadfield
may get at TED in a few years' time,

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:52.144
conversations that go something like this:

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.767
"Oh, Antarctica. Awesome.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:59.604
My husband and I did Antarctica
with Lindblad for our anniversary."

00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:02.951
Or, "Oh cool, did you go there
for the marathon?"

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.060
(Laughter)

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:10.482
Our journey was, in fact,
69 marathons back to back

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:16.476
in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip
on foot from the coast of Antarctica

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:19.247
to the South Pole and back again.

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:21.491
In the process, we broke the record

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:27.084
for the longest human-powered polar
journey in history by more than 400 miles.

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:31.498
(Applause)

00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:33.913
For those of you from the Bay Area,

00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:38.030
it was the same as walking from 
here to San Francisco,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.908
then turning around
and walking back again.

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:45.827
So as camping trips go, it was a long one,

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:48.994
and one I've seen summarized 
most succinctly here

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:52.720
on the hallowed pages 
of Business Insider Malaysia.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.246
["Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition 
That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted"]

00:02:58.247 --> 00:03:00.917
Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:06.139
about fear and about the odds of success,
and indeed the odds of survival.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.014
Of the nine people in history that had
attempted this journey before us,

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.712
none had made it to the pole and back,

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.590
and five had died in the process.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.237
This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:22.000
He led the last team
to attempt this expedition.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.438
Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.154
over the space of a decade,

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:31.414
both led expeditions battling to become
the first to reach the South Pole,

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:34.446
to chart and map
the interior of Antarctica,

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.581
a place we knew less about, at the time,

00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:38.485
than the surface of the moon,

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.830
because we could see
the moon through telescopes.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.964
Antarctica was, for the most part,
a century ago, uncharted.

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:46.475
Some of you may know the story.

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:49.288
Scott's last expedition, the 
Terra Nova Expedition in 1910,

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:51.802
started as a giant
siege-style approach.

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:54.031
He had a big team using ponies,

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.778
using dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,

00:03:56.778 --> 00:04:00.175
dropping multiple, pre-positioned
depots of food and fuel

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:03.883
through which Scott's final team of five
would travel to the Pole,

00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:07.187
where they would turn around and ski 
back to the coast again on foot.

00:04:07.187 --> 00:04:09.599
Scott and his final team of five

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.284
arrived at the South Pole 
in January 1912

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:18.274
to find they had been beaten to it
by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:19.908
who rode on dogsled.

00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:21.997
Scott's team ended up on foot.

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:26.595
And for more than a century
this journey has remained unfinished.

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:29.520
Scott's team of five died 
on the return journey.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.633
And for the last decade,

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:34.954
I've been asking myself why that is.

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:38.246
How come this has remained 
the high-water mark?

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:40.596
Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.497
No one's come close to that ever since.

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:45.318
So this is the high-water mark 
of human endurance,

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.839
human endeavor, 
human athletic achievement

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.510
in arguably the harshest climate on Earth.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.018
It was as if the marathon record

00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:56.037
has remained unbroken since 1912.

00:04:56.037 --> 00:05:01.141
And of course some strange and 
predictable combination of curiosity,

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:03.095
stubbornness, and probably hubris

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:07.165
led me to thinking I might be the man
to try to finish the job.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:10.873
Unlike Scott's expedition,
there were just two of us,

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.996
and we set off from the coast
of Antarctica in October last year,

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:16.214
dragging everything ourselves,

00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:18.814
a process Scott called "man-hauling."

00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:21.837
When I say it was like walking from
here to San Francisco and back,

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:25.214
I actually mean it was like dragging
something that weighs a shade more

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:27.638
than the heaviest ever NFL player.

00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:29.681
Our sledges weighed 200 kilos,

00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.746
or 440 pounds each at the start,

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:37.020
the same weights that the weakest
of Scott's ponies pulled.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.200
Early on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.887
Perhaps the reason no one had 
attempted this journey until now,

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:45.145
in more than a century,

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:50.418
was that no one had been quite
stupid enough to try.

00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:52.437
And while I can't claim we were exploring

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:55.454
in the genuine Edwardian
sense of the word —

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:59.192
we weren't naming any mountains
or mapping any uncharted valleys —

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:03.573
I think we were stepping into uncharted
territory in a human sense.

00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.962
Certainly, if in the future we learn
there is an area of the human brain

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:10.779
that lights up when one curses oneself,

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.945
I won't be at all surprised.

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:17.997
You've heard that the average American
spends 90 percent of their time indoors.

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:21.253
We didn't go indoors
for nearly four months.

00:06:21.253 --> 00:06:23.495
We didn't see a sunset either.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.151
It was 24-hour daylight.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.306
Living conditions were quite spartan.

00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:32.148
I changed my underwear 
three times in 105 days

00:06:32.148 --> 00:06:36.072
and Tarka and I shared 
30 square feet on the canvas.

00:06:36.072 --> 00:06:40.813
Though we did have some technology
that Scott could never have imagined.

00:06:40.813 --> 00:06:44.180
And we blogged live every evening
from the tent via a laptop

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.225
and a custom-made satellite transmitter,

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:48.085
all of which were solar-powered:

00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:50.482
we had a flexible photovoltaic
panel over the tent.

00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:53.940
And the writing was important to me.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.493
As a kid, I was inspired by the 
literature of adventure and exploration,

00:07:00.493 --> 00:07:03.014
and I think we've all seen
here this week

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:07.265
the importance and 
the power of storytelling.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:09.081
So we had some 21st-century gear,

00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.868
but the reality is that the 
challenges that Scott faced

00:07:11.868 --> 00:07:13.865
were the same that we faced:

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:17.602
those of the weather and of 
what Scott called glide,

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:20.951
the amount of friction between
the sledges and the snow.

00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:24.799
The lowest wind chill 
we experienced was in the -70s,

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.378
and we had zero visibility,
what's called white-out,

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:30.391
for much of our journey.

00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:32.742
We traveled up and down one of the largest

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:35.955
and most dangerous glaciers
in the world, the Beardmore glacier.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.381
It's 110 miles long; most of its surface
is what's called blue ice.

00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.979
You can see it's a beautiful, 
shimmering steel-hard blue surface

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.817
covered with thousands 
and thousands of crevasses,

00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:50.798
these deep cracks in the glacial ice 
up to 200 feet deep.

00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:52.315
Planes can't land here,

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:55.775
so we were at the most risk,

00:07:55.775 --> 00:08:00.219
technically, when we had the slimmest
chance of being rescued.

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:04.115
We got to the South Pole
after 61 days on foot,

00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:06.694
with one day off for bad weather,

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.261
and I'm sad to say, it was
something of an anticlimax.

00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.726
There's a permanent American base,

00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:15.044
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
at the South Pole.

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:16.995
They have an airstrip,
they have a canteen,

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.448
they have hot showers,

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.353
they have a post office, a tourist shop,

00:08:20.353 --> 00:08:24.091
a basketball court that doubles
as a movie theater.

00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:26.066
So it's a bit different these days,

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:27.862
and there are also acres of junk.

00:08:27.862 --> 00:08:29.292
I think it's a marvelous thing

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:34.576
that humans can exist
365 days of the year

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:38.131
with hamburgers and hot showers
and movie theaters,

00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:40.887
but it does seem to produce
a lot of empty cardboard boxes.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.949
You can see on the left of 
this photograph,

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:44.384
several square acres of junk

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:46.897
waiting to be flown out
from the South Pole.

00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:50.929
But there is also a pole at the South Pole,

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:54.325
and we got there on foot, unassisted,

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.971
unsupported, by the hardest route,

00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:58.316
900 miles in record time,

00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:00.364
dragging more weight
than anyone in history.

00:09:00.364 --> 00:09:02.333
And if we'd stopped there 
and flown home,

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.467
which would have been
the eminently sensible thing to do,

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:07.348
then my talk would end here

00:09:07.348 --> 00:09:10.938
and it would end something like this.

00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:15.743
If you have the right team around you,
the right tools, the right technology,

00:09:15.743 --> 00:09:19.481
and if you have enough self-belief
and enough determination,

00:09:19.481 --> 00:09:22.926
then anything is possible.

00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:27.289
But then we turned around,

00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:30.048
and this is where things get interesting.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:32.842
High on the Antarctic plateau,

00:09:32.842 --> 00:09:36.841
over 10,000 feet, it's very windy,
very cold, very dry, we were exhausted.

00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:38.711
We'd covered 35 marathons,

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.297
we were only halfway,

00:09:40.297 --> 00:09:42.328
and we had a safety net, of course,

00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:44.452
of ski planes and satellite phones

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:48.505
and live, 24-hour tracking beacons
that didn't exist for Scott,

00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:50.257
but in hindsight,

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.323
rather than making our lives easier,

00:09:52.323 --> 00:09:54.482
the safety net actually allowed us

00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:58.337
to cut things very fine indeed,

00:09:58.337 --> 00:10:02.104
to sail very close to our absolute
limits as human beings.

00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:05.577
And it is an exquisite form of torture

00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:08.414
to exhaust yourself to the point
of starvation day after day

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:12.676
while dragging a sledge
full of food.

00:10:12.686 --> 00:10:16.613
For years, I'd been writing glib lines
in sponsorship proposals

00:10:16.613 --> 00:10:19.724
about pushing the limits
of human endurance,

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:24.136
but in reality, that was 
a very frightening place to be indeed.

00:10:24.136 --> 00:10:26.045
We had, before we'd got to the Pole,

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:29.509
two weeks of almost permanent
headwind, which slowed us down.

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.159
As a result, we'd had several days
of eating half rations.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:34.878
We had a finite amount of food
in the sledges to make this journey,

00:10:34.878 --> 00:10:36.880
so we were trying to string that out

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.793
by reducing our intake to half 
the calories we should have been eating.

00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:44.412
As a result, we both became
increasingly hypoglycemic —

00:10:44.412 --> 00:10:47.236
we had low blood sugar 
levels day after day —

00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:51.994
and increasingly susceptible
to the extreme cold.

00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:54.097
Tarka took this photo of me one evening

00:10:54.097 --> 00:10:56.227
after I'd nearly passed out
with hypothermia.

00:10:56.227 --> 00:11:01.035
We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia,
something I hadn't experienced before,

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.746
and it was very humbling indeed.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.414
As much as you might
like to think, as I do,

00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:08.670
that you're the kind
of person who doesn't quit,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.664
that you'll go down swinging,

00:11:10.664 --> 00:11:12.916
hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.

00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:15.726
You become utterly incapacitated.

00:11:15.726 --> 00:11:18.907
It's like being a drunk toddler.

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:20.880
You become pathetic.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.999
I remember just wanting
to lie down and quit.

00:11:24.999 --> 00:11:27.173
It was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,

00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:32.412
and a real surprise to me
to be debilitated to that degree.

00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:36.894
And then we ran out of food completely,

00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:40.352
46 miles short of the first of the depots

00:11:40.352 --> 00:11:42.217
that we'd laid on our outward journey.

00:11:42.217 --> 00:11:43.560
We'd laid 10 depots of food,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.277
literally burying food and fuel,
for our return journey —

00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:49.554
the fuel was for a cooker so you
could melt snow to get water —

00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:55.361
and I was forced to make the decision
to call for a resupply flight,

00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:59.930
a ski plane carrying eight days of food
to tide us over that gap.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.289
They took 12 hours to reach us
from the other side of Antarctica.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.998
Calling for that plane was one of 
the toughest decisions of my life.

00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:10.474
And I sound like a bit of a fraud
standing here now with a sort of belly.

00:12:10.474 --> 00:12:13.314
I've put on 30 pounds
in the last three weeks.

00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:16.389
Being that hungry has left
an interesting mental scar,

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:20.996
which is that I've been hoovering up
every hotel buffet that I can find.

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:22.774
(Laughter)

00:12:22.774 --> 00:12:28.468
But we were genuinely quite hungry,
and in quite a bad way.

00:12:28.468 --> 00:12:30.909
I don't regret calling
for that plane for a second,

00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:32.911
because I'm still standing here alive,

00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:34.971
with all digits intact, 
telling this story.

00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:39.709
But getting external assistance like that
was never part of the plan,

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:42.913
and it's something my ego
is still struggling with.

00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:45.955
This was the biggest dream I've ever had,

00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:48.047
and it was so nearly perfect.

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.648
On the way back down to the coast,

00:12:50.648 --> 00:12:52.839
our crampons — they're 
the spikes on our boots

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:55.765
that we have for traveling
over this blue ice on the glacier —

00:12:55.765 --> 00:12:57.420
broke on the top of the Beardmore.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.185
We still had 100 miles to go downhill

00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:01.419
on very slippery rock-hard blue ice.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.810
They needed repairing almost every hour.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.761
To give you an idea of scale,

00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:08.758
this is looking down towards the mouth
of the Beardmore Glacier.

00:13:08.758 --> 00:13:12.233
You could fit the entirety of Manhattan
in the gap on the horizon.

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:15.447
That's 20 miles between
Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin.

00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:21.680
I've never felt as small 
as I did in Antarctica.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.785
When we got down
to the mouth of the glacier,

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:28.431
we found fresh snow had obscured
the dozens of deep crevasses.

00:13:28.431 --> 00:13:31.381
One of Shackleton's men described
crossing this sort of terrain

00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:36.375
as like walking over the glass roof
of a railway station.

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:39.289
We fell through more times
than I can remember,

00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:42.721
usually just putting a ski
or a boot through the snow.

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:45.324
Occasionally we went in all 
the way up to our armpits,

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:48.767
but thankfully never deeper than that.

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:52.947
And less than five weeks ago,
after 105 days,

00:13:52.947 --> 00:13:56.522
we crossed this oddly 
inauspicious finish line,

00:13:56.522 --> 00:13:59.544
the coast of Ross Island 
on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.

00:13:59.544 --> 00:14:01.694
You can see the ice in the foreground

00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:04.556
and the sort of rubbly rock behind that.

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:08.358
Behind us lay an unbroken 
ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:10.866
We'd made the longest ever
polar journey on foot,

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:15.256
something I'd been dreaming 
of doing for a decade.

00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:17.271
And looking back,

00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:19.666
I still stand by all the things

00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:21.248
I've been saying for years

00:14:21.248 --> 00:14:23.367
about the importance of goals

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:26.809
and determination and self-belief,

00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:31.520
but I'll also admit that I hadn't given
much thought to what happens

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.432
when you reach the all-consuming goal

00:14:35.432 --> 00:14:38.750
that you've dedicated 
most of your adult life to,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.330
and the reality is that I'm 
still figuring that bit out.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.931
As I said, there are very few
superficial signs that I've been away.

00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:47.382
I've put on 30 pounds.

00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:50.910
I've got some very faint, probably 
covered in makeup now, frostbite scars.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.383
I've got one on my nose, one on 
each cheek, from where the goggles are,

00:14:54.383 --> 00:14:59.128
but inside I am a very 
different person indeed.

00:14:59.128 --> 00:15:01.625
If I'm honest,

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:06.800
Antarctica challenged me
and humbled me so deeply

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.503
that I'm not sure I'll ever be able
to put it into words.

00:15:10.503 --> 00:15:14.603
I'm still struggling to piece
together my thoughts.

00:15:14.603 --> 00:15:18.248
That I'm standing here 
telling this story

00:15:18.248 --> 00:15:23.026
is proof that we all can 
accomplish great things,

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:25.180
through ambition, through passion,

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.342
through sheer stubbornness,

00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:28.857
by refusing to quit,

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.813
that if you dream something 
hard enough, as Sting said,

00:15:31.813 --> 00:15:34.884
it does indeed come to pass.

00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:38.230
But I'm also standing here 
saying, you know what,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:44.211
that cliche about the journey being 
more important than the destination?

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:47.532
There's something in that.

00:15:47.532 --> 00:15:49.901
The closer I got to my finish line,

00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.657
that rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island,

00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:56.851
the more I started to realize
that the biggest lesson

00:15:56.851 --> 00:16:01.431
that this very long, very hard walk
might be teaching me

00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:05.124
is that happiness is not
a finish line,

00:16:05.124 --> 00:16:06.694
that for us humans,

00:16:06.694 --> 00:16:10.170
the perfection that so many of
us seem to dream of

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.250
might not ever be truly attainable,

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:22.716
and that if we can't feel content
here, today, now, on our journeys

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:27.184
amidst the mess and the striving
that we all inhabit,

00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:29.904
the open loops, 
the half-finished to-do lists,

00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:32.756
the could-do-better-next-times,

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:36.055
then we might never feel it.

00:16:36.055 --> 00:16:39.631
A lot of people have asked me, what next?

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:46.629
Right now, I am very happy just recovering
and in front of hotel buffets.

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:50.982
But as Bob Hope put it,

00:16:50.982 --> 00:16:53.278
I feel very humble,

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:57.347
but I think I have the strength
of character to fight it. (Laughter)

00:16:57.347 --> 00:16:59.297
Thank you.

00:16:59.297 --> 00:17:02.975
(Applause)
