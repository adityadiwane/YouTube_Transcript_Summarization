00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.836
I'm a neuroscientist,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.156
and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.036
and our mission is to train
the next generation of neuroscientists

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.076
by taking graduate-level
neuroscience research equipment

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.540
and making it available for kids
in middle schools and high schools.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.196
And so when we go into the classroom,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.116
one way to get them thinking
about the brain, which is very complex,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.076
is to ask them a very simple
question about neuroscience,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.140
and that is, "What has a brain?"

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.116
When we ask that,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.195
students will instantly tell you
that their cat or dog has a brain,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.796
and most will say that a mouse
or even a small insect has a brain,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.636
but almost nobody says
that a plant or a tree

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.836
or a shrub has a brain.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.356
And so when you push --

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.956
because this could actually
help describe a little bit

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.156
how the brain actually functions --

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.396
so you push and say,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.956
"Well, what is it that makes
living things have brains versus not?"

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.436
And often they'll come back
with the classification

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.236
that things that move tend to have brains.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.876
And that's absolutely correct.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.356
Our nervous system evolved
because it is electrical.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.516
It's fast, so we can quickly respond
to stimuli in the world

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.756
and move if we need to.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.996
But you can go back
and push back on a student,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.076
and say, "Well, you know,
you say that plants don't have brains,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.556
but plants do move."

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.436
Anyone who has grown a plant

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.436
has noticed that the plant will move

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.276
and face the sun.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.436
But they'll say,
"But that's a slow movement.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.476
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process."

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.876
But what about fast-moving plants?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.996
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,
the Royal Governor of North Carolina,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.556
made a pretty fascinating discovery.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.436
In the swamps behind his house,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.116
he found a plant that would spring shut

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.820
every time a bug would fall in between it.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.476
He called this plant the flytrap,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.436
and within a decade,
it made its way over to Europe,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.996
where eventually the great Charles Darwin
got to study this plant,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.036
and this plant absolutely blew him away.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.596
He called it the most wonderful
plant in the world.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.876
This is a plant
that was an evolutionary wonder.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.876
This is a plant that moves quickly,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.196
which is rare,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.196
and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.676
And this is in the same plant.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.156
But I'm here today to tell you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.596
that's not even the coolest thing
about this plant.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.140
The coolest thing
is that the plant can count.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.756
So in order to show that,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.956
we have to get some vocabulary
out of the way.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.236
So I'm going to do what we do
in the classroom with students.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.116
We're going to do
an experiment on electrophysiology,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.276
which is the recording
of the body's electrical signal,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.596
either coming from neurons
or from muscles.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.956
And I'm putting some electrodes
here on my wrists.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.316
As I hook them up,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.516
we're going to be able to see a signal

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.996
on the screen here.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.916
And this signal may be familiar to you.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.116
It's called the EKG,
or the electrocardiogram.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.596
And this is coming
from neurons in my heart

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.156
that are firing
what's called action potentials,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.036
potential meaning voltage and action
meaning it moves quickly up and down,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.516
which causes my heart to fire,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.356
which then causes
the signal that you see here.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.116
And so I want you to remember the shape
of what we'll be looking at right here,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.996
because this is going to be important.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.436
This is a way that the brain
encodes information

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.156
in the form of an action potential.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.500
So now let's turn to some plants.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.276
So I'm going to first
introduce you to the mimosa,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.516
not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.876
and this is a plant that's found
in Central America and South America,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.876
and it has behaviors.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.996
And the first behavior
I'm going to show you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.116
is if I touch the leaves here,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.340
you get to see that the leaves
tend to curl up.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.356
And then the second behavior is,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.556
if I tap the leaf,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.396
the entire branch seems to fall down.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.956
So why does it do that?

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.596
It's not really known to science.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.836
One of the reasons why
could be that it scares away insects

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.036
or it looks less appealing to herbivores.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.556
But how does it do that?
Now, that's interesting.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.716
We can do an experiment to find out.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.196
So what we're going to do now,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.636
just like I recorded
the electrical potential from my body,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.476
we're going to record the electrical
potential from this plant, this mimosa.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.996
And so what we're going to do
is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.100
and I've got the ground electrode where?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.116
In the ground. It's an electrical
engineering joke. Alright.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.476
(Laughter)

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.236
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead
and tap the leaf here,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.635
and I want you to look
at the electrical recording

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.620
that we're going to see inside the plant.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.236
Whoa. It is so big,
I've got to scale it down.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.676
Alright. So what is that?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.676
That is an action potential
that is happening inside the plant.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.956
Why was it happening?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.596
Because it wanted to move. Right?

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.636
And so when I hit the touch receptors,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.836
it sent a voltage all the way down
to the end of the stem,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.116
which caused it to move.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.396
And now, in our arms,
we would move our muscles,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.116
but the plant doesn't have muscles.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.396
What it has is water inside the cells

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.356
and when the voltage hits it,
it opens up, releases the water,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.814
changes the shape of the cells,
and the leaf falls.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.236
OK. So here we see an action potential
encoding information to move. Alright?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.756
But can it do more?

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.036
So let's go to find out.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.116
We're going to go to our good friend,
the Venus flytrap here,

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.556
and we're going to take a look
at what happens inside the leaf

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.516
when a fly lands on here.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.236
So I'm going to pretend
to be a fly right now.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.916
And now here's my Venus flytrap,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.956
and inside the leaf,
you're going to notice

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.196
that there are three little hairs here,
and those are trigger hairs.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.596
And so when a fly lands --

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.116
I'm going to touch
one of the hairs right now.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.580
Ready? One, two, three.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.276
What do we get? We get
a beautiful action potential.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.820
However, the flytrap doesn't close.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.916
And to understand why that is,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.156
we need to know a little bit more
about the behavior of the flytrap.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.476
Number one is that it takes
a long time to open the traps back up --

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.676
you know, about 24 to 48 hours
if there's no fly inside of it.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.396
And so it takes a lot of energy.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.636
And two, it doesn't need to eat
that many flies throughout the year.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.316
Only a handful. It gets
most of its energy from the sun.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.556
It's just trying to replace
some nutrients in the ground with flies.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.836
And the third thing is,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.836
it only opens then closes the traps
a handful of times

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.500
until that trap dies.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.636
So therefore, it wants
to make really darn sure

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.076
that there's a meal inside of it
before the flytrap snaps shut.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.300
So how does it do that?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.716
It counts the number of seconds

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.956
between successive
touching of those hairs.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.396
And so the idea is
that there's a high probability,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.876
if there's a fly inside of there,
that it's going to be clicked together,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.116
and so when it gets the first
action potential,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.556
it starts counting, one, two,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.796
and if it gets to 20
and it doesn't fire again,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.236
then it's not going to close,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.116
but if it does it within there,
then the flytrap will close.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.596
So we're going to go back now.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.636
I'm going to touch
the Venus flytrap again.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.676
I've been talking
for more than 20 seconds.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.660
So we can see what happens
when I touch the hair a second time.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.996
So what do we get?
We get a second action potential,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.916
but again, the leaf doesn't close.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.876
So now if I go back in there

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.796
and if I'm a fly moving around,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.996
I'm going to be touching
the leaf a few times.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.436
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.876
And immediately,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.636
the flytrap closes.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.796
So here we are seeing the flytrap
actually doing a computation.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.316
It's determining
if there's a fly inside the trap,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.836
and then it closes.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.260
So let's go back to our original question.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.636
Do plants have brains?

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.236
Well, the answer is no.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.636
There's no brains in here.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.236
There's no axons, no neurons.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.636
It doesn't get depressed.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.036
It doesn't want to know
what the Tigers' score is.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.156
It doesn't have
self-actualization problems.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.596
But what it does have
is something that's very similar to us,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.676
which is the ability
to communicate using electricity.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.956
It just uses slightly
different ions than we do,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.996
but it's actually doing the same thing.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.196
So just to show you

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.516
the ubiquitous nature
of these action potentials,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.756
we saw it in the Venus flytrap,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.916
we've seen an action
potential in the mimosa.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.316
We've even seen
an action potential in a human.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.556
Now, this is the euro of the brain.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.716
It's the way that all
information is passed.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.556
And so what we can do
is we can use those action potentials

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.076
to pass information

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.836
between species of plants.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.276
And so this is our interspecies
plant-to-plant communicator,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.476
and what we've done
is we've created a brand new experiment

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.036
where we're going to record
the action potential from a Venus flytrap,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.836
and we're going to send it
into the sensitive mimosa.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.596
So I want you to recall what happens

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.556
when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.236
It has touch receptors
that are sending that information

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.356
back down in the form
of an action potential.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.716
And so what would happen

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.356
if we took the action potential
from the Venus flytrap

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.460
and sent it into
all the stems of the mimosa?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.276
We should be able to create
the behavior of the mimosas

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.196
without actually touching it ourselves.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.236
And so if you'll allow me,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.715
I'm going to go ahead
and trigger this mimosa right now

00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:58.556
by touching on the hairs
of the Venus flytrap.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.180
So we're going to send information
about touch from one plant to another.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.156
So there you see it.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.396
So --

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:15.436
(Applause)

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.516
So I hope you learned a little bit,
something about plants today,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.756
and not only that.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.796
You learned that plants could be used
to help teach neuroscience

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.556
and bring along the neurorevolution.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.796
Thank you.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.540
(Applause)
