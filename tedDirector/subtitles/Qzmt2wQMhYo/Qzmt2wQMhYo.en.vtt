00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:18.036
About 75 years ago,

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:20.595
my grandfather, a young man,

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.506
walked into a tent

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.003
that was converted into a

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.714
movie theater like that,

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.914
and he fell hopelessly in love

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:29.243
with the woman he saw on the

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:32.572
silver screen: none other than Mae West,

00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.487
the heartthrob of the '30s,

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:36.527
and he could never forget her.

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:38.447
In fact, when he had his daughter

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.639
many years later, he wanted to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.055
name her after Mae West,

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:43.639
but can you imagine an Indian

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.175
child name Mae West?

00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:46.861
The Indian family said, no way!

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.799
So when my twin brother Kaesava

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.309
was born, he decided to tinker

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.024
with the spelling of Keshava's name.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:57.735
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:01.271
why can't Keshava be K-A-E?

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.511
So he changed Kaesava's spelling.

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.582
Now Kaesava had a baby boy

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:07.782
called Rehan a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:10.013
He decided to spell, or, rather,

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:12.093
misspell Raehan with an A-E.

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:14.228
You know, my grandfather died

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:15.588
many years ago when I was

00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:17.429
little, but his love for Mae

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.900
West lives on as a misspelling

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.676
in the DNA of his progeny.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:24.820
That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.462
You know, as for me,

00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:27.689
my wife and I have our own

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.297
crazy legacy project.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.489
We actually sit every few years,

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.862
argue, disagree, fight,

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.704
and actually come up with our

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:37.720
very own 200-year plan.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.680
Our friends think we're mad.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.168
Our parents think we're cuckoo.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.504
Because, you know, we both

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:43.872
come from families that really

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.873
look up to humility and wisdom,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.504
but we both like to live

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:49.841
larger than life.

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:51.351
I believe in the concept of

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.112
a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.425
you can become an ascetic.

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:56.920
This is me being a rock star,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.544
even if it's in my own house.

00:01:58.544 --> 00:01:59.808
You know?

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:01.520
So when Netra and I sat down

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.976
to make our first plan

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.960
10 years ago, we said

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.064
we want the focus of this plan

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:08.880
to go way beyond ourselves.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.544
What do we mean by beyond ourselves?

00:02:11.544 --> 00:02:14.569
Well 200 years, we calculated,

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.744
is at the end of our direct

00:02:16.744 --> 00:02:17.912
contact with the world.

00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:19.271
There's nobody I'll meet in

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.584
my life will ever live beyond

00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:23.488
200 years, so we thought

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:24.680
that's a perfect place where

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.592
we should situate our plan and

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:28.320
let our imagination take flight.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.864
You know, I never really

00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:31.552
believed in legacy. What am I

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.544
going to leave behind? I'm an artist.

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:36.830
Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.478
It caused so much trouble for me.

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:40.894
I was so upset.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.374
You know, a cartoon that was

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:45.038
meant to be a cartoon of the week

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:48.270
ended up staying so much longer.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.424
Now I'm in the business of

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.101
creating art that will

00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:54.464
definitely even outlive me, and

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:56.125
I think about what I want to

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.165
leave behind through those paintings.

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.157
You know, the 9/11 cartoon

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:03.453
upset me so much that I decided

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:04.989
I'll never cartoon again.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.205
I said, I'm never going to make any

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.118
honest public commentary again.

00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:10.613
But of course I continued

00:03:10.613 --> 00:03:12.549
creating artwork that was honest

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.726
and raw, because I forgot about

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:16.944
how people reacted to my work.

00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:18.518
You know, sometimes forgetting

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:21.509
is so important to remain idealistic.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.246
Perhaps loss of memory is so

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.189
crucial for our survival

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.558
as human beings.

00:03:27.558 --> 00:03:29.413
One of the most important things

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:31.317
in my 200-year plan that Netra

00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:33.703
and I write is what to forget

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:35.016
about ourselves.

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:36.437
You know, we carry so much

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:37.846
baggage, from our parents,

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:39.854
from our society, from so many

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:43.598
people -- fears, insecurities -- and

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.453
our 200-year plan really lists

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:48.505
all our childhood problems that we have to expire.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:50.006
We actually put an expiry date

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:52.480
on all our childhood problems.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.345
The latest date I put was,

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:57.106
I said, I am going to expire

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:59.649
my fear of my leftist, feminist

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.058
mother-in-law, and this

00:04:02.058 --> 00:04:05.180
today is the date! (Laughs)

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.771
She's watching. (Laughter)

00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:11.619
Anyway, you know, I really

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.619
make decisions all the time

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.204
about how I want to remember

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:18.476
myself, and that's the most important

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:19.995
kind of decisions I make.

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.867
And this directly translates

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:23.190
into my paintings.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.332
But like my friends, I can do

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.908
that really well on Facebook,

00:04:26.908 --> 00:04:28.827
Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.

00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:30.260
Name it, I'm on it.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.339
I've started outsourcing my

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.932
memory to the digital world,

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:35.372
you know? But that comes

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:36.468
with a problem.

00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:38.099
It's so easy to think of

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.404
technology as a metaphor

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.750
for memory, but our brains

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.697
are not perfect storage devices

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:44.496
like technology.

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.036
We only remember what we

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.291
want to. At least I do.

00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.794
And I rather think of our brains

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:52.193
as biased curators of our

00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:55.033
memory, you know? And if

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:56.857
technology is not a metaphor for

00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:58.489
memory, what is it?

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:01.505
Netra and I use our technology

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:04.073
as a tool in our 200-year plan

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:07.592
to really curate our digital legacy.

00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:10.609
That is a picture of my mother,

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.362
and she recently got a Facebook account.

00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:15.128
You know where this is going.

00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:16.962
And I've been very supportive

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:19.345
until this picture shows up

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:20.912
on my Facebook page. (Laughter)

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:24.169
And I actually untagged myself

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.633
first, then I picked up the

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.992
phone. I said, "Mom, you will

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.104
never put a picture of me

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:29.393
in a bikini ever again."

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:32.321
And she said, "Why? You look

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.440
so cute, darling." I said,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.233
"You just don't understand."

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:38.216
Maybe we are among the first

00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:39.537
generation that really understands

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:41.728
this digital curating of ourselves.

00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:43.290
Maybe we are the first to even

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.528
actively record our lives.

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.080
You know, whether you

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.233
agree with, you know, legacy

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.376
or not, we are actually leaving

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.729
behind digital traces all the time.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.784
So Netra and I really wanted

00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:57.144
to use our 200-year plan

00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:59.321
to curate this digital legacy,

00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:01.160
and not only digital legacy

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.320
but we believe in curating

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.208
the legacy of my past

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:05.392
and future.

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:07.225
How, you may ask?

00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:10.793
Well, when I think of the future,

00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:12.985
I never see myself moving forward

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.017
in time. I actually see time

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:17.089
moving backward towards me.

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:18.489
I can actually visualize

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:19.840
my future approaching.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.953
I can dodge what I don't want

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:23.441
and pull in what I want.

00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:24.752
It's like a video game obstacle

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:27.238
course. And I've gotten better and better

00:06:27.238 --> 00:06:29.071
at doing this. Even when I make

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:31.104
a painting, I actually imagine

00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:33.135
I'm behind the painting,

00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:34.318
it already exists, and

00:06:34.318 --> 00:06:35.534
someone's looking at it,

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:36.624
and I see whether they're

00:06:36.624 --> 00:06:38.245
feeling it from their gut.

00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:39.478
Are they feeling it from their

00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:42.144
heart, or is it just a cerebral thing?

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:44.252
And it really informs my painting.

00:06:44.252 --> 00:06:45.443
Even when I do an art show,

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:46.467
I really think about, what should

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:48.019
people walk away with?

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.955
I remember when I was 19,

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:53.092
I did, I wanted to do my first

00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:56.292
art exhibition, and I wanted the

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:57.699
whole world to know about it.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.147
I didn't know TED then,

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:01.148
but what I did was I closed

00:07:01.148 --> 00:07:02.916
my eyes tight, and I started

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:05.188
dreaming. I could imagine people

00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:06.731
coming in, dressed up, looking

00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:08.764
beautiful, my paintings with all

00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:11.475
the light, and in my visualization

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:13.331
I actually saw a very famous

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:15.499
actress launching my show,

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:16.996
giving credibility to me.

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:19.059
And I woke up from my

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:20.316
visualization and I said,

00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:22.052
who was that? I couldn't tell

00:07:22.052 --> 00:07:24.291
if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,

00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:26.500
two very famous Indian actresses,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.347
like the Meryl Streeps of India.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:30.707
As it turned out, next morning

00:07:30.707 --> 00:07:32.427
I wrote a letter to both of them,

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:34.380
and Shabana Azmi replied,

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.147
and came and launched

00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:39.212
my very first show 12 years ago.

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.444
And what a bang it started

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:43.244
my career with! You know,

00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:45.660
when we think of time in this

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.979
way, we can curate not only the

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:51.496
future but also the past.

00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:53.700
This is a picture of my family,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.323
and that is Netra, my wife.

00:07:56.323 --> 00:07:57.955
She's the co-creator of my

00:07:57.955 --> 00:07:59.436
200-year plan.

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:01.475
Netra's a high school history

00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:03.419
teacher. I love Netra,

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:05.236
but I hate history.

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.148
I keep saying, "Nets, you live

00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:08.795
in the past while I'll create

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:10.796
the future, and when I'm done,

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:12.292
you can study about it."

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:14.252
(Laughter)

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:16.251
She gave me an indulgent smile,

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.388
and as punishment, she said,

00:08:18.388 --> 00:08:20.123
"Tomorrow I'm teaching a class

00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:22.284
on Indian history, and you are

00:08:22.284 --> 00:08:23.732
sitting in it, and I'm grading you."

00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:26.075
I'm like, "Oh, God." I went.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.379
I actually went and sat in

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:29.572
on her class. She started by

00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:31.867
giving students primary source

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:34.482
documents from India, Pakistan,

00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:36.731
from Britain, and I said,

00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:38.875
"Wow." Then she asked them to

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.827
separate fact from bias.

00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:43.619
I said, "Wow," again.

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:46.579
Then she said, "Choose your

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:49.883
facts and biases and create an

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:52.162
image of your own story

00:08:52.162 --> 00:08:53.571
of dignity."

00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:56.826
History as an imaging tool?

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:58.459
I was so inspired.

00:08:58.459 --> 00:08:59.819
I went and created my own

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:01.396
version of Indian history.

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:03.283
I actually included stories from

00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:04.305
my grandmother.

00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:05.464
She used to work for the

00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:07.032
telephone exchange, and she used

00:09:07.032 --> 00:09:08.159
to actually overhear conversations

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.328
between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:11.904
And she used to hear all

00:09:11.904 --> 00:09:13.039
kinds of things she shouldn't

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:15.545
have heard. But, you know,

00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:16.711
I include things like that.

00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.505
This is my version of Indian history.

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:23.791
You know, if this

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.905
is so, it occurred to me that

00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:28.128
maybe, just maybe, the primary

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:29.567
objective of our brains

00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:32.607
is to serve our dignity.

00:09:32.607 --> 00:09:34.615
Go tell Facebook to

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:35.924
figure that out!

00:09:35.924 --> 00:09:38.544
Netra and I don't write our

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.357
200-year plan for someone else

00:09:40.357 --> 00:09:41.381
to come and execute it

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.524
in 150 years. Imagine receiving

00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:45.421
a parcel saying, from the past,

00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:46.784
okay now you're supposed to

00:09:46.784 --> 00:09:47.749
spend the rest of your life

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:49.207
doing all of this. No.

00:09:49.207 --> 00:09:50.854
We actually write it only

00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:53.344
to set our attitudes right.

00:09:53.344 --> 00:09:57.184
You know, I used to believe

00:09:57.184 --> 00:09:58.584
that education is the most

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:00.065
important tool to leave

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.522
a meaningful legacy.

00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:03.046
Education is great.

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:04.695
It really teaches us who

00:10:04.695 --> 00:10:06.031
we are, and helps us

00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:07.350
contextualize ourselves

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.316
in the world, but it's really

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.375
my creativity that's taught me

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.152
that I can be much more

00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:15.343
than what my education told me I am.

00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:16.797
I'd like to make

00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:19.127
the argument that creativity is

00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:21.558
the most important tool we have.

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:23.744
It lets us create who we are,

00:10:23.744 --> 00:10:25.655
and curate what is to come.

00:10:25.655 --> 00:10:28.895
I like to think -- Thank you.

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.470
I like to think of myself

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.806
as a storyteller, where my past

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:35.870
and my future are only stories,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.159
my stories, waiting to be told

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.774
and retold. I hope all of you

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.718
one day get a chance to

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:44.545
share and write your own

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:45.910
200-year story.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.975
Thank you so much.

00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:49.158
Shukran! (Applause)
