00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:16.192
War has been a part of my life
since I can remember.

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:20.955
I was born in Afghanistan,
just six months after the Soviets invaded,

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:24.807
and even though I was too young
to understand what was happening,

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:28.152
I had a deep sense of the suffering
and the fear around me.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:34.341
Those early experiences had a major impact
on how I now think about war and conflict.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.487
I learned that when people
have a fundamental issue at stake,

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:39.763
for most of them,

00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:41.419
giving in is not an option.

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.583
For these types conflicts --

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:45.392
when people's rights are violated,

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:47.186
when their countries are occupied,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.428
when they're oppressed and humiliated --

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.610
they need a powerful way
to resist and to fight back.

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:57.571
Which means that no matter how destructive
and terrible violence is,

00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:00.019
if people see it as their only choice,

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:01.500
they will use it.

00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:05.650
Most of us are concerned
with the level of violence in the world.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.499
But we're not going to end war

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:10.231
by telling people
that violence is morally wrong.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.282
Instead, we must offer them a tool

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.645
that's at least as powerful
and as effective as violence.

00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:19.060
This is the work I do.

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:21.256
For the past 13 years,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.565
I've been teaching people

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.697
in some of the most difficult
situations around the world

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:29.088
how they can use nonviolent
struggle to conduct conflict.

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:34.803
Most people associate this type of action
with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:39.302
But people have been using
nonviolent action for thousands of years.

00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:44.163
In fact, most of the rights
that we have today in this country --

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.338
as women,

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:46.513
as minorities,

00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:47.885
as workers,

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.475
as people of different sexual orientations

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.957
and citizens concerned
with the environment --

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.838
these rights weren't handed to us.

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.386
They were won by people
who fought for them

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.232
and who sacrificed for them.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.776
But because we haven't learned
from this history,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.841
nonviolent struggle as a technique
is widely misunderstood.

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:09.610
I met recently with a group
of Ethiopian activists,

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:12.784
and they told me something
that I hear a lot.

00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:15.134
They said they'd already
tried nonviolent action,

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:16.576
and it hadn't worked.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.936
Years ago they held a protest.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.668
The government arrested everyone,
and that was the end of that.

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:27.262
The idea that nonviolent struggle
is equivalent to street protests

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:28.684
is a real problem.

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:33.604
Because although protests can be a great
way to show that people want change,

00:02:33.628 --> 00:02:36.498
on their own, they don't
actually create change --

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.490
at least change that is fundamental.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:39.702
(Laughter)

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.835
Powerful opponents are not going to give
people what they want

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.791
just because they asked nicely ...

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.396
or even not so nicely.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.553
(Laughter)

00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:51.621
Nonviolent struggle works
by destroying an opponent,

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:53.330
not physically,

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:57.764
but by identifying the institutions
that an opponent needs to survive,

00:02:57.788 --> 00:02:59.970
and then denying them
those sources of power.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.234
Nonviolent activists
can neutralize the military

00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:05.482
by causing soldiers to defect.

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:08.781
They can disrupt the economy
through strikes and boycotts.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.492
And they can challenge
government propaganda

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:13.382
by creating alternative media.

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.673
There are a variety of methods
that can be used to do this.

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:20.176
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.827
has identified 198 methods
of nonviolent action.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:27.951
And protest is only one.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:30.373
Let me give you a recent example.

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:32.354
Until a few months ago,

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:35.595
Guatemala was ruled
by corrupt former military officials

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.430
with ties to organized crime.

00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:39.864
People were generally aware of this,

00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:43.238
but most of them felt powerless
to do anything about it --

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:48.482
until one group of citizens,
just 12 regular people,

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:51.248
put out a call on Facebook
to their friends

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.511
to meet in the central plaza,
holding signs with a message:

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:56.431
"Renuncia YA" --

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:58.440
resign already.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.608
To their surprise,

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:02.392
30,000 people showed up.

00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:06.482
They stayed there for months
as protests spread throughout the country.

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:08.088
At one point,

00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:12.300
the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs
to various government buildings

00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:13.491
with a message:

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.846
"If you don't have the huevos" --

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.076
the balls --

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.154
"to stop corrupt candidates
from running for office,

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:21.636
you can borrow ours."

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.319
(Laughter)

00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:26.698
(Applause)

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:29.988
President Molina responded

00:04:30.012 --> 00:04:32.148
by vowing that he would never step down.

00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:36.275
And the activists realized
that they couldn't just keep protesting

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.313
and ask the president to resign.

00:04:38.337 --> 00:04:40.333
They needed to leave him no choice.

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:42.724
So they organized a general strike,

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:45.395
in which people throughout
the country refused to work.

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.821
In Guatemala City alone,

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:49.794
over 400 businesses
and schools shut their doors.

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:51.548
Meanwhile,

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:54.201
farmers throughout the country
blocked major roads.

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.703
Within five days,

00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:56.904
the president,

00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:59.651
along with dozens of other
government officials,

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.144
resigned already.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:05.451
(Applause)

00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:07.078
I've been greatly inspired

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:11.005
by the creativity and bravery
of people using nonviolent action

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.252
in nearly every country in the world.

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:14.869
For example,

00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:17.450
recently a group of activists in Uganda

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:19.607
released a crate of pigs in the streets.

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:23.534
You can see here that the police
are confused about what to do with them.

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:24.594
(Laughter)

00:05:24.618 --> 00:05:27.234
The pigs were painted
the color of the ruling party.

00:05:27.617 --> 00:05:29.895
One pig was even wearing a hat,

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.799
a hat that people recognized.

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.384
(Laughter)

00:05:34.264 --> 00:05:37.633
Activists around the world
are getting better at grabbing headlines,

00:05:37.657 --> 00:05:40.320
but these isolated actions do very little

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:42.527
if they're not part of a larger strategy.

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:45.153
A general wouldn't march
his troops into battle

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.308
unless he had a plan to win the war.

00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:50.443
Yet this is how most of the world's
nonviolent movements operate.

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:55.216
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex
as military warfare,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.438
if not more.

00:05:56.462 --> 00:06:00.657
Its participants must be well-trained
and have clear objectives,

00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.513
and its leaders must have a strategy
of how to achieve those objectives.

00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:08.508
The technique of war has been developed
over thousands of years

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:10.079
with massive resources

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:13.349
and some of our best minds
dedicated to understanding

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.098
and improving how it works.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:20.190
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle
is rarely systematically studied,

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.224
and even though the number is growing,

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:26.033
there are still only a few dozen people
in the world who are teaching it.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.142
This is dangerous,

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:32.334
because we now know that our old
approaches of dealing with conflict

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:35.776
are not adequate for the new
challenges that we're facing.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.883
The US government recently admitted

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.820
that it's in a stalemate
in its war against ISIS.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.062
But what most people don't know

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:46.600
is that people have stood up to ISIS
using nonviolent action.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.930
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:54.685
they announced that they were putting
in place a new public school curriculum,

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.839
based on their own extremist ideology.

00:06:57.556 --> 00:06:59.096
But on the first day of school,

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:01.358
not a single child showed up.

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:05.044
Parents simply refused to send them.

00:07:05.068 --> 00:07:08.260
They told journalists they would rather
homeschool their children

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:09.840
than to have them brainwashed.

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:13.698
This is an example
of just one act of defiance

00:07:13.722 --> 00:07:15.077
in just one city.

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.104
But what if it was coordinated

00:07:17.128 --> 00:07:19.750
with the dozens of other acts
of nonviolent resistance

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.829
that have taken place against ISIS?

00:07:21.853 --> 00:07:25.288
What if the parents' boycott
was part of a larger strategy

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:29.538
to identify and cut off the resources
that ISIS needs to function;

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:32.653
the skilled labor needed to produce food;

00:07:32.677 --> 00:07:36.266
the engineers needed
to extract and refine oil;

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.883
the media infrastructure
and communications networks

00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:40.880
and transportation systems,

00:07:40.904 --> 00:07:43.408
and the local businesses
that ISIS relies on?

00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.032
It may be difficult
to imagine defeating ISIS

00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:48.967
with action that is nonviolent.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.619
But it's time we challenge
the way we think about conflict

00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:55.058
and the choices we have in facing it.

00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:58.465
Here's an idea worth spreading:

00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:01.644
let's learn more about where
nonviolent action has worked

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:04.185
and how we can make it more powerful,

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.253
just like we do with other
systems and technologies

00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:10.836
that are constantly being refined
to better meet human needs.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:14.905
It may be that we can improve
nonviolent action

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.180
to a point where it is increasingly
used in place of war.

00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:22.913
Violence as a tool of conflict
could then be abandoned

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.344
in the same way that bows and arrows were,

00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:28.712
because we have replaced them
with weapons that are more effective.

00:08:29.427 --> 00:08:34.306
With human innovation, we can make
nonviolent struggle more powerful

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.954
than the newest and latest
technologies of war.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.473
The greatest hope for humanity
lies not in condemning violence

00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:44.860
but in making violence obsolete.

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:47.516
Thank you.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:55.935
(Applause)
