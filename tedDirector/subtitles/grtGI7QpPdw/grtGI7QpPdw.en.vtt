00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I am going to talk about myself,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
which I rarely do, because I --

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
(Laughter)

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
So it's actually drearier than self-love;

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
it's unrequited self-love.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
(Laughter)

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
But I want to, though, explain

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
because I've been through so many different forms of it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
I started with improvisation,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
which had one rule,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
you could only build on it.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And of course we live in a society that's all about

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
contradicting other peoples' reality.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
It's all about contradiction,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I see it everywhere.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
that in public opinion polls

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
is always two percent.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
75 percent of Americans

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
think Alaska is part of Canada.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
But only two percent don't know the effect

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
(Laughter)

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
seems a contradiction.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Buying it from us screams good taste."

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
(Laughter)

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160
(Laughter)

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
"Don't use big words."

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
(Laughter)

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
"Learn the lingua franca."

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.160
(Laughter)

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
(Laughter)

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And I suppose it's a contradiction that I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
talk about science when I don't know math.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
for pointing out that one of the reasons,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
that there are cultural reasons

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
I was taught to do math and read at the same time.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
and it becomes rapidly obvious

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
that there are only two kinds of men in the world:

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
dwarves and Prince Charmings.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
(Laughter)

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.160
(Laughter)

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
Of course, by talking about science

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
I also may, as I did the other night,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
incur the violent wrath of some scientists

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
who were very upset with me.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And they got very upset.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
in a serious argument.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
But I don't engage in serious arguments.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
I don't approve of them

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
Well rationality is constructed

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
that mind-body split, you know?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
The head is good, body bad.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Head is ego, body id.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
"I think therefore I am," --

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
we mean the head.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
"I ain't got no body."

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160
That's how you get rationality.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And that's why so much of humor

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
is the body asserting itself against the head.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
whacking Richard in the genital area.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
And we're laughing doubly then

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
because he's the body, but it's also --

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Voice offstage: Richard.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
(Laughter)

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
Richard. Yes but it's also the head,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
the head of the conference.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
That's the other way that humor --

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
(Laughter)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
which is, as much as we revere the head,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
we are very anti-intellectual.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
I know this because I read in the New York Times,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
after September 11,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.160
the problem in this country, facing this country

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
is the university professors and their spawn."

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:56.160
(Laughter)

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
(Laughter)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
I don't know how many of you have read it.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160
(Laughter)

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
"The act of a master

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
taking painful contemptuous possession of her,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
was the kind of rapture she wanted.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
When they lay together in bed it was,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
an act of violence.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
The agony as an act of passion."

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
So you can imagine my surprise

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
on reading in The New Yorker

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
(Laughter)

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
(Laughter)

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
"Whip inflation now."

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.160
(Laughter)

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
which is objectivity.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Objectivity basically is constructed

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
in that same S&amp;M way.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
It's the subject subjugating the object.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
That's how you assert yourself.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
You make yourself the active voice.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
And the object is the passive no-voice.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
I don't know if you know this but --

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
but in many hospital nurseries across the country,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.160
until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
the signs over the little boys cribs read,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
"I'm a boy,"

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
and the signs over the little girls cribs read,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
"It's a girl." Yeah.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160
So the passivity was culturally

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
projected onto the little girls.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
There's a poll that proves --

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.160
with a woman you actively disliked?"

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
And well, yeah.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Well, 58 percent said yes,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
which I think is overinflated though

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
because so many men if you just say,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
They don't even wait for the rest of it.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
(Laughter)

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
(Laughter)

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
That's the first callback,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
of my attempted quadruple.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
(Laughter)

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
So this subject-object thing,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
is part of something I'm very interested in

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:09.160
because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
I do. I think it can go too far.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
(Laughter)

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Maybe too far. But you know --

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
I don't think that

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
a person of color making fun of white people

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160
which is why you don't see me making fun of

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.160
(Laughter)

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
What's funny about being down to four houses?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
(Laughter)

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And I really learned this lesson

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
(Laughter)

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
and everything else,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Basically, they were making fun of them for being

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
trailer trash or white trash.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
and that you're not really hurting anybody.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
"For sale: White trash compactor."

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:48.160
(Laughter)

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
So this whole subject-object thing

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
has relevance to humor in this way.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.160
who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
And she says that Roman humor

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
mirrors the construction of Roman society.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
So that Roman society was very top/bottom,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
as ours is to some degree.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
And so was humor.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
There always had to be the butt of a joke.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
So it was always the satirist,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
like Juvenal or Martial,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
represented the audience,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
and he was going to make fun of the outsider,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
the person who didn't share that subject status.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And in stand-up of course,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
A lot of heckling is the tension

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
of trying to make sure that the

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
comedian is going to be able to dominate,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.160
and overcome the heckler.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
But I always hated it because they were

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
dictating the terms of the interaction,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
in the same way that engaging in a serious argument

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
determines the content, to some degree,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
of what you're talking about.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
And I was looking for a form

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
that didn't have that.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
I know that word is so debased now

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
by the use of it by Internet marketers.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.160
(Laughter)

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
I used to actually hang up on them.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
So the next time that one called

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
"You sound sexy."

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
(Laughter)

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
He hung up on me!

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:06.160
(Laughter)

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
But the interactivity allows the audience

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
to shape what you're going to do as much as

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
you shape their experience of the world.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
And that's really what I'm looking for.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
what exactly it is that I do,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160
I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
I mean he had laid it all out.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
And then coming to this conference,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
I realized that most everybody here

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
shared those same qualities

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
because really what trickster is

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
is an agent of change.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
Trickster is a change agent.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
And the qualities that I'm about to describe

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
are the qualities that make it possible

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
to make change happen.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.160
And one of these is boundary crossing.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
But I like to cross boundaries.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
(Phone Ringing)

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
I hope that's my agent,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
because you aren't paying me anything.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
(Laughter)

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
I'm able to see the contradiction

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
that you may not be able to see.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Like for instance a mime once --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
or a meme as he called himself.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
He was a very selfish meme.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And he said that I had to show more respect

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
because it took up to 18 years

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
to learn how to do mime properly.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160
(Laughter)

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.160
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
(Laughter)

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
(Applause)

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
And you know people, this is the problem with

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
quote, objectivity, unquote.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
When you're only surrounded by people

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
who speak the same vocabulary as you,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
or share the same set of assumptions as you,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
you start to think that that's reality.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Well, look at Michael Hawley,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
or look at Dean Kamen,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
or look at my grandmother.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
whether they wanted her to or not.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
(Laughter)

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.160
(Laughter)

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
"No, you take the prize.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
(Laughter)

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
So that's one -- this boundary crossing,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
this go-between which --

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
Fritz Lanting, is that his name,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
actually said that he was a go-between.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
That's an actual quality of the trickster.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
And this is instead of contradiction.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Where you deny the other person's reality,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
you have paradox

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
where you allow more than one reality to coexist,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
I think there's another philosophical construction.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
I'm not sure what it's called.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.160
(Laughter)

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
(Laughter)

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
around five, if that's OK with you.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.160
(Laughter)

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
And another attribute of the trickster

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160
is smart luck.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.160
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
this is another quality of the trickster.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.160
That, and I will say this to the scientists,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160
that the trickster has the ability to hold

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
his ideas lightly

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160
so that he can let room in for new ideas

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
with his ideas.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
I had no joke for that.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
(Laughter)

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
But here's how I think I like to make change,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
and that is in making connections.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
This is what I tend to see

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
almost more than contradictions.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.160
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
You know, the toes of the gecko,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160
curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
I love connections.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.160
Like I'll read that one of the two attributes

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.160
of matter in the Newtonian universe --

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.160
there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.160
one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
(Laughter)

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160
And the other one though is impenetrability.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.160
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
was the criterion of masculinity.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
Masculinity depended on you

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
being the active penetrator.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.160
And then, in economics, there's an active producer

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
and a passive consumer,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
which explains why business always has to

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.160
penetrate new markets.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.160
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
to open her markets.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.160
And didn't that feel good?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.160
(Laughter)

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160
And now we're being penetrated.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160
and planting their little flags on our genes.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.160
You know we're being penetrated.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.160
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
(Laughter)

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160
That's the second of the quadruple.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.160
I still have a way to go.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.160
(Laughter)

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.160
is short circuit people's thinking.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
You know, make you not follow your usual

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
train of association,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160
but make you rewire.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.160
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:53.160
it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.160
I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160
the woman in that joke about --

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.160
have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.160
And the mother is elderly.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
And the mother goes right through a red light.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.160
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.160
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
And the mother goes through a second red light.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.160
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.160
"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.160
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:33.160
(Laughter)

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160
And that's the shock of recognition

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
at the shock of recognition.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.160
That completes the quadruple.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160
(Laughter)

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.160
I just want to say two more things.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
One is, another characteristic of trickster

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160
is that the trickster has to

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.160
walk this fine line.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.160
He has to have poise.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.160
And you know the biggest hurdle for me,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.160
in doing what I do,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160
is constructing my performance

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.160
so that it's prepared and unprepared.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.160
Finding the balance between those things

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
is always dangerous

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.160
But being too prepared doesn't leave room

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160
for the accidents to happen.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.160
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.160
said yesterday about beauty

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.160
because in his book, Hyde says that

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.160
sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160
But to do that you have to

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.160
lose all the other qualities

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
because once you're into beauty

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.160
you're into a finished thing.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
You're into something that

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
occupies space and inhabits time.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.160
It's an actual thing.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.160
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.160
But if you don't do that,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.160
if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.160
you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:11.160
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160
When you go into beauty the probability wave

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.160
collapses into one possibility.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.160
And I like to explore all the possibilities

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.160
in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.160
that he doesn't have a home.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160
He's always on the road.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.160
I want to say to you Richard, in closing,

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.160
that in TED you've created a home.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
And thank you for inviting me into it.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160
Thank you very much.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160
(Applause)
