00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
This story

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is about taking imagination seriously.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Fourteen years ago,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
used the same way for centuries.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Today, I'm using it to create

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
the scale of hard-edged buildings

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
in cities around the world.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I never studied sculpture,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
engineering or architecture.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
In fact, after college

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I applied to seven art schools

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and was rejected by all seven.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
I went off on my own to become an artist,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and I painted for 10 years,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
when I was offered a Fulbright to India.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
The deadline for the show arrived --

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
my paints didn't.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I had to do something.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So I tried bronze casting.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I went for a walk on the beach,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
watching the fishermen

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I'd seen it every day,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
but this time I saw it differently --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
a new approach to sculpture,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
a way to make volumetric form

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
without heavy solid materials.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
My first satisfying sculpture

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
was made in collaboration with these fishermen.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
It's a self-portrait

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
titled "Wide Hips."

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
(Laughter)

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I discovered

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
their soft surfaces

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
revealed every ripple of wind

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
in constantly changing patterns.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I was mesmerized.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I continued studying craft traditions

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and collaborating with artisans,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
next in Lithuania with lace makers.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I liked the fine detail

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
it gave my work,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
but I wanted to make them larger --

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
to shift from being an object you look at

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to something you could get lost in.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Returning to India to work with those fishermen,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
we made a net

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
installed briefly in Madrid.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Thousands of people saw it,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and one of them was the urbanist

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Manual Sola-Morales

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
who was redesigning the waterfront

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in Porto, Portugal.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
He asked if I could build this

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
as a permanent piece for the city.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I didn't know if I could do that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and preserve my art.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Durable, engineered, permanent --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
those are in opposition

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
For two years, I searched for a fiber

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
that could survive ultraviolet rays,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
salt, air, pollution,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and at the same time remain soft enough

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
to move fluidly in the wind.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
We needed something to hold the net up

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
out there in the middle of the traffic circle.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
We had to engineer it

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
to move gracefully in an average breeze

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and survive in hurricane winds.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
But there was no engineering software

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
to model something porous and moving.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
named Peter Heppel.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
He helped me tackle the twin challenges

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
of precise shape

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and gentle movement.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
I couldn't build this the way I knew

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
because hand-tied knots

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
weren't going to withstand a hurricane.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So I developed a relationship

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
with an industrial fishnet factory,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
learned the variables of their machines,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and figured out a way

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to make lace with them.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
There was no language

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
into something machine operators could produce.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So we had to create one.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Three years and two children later,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
It was hard to believe

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that what I had imagined

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
was now built, permanent

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and had lost nothing in translation.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.260
(Applause)

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Now it had a sense of place.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I walked underneath it

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
for the first time.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I felt sheltered

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and, at the same time,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
connected to limitless sky.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
My life was not going to be the same.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I want to create these oases of sculpture

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
in spaces of cities around the world.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
I'm going to share two directions

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that are new in my work.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Historic Philadelphia City Hall:

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
that was lighter than netting.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So we experimented

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
with tiny atomized water particles

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to create a dry mist

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that is shaped by the wind

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and in testing, discovered

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that it can be shaped by people

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
who can interact and move through it without getting wet.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
I'm using this sculpture material

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
in real time --

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Next challenge,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
the Biennial of the Americas in Denver

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
asked, could I represent

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in a sculpture?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
(Laughter)

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I didn't know where to begin,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
but I said yes.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and the tsunami that rippled across

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
the entire Pacific Ocean.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
sped up the planet's rotation

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and literally shortened the length of the day.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So I contacted NOAA,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and translated it into this.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Its title: "1.26"

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
refers to the number of microseconds

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
that the Earth's day was shortened.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Its shape was too complex now.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
So I replaced the metal armature

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
with a soft, fine mesh

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260
of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The sculpture could now be entirely soft,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
which made it so light

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
it could tie in to existing buildings --

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
There was no software

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that could extrude these complex net forms

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and model them with gravity.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So we had to create it.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Then I got a call from New York City

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
asking if I could adapt these concepts

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to Times Square

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
or the High Line.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
This new soft structural method

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
enables me to model these

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and build these sculptures

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
at the scale of skyscrapers.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
They don't have funding yet,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
but I dream now

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
of bringing these to cities around the world

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
where they're most needed.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Fourteen years ago,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I searched for beauty

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
in the traditional things,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
in craft forms.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
to create voluptuous, billowing forms

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
the scale of buildings.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
My artistic horizons continue to grow.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I'll leave you with this story.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
An attorney in the office

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
who'd never been interested in art,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
never visited the local art museum,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
dragged everyone she could from the building

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
There they were in their business suits,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
laying in the grass,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
noticing the changing patterns of wind

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
beside people they didn't know,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
sharing the rediscovery of wonder.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Thank you.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
(Applause)

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Thank you.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
(Applause)
