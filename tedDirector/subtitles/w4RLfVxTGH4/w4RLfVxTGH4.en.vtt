00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:15.469
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:17.873
that you're a soldier
in the heat of battle.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.261
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
or a medieval archer

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.165
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.443
Regardless of your time and place,
there are some things that are constant.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.361
Your adrenaline is elevated,

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:35.194
and your actions are stemming
from these deeply ingrained reflexes,

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:39.574
reflexes rooted in a need
to protect yourself and your side

00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:41.287
and to defeat the enemy.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:46.363
So now, I'd like you to imagine
playing a very different role,

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:47.988
that of the scout.

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:51.401
The scout's job is not
to attack or defend.

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.820
The scout's job is to understand.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.294
The scout is the one going out,

00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:00.381
mapping the terrain,
identifying potential obstacles.

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:03.981
And the scout may hope to learn
that, say, there's a bridge

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.339
in a convenient location across a river.

00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:09.410
But above all, the scout
wants to know what's really there,

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:11.027
as accurately as possible.

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:17.241
And in a real, actual army, both
the soldier and the scout are essential.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:22.575
But you can also think of each
of these roles as a mindset --

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.226
a metaphor for how all of us
process information and ideas

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.717
in our daily lives.

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:32.022
What I'm going to argue today
is that having good judgment,

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:35.260
making accurate predictions,
making good decisions,

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:38.042
is mostly about which mindset you're in.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.587
To illustrate these mindsets in action,

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.095
I'm going to take you back
to 19th-century France,

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.102
where this innocuous-looking
piece of paper

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.164
launched one of the biggest
political scandals in history.

00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:56.115
It was discovered in 1894
by officers in the French general staff.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.308
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,

00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:01.257
but when they pieced it back together,

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.313
they discovered
that someone in their ranks

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:05.700
had been selling
military secrets to Germany.

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:08.819
So they launched a big investigation,

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:12.709
and their suspicions
quickly converged on this man,

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.065
Alfred Dreyfus.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.185
He had a sterling record,

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.729
no past history of wrongdoing,
no motive as far as they could tell.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:25.460
But Dreyfus was the only
Jewish officer at that rank in the army,

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:29.659
and unfortunately at this time,
the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:32.905
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting
to that on the memo

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.866
and concluded that it was a match,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.932
even though outside
professional handwriting experts

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:40.106
were much less confident
in the similarity,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.520
but never mind that.

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:43.584
They went and searched
Dreyfus's apartment,

00:02:43.608 --> 00:02:45.364
looking for any signs of espionage.

00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:48.348
They went through his files,
and they didn't find anything.

00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:51.506
This just convinced them more
that Dreyfus was not only guilty,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.823
but sneaky as well, because clearly
he had hidden all of the evidence

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:56.696
before they had managed to get to it.

00:02:57.212 --> 00:02:59.904
Next, they went and looked
through his personal history

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:02.229
for any incriminating details.

00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:03.855
They talked to his teachers,

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.664
they found that he had studied
foreign languages in school,

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:10.741
which clearly showed a desire
to conspire with foreign governments

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:11.948
later in life.

00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:17.983
His teachers also said that Dreyfus
was known for having a good memory,

00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.119
which was highly suspicious, right?

00:03:20.143 --> 00:03:23.483
You know, because a spy
has to remember a lot of things.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.099
So the case went to trial,
and Dreyfus was found guilty.

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:32.136
Afterwards, they took him out
into this public square

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.884
and ritualistically tore
his insignia from his uniform

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:37.813
and broke his sword in two.

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:39.852
This was called
the Degradation of Dreyfus.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.377
And they sentenced him
to life imprisonment

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:46.141
on the aptly named Devil's Island,

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:48.989
which is this barren rock
off the coast of South America.

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:53.306
So there he went,
and there he spent his days alone,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.834
writing letters and letters
to the French government

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:59.166
begging them to reopen his case
so they could discover his innocence.

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:02.547
But for the most part,
France considered the matter closed.

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:07.594
One thing that's really interesting
to me about the Dreyfus Affair

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:11.396
is this question of why the officers
were so convinced

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.141
that Dreyfus was guilty.

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:16.403
I mean, you might even assume
that they were setting him up,

00:04:16.427 --> 00:04:18.395
that they were intentionally framing him.

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.686
But historians don't think
that's what happened.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.869
As far as we can tell,

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:26.130
the officers genuinely believed
that the case against Dreyfus was strong.

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:28.630
Which makes you wonder:

00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.928
What does it say about the human mind

00:04:30.952 --> 00:04:33.265
that we can find such paltry evidence

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.376
to be compelling enough to convict a man?

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.496
Well, this is a case of what scientists
call "motivated reasoning."

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.574
It's this phenomenon in which
our unconscious motivations,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:45.950
our desires and fears,

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:48.320
shape the way we interpret information.

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:51.754
Some information, some ideas,
feel like our allies.

00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:54.420
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.975
And other information
or ideas are the enemy,

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.567
and we want to shoot them down.

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:03.115
So this is why I call
motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."

00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:06.993
Probably most of you have never persecuted

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:09.298
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:10.795
I assume,

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.678
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed

00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:19.824
that when the referee judges
that your team committed a foul,

00:05:19.848 --> 00:05:21.010
for example,

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:24.127
you're highly motivated
to find reasons why he's wrong.

00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:27.594
But if he judges that the other team
committed a foul -- awesome!

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:30.180
That's a good call,
let's not examine it too closely.

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.909
Or, maybe you've read
an article or a study

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:35.639
that examined some controversial policy,

00:05:35.663 --> 00:05:36.879
like capital punishment.

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:39.852
And, as researchers have demonstrated,

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:41.581
if you support capital punishment

00:05:41.605 --> 00:05:44.121
and the study shows
that it's not effective,

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:47.391
then you're highly motivated
to find all the reasons

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:49.588
why the study was poorly designed.

00:05:49.612 --> 00:05:51.818
But if it shows
that capital punishment works,

00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:53.001
it's a good study.

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:56.273
And vice versa: if you don't
support capital punishment, same thing.

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:59.126
Our judgment is strongly
influenced, unconsciously,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.428
by which side we want to win.

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:03.960
And this is ubiquitous.

00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:07.022
This shapes how we think
about our health, our relationships,

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:08.942
how we decide how to vote,

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.334
what we consider fair or ethical.

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:14.799
What's most scary to me
about motivated reasoning

00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:15.974
or soldier mindset,

00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:17.245
is how unconscious it is.

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:20.549
We can think we're being
objective and fair-minded

00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:24.040
and still wind up ruining the life
of an innocent man.

00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:27.891
However, fortunately for Dreyfus,
his story is not over.

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:29.283
This is Colonel Picquart.

00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:31.851
He's another high-ranking officer
in the French Army,

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:34.504
and like most people,
he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:39.318
Also like most people in the army,
he was at least casually anti-Semitic.

00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:42.707
But at a certain point,
Picquart began to suspect:

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:46.077
"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.626
What happened was,
he had discovered evidence

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.127
that the spying for Germany had continued,

00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:53.126
even after Dreyfus was in prison.

00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:56.812
And he had also discovered
that another officer in the army

00:06:56.836 --> 00:06:59.409
had handwriting that perfectly
matched the memo,

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:01.794
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.

00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:05.223
So he brought these discoveries
to his superiors,

00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:09.694
but to his dismay,
they either didn't care

00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:13.306
or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.703
like, "Well, all you've really shown,
Picquart, is that there's another spy

00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:21.100
who learned how to mimic
Dreyfus's handwriting,

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:24.664
and he picked up the torch of spying
after Dreyfus left.

00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:26.798
But Dreyfus is still guilty."

00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:30.879
Eventually, Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated.

00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:32.431
But it took him 10 years,

00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:34.986
and for part of that time,
he himself was in prison

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.308
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:44.491
A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story

00:07:44.515 --> 00:07:48.744
because he was an anti-Semite
and that's bad, which I agree with.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:53.974
But personally, for me,
the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic

00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:56.583
actually makes his actions more admirable,

00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:59.723
because he had the same prejudices,
the same reasons to be biased

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.532
as his fellow officers,

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:06.191
but his motivation to find the truth
and uphold it trumped all of that.

00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:08.297
So to me,

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.127
Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."

00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:16.674
It's the drive not to make
one idea win or another lose,

00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:18.622
but just to see what's really there

00:08:18.646 --> 00:08:21.121
as honestly and accurately as you can,

00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:24.425
even if it's not pretty
or convenient or pleasant.

00:08:25.444 --> 00:08:28.690
This mindset is what
I'm personally passionate about.

00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:33.843
And I've spent the last few years
examining and trying to figure out

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.850
what causes scout mindset.

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:39.022
Why are some people, sometimes at least,

00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:42.834
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations

00:08:42.858 --> 00:08:45.153
and just try to see the facts
and the evidence

00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:46.650
as objectively as they can?

00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:50.613
And the answer is emotional.

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:54.886
So, just as soldier mindset
is rooted in emotions

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.898
like defensiveness or tribalism,

00:08:58.615 --> 00:08:59.981
scout mindset is, too.

00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:01.991
It's just rooted in different emotions.

00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:05.434
For example, scouts are curious.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:09.004
They're more likely to say
they feel pleasure

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:10.688
when they learn new information

00:09:10.712 --> 00:09:13.023
or an itch to solve a puzzle.

00:09:13.544 --> 00:09:16.713
They're more likely to feel intrigued
when they encounter something

00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:18.833
that contradicts their expectations.

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:21.183
Scouts also have different values.

00:09:21.207 --> 00:09:24.279
They're more likely to say
they think it's virtuous

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:25.792
to test your own beliefs,

00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.522
and they're less likely to say
that someone who changes his mind

00:09:29.546 --> 00:09:30.808
seems weak.

00:09:30.832 --> 00:09:32.717
And above all, scouts are grounded,

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:36.646
which means their self-worth as a person

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:42.136
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.414
So they can believe
that capital punishment works.

00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:48.251
If studies come out showing
that it doesn't, they can say,

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:52.184
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."

00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:58.280
This cluster of traits
is what researchers have found --

00:09:58.304 --> 00:10:00.010
and I've also found anecdotally --

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.865
predicts good judgment.

00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:05.669
And the key takeaway I want
to leave you with about those traits

00:10:05.693 --> 00:10:09.330
is that they're primarily
not about how smart you are

00:10:09.354 --> 00:10:11.352
or about how much you know.

00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:14.182
In fact, they don't correlate
very much with IQ at all.

00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:16.288
They're about how you feel.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:20.872
There's a quote that I keep
coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.

00:10:20.896 --> 00:10:22.837
He's the author of "The Little Prince."

00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:25.630
He said, "If you want to build a ship,

00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:30.855
don't drum up your men
to collect wood and give orders

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.299
and distribute the work.

00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:37.236
Instead, teach them to yearn
for the vast and endless sea."

00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:40.398
In other words, I claim,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.010
if we really want to improve
our judgment as individuals

00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:45.477
and as societies,

00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:49.010
what we need most
is not more instruction in logic

00:10:49.034 --> 00:10:52.582
or rhetoric or probability or economics,

00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.689
even though those things
are quite valuable.

00:10:54.713 --> 00:10:58.017
But what we most need
to use those principles well

00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:59.459
is scout mindset.

00:10:59.483 --> 00:11:01.363
We need to change the way we feel.

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:05.569
We need to learn how to feel proud
instead of ashamed

00:11:05.593 --> 00:11:08.231
when we notice we might
have been wrong about something.

00:11:08.255 --> 00:11:11.383
We need to learn how to feel intrigued
instead of defensive

00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:15.650
when we encounter some information
that contradicts our beliefs.

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:19.415
So the question I want
to leave you with is:

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.967
What do you most yearn for?

00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.398
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?

00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:29.722
Or do you yearn to see the world
as clearly as you possibly can?

00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:31.503
Thank you.

00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:36.524
(Applause)
