00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:15.066
Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.391
three multiple choice questions.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.122
Use this device. Use this device to answer.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:22.677
The first question is, how did the number

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:24.798
of deaths per year

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.090
from natural disaster,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.691
how did that change during the last century?

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:30.070
Did it more than double,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.852
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:35.226
or did it decrease to less than half?

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.630
Please answer A, B or C.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.730
I see lots of answers. This is much
faster than I do it at universities.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.887
They are so slow. They keep
thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:46.909
Oh, very, very good.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.772
And we go to the next question.

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:51.431
So how long did women 30 years old

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.527
in the world go to school:

00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:55.561
seven years, five years or three years?

00:00:55.561 --> 00:01:02.064
A, B or C? Please answer.

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:04.102
And we go to the next question.

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:08.023
In the last 20 years, how did the percentage

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.850
of people in the world

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.067
who live in extreme poverty change?

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.628
Extreme poverty — not having 
enough food for the day.

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:16.689
Did it almost double,

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.238
did it remain more or less the same,

00:01:18.238 --> 00:01:19.751
or did it halve?

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:23.771
A, B or C?

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.927
Now, answers.

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:28.021
You see,

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.746
deaths from natural disasters in the world,

00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:31.668
you can see it from this graph here,

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:34.448
from 1900 to 2000.

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.703
In 1900, there was about half a million people

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:39.790
who died every year from natural disasters:

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.887
floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruption, whatever, droughts.

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:47.607
And then, how did that change?

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.093
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:52.952
This is how they answered.

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:54.881
The Swedish public answered like this:

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.353
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,

00:01:56.353 --> 00:01:58.558
38 percent said it's more or less the same,

00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:00.656
12 said it had halved.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.308
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,

00:02:03.308 --> 00:02:06.274
and it goes up and down,

00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:08.826
and it goes to the Second World War,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:12.226
and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling

00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:14.072
and it's down to much less than half.

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:16.680
The world has been much, much more capable

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.294
as the decades go by

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:20.685
to protect people from this, you know.

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.551
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.042
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:35.888
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:43.257
The chimps don't watch the evening news,

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:44.715
so the chimps,

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:48.147
they choose by random, so the
Swedes answer worse than random.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:51.086
Now how did you do?

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:54.048
That's you.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.273
You were beaten by the chimps.

00:02:56.273 --> 00:02:58.063
(Laughter)

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:01.038
But it was close.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:05.059
You were three times better than the Swedes,

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.302
but that's not enough.

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.884
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:12.415
You must have higher ambitions in the world.

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:15.823
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:17.839
Here, you can see men went eight years.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.620
How long did women go to school?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.369
Well, we asked the Swedes like this,

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.586
and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.948
The right answer is probably the one

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:29.683
the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?

00:03:29.683 --> 00:03:31.186
(Laughter)

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:33.624
Let's see, let's see. Here we come.

00:03:33.624 --> 00:03:38.025
Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:41.438
This is the U.S. public.

00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:45.313
And this is you. Here you come.

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:49.325
Ooh.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.154
Well, congratulations, you're
twice as good as the Swedes,

00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:53.574
but you don't need me —

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:58.388
So how come? I think it's like this,

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:01.110
that everyone is aware that there are countries

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.214
and there are areas

00:04:02.214 --> 00:04:04.352
where girls have great difficulties.

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:06.260
They are stopped when they go to school,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.325
and it's disgusting.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.222
But in the majority of the world,

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:11.909
where most people in the world live,

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.891
most countries, girls today go to school

00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.430
as long as boys, more or less.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.489
That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.573
not at all.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:26.114
They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,

00:04:26.114 --> 00:04:28.346
but schooling is there in the world today.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:32.441
Now, we miss the majority.

00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.764
When you answer, you answer
according to the worst places,

00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:38.620
and there you are right, but you miss the majority.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.096
What about poverty?

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:42.999
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.774
was almost halved,

00:04:44.774 --> 00:04:46.453
and in U.S., when we asked the public,

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:50.437
only five percent got it right.

00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.306
And you?

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:57.164
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.525
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:05.142
That little, just a few of you!

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:08.821
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.

00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:10.615
And many in the rich countries,

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:14.275
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.

00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:15.928
Of course they think so,

00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:18.892
because they don't even know what has happened.

00:05:18.892 --> 00:05:21.242
The first thing to think about the future

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:23.263
is to know about the present.

00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:26.315
These questions were a few of the first ones

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:29.700
in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.720
in Gapminder Foundation that we run,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.516
and it was started, this project, last year

00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:39.922
by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:41.504
He's cofounder and director,

00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:43.048
and he wanted, Ola told me

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:45.608
we have to be more systematic

00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:47.481
when we fight devastating ignorance.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.699
So already the pilots reveal this,

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.909
that so many in the public score worse than random,

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.992
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:57.020
and one of the main preconceived ideas

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.889
is about world income distribution.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.720
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.939
It's the number of people on each income,

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.830
from one dollar a day —

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.281
(Applause)

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:13.356
See, there was one hump here,

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:15.254
around one dollar a day,

00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:16.710
and then there was one hump here

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.725
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.471
The world was two groups.

00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:24.081
It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,

00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:26.093
the poor ones and the rich ones,

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:27.657
and there were fewer in between.

00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:29.826
But look how this has changed:

00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:31.652
As I go forward, what has changed,

00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:33.308
the world population has grown,

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:36.076
and the humps start to merge.

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:38.846
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,

00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:41.973
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world

00:06:41.973 --> 00:06:44.228
with one hump only.

00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:46.152
The percent in poverty has decreased.

00:06:46.152 --> 00:06:47.729
Still it's appalling

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.930
that so many remain in extreme poverty.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.953
We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,

00:06:53.953 --> 00:06:57.002
but that can be ended now.

00:06:57.002 --> 00:06:59.305
The challenge we have now

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:02.113
is to get away from that,
understand where the majority is,

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:05.357
and that is very clearly shown in this question.

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:07.590
We asked, what is the percentage of the world's

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.244
one-year-old children who have got those

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.854
basic vaccines against measles and other things

00:07:11.854 --> 00:07:13.347
that we have had for many years:

00:07:13.347 --> 00:07:15.369
20, 50 or 80 percent?

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:19.442
Now, this is what the U.S.
public and the Swedish answered.

00:07:19.442 --> 00:07:20.318
Look at the Swedish result:

00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:22.380
you know what the right answer is.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.053
(Laughter)

00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:29.556
Who the heck is a professor of
global health in that country?

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:31.228
Well, it's me. It's me.

00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:33.190
(Laughter)

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.672
It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:38.770
(Applause)

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.484
However, Ola's approach

00:07:42.484 --> 00:07:45.642
to really measure what we know made headlines,

00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:48.705
and CNN published these results on their web

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:50.852
and they had the questions there, millions answered,

00:07:50.852 --> 00:07:54.334
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,

00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:56.647
and this was one of the comments.

00:07:56.647 --> 00:08:00.191
"I bet no member of the media
passed the test," he said.

00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:02.830
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.535
You are invited to media conferences.

00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:06.812
Give it to them and measure what the media know."

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:08.736
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:11.413
for the first time, the informal results

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:15.338
from a conference with U.S. media.

00:08:15.338 --> 00:08:20.224
And then, lately, from the European Union media.

00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:21.492
(Laughter)

00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:23.697
You see, the problem is not that people

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:25.645
don't read and listen to the media.

00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:29.864
The problem is that the
media doesn't know themselves.

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:31.445
What shall we do about this, Ola?

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:32.943
Do we have any ideas?

00:08:32.943 --> 00:08:44.037
(Applause)

00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:47.746
Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:51.561
I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.

00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:54.194
Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you

00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:58.753
by showing why it was not your fault, actually.

00:08:58.753 --> 00:09:00.775
Then, I will equip you with some tricks

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.865
for beating the chimps in the future.

00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:05.079
That's basically what I will do.

00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.282
But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,

00:09:07.282 --> 00:09:09.889
and it all starts in this place.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:13.579
It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:17.376
It's a neighborhood where I grew up,

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:20.977
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.963
Actually, it has exactly the same problem

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.572
which existed in all the neighborhoods

00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:26.920
where you grew up as well.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.582
It was not representative. Okay?

00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:32.025
It gave me a very biased view

00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:34.373
of how life is on this planet.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:37.365
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:38.637
We have a personal bias.

00:09:38.637 --> 00:09:40.750
We have all different experiences

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.390
from communities and people we meet,

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.377
and on top of this, we start school,

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.298
and we add the next problem.

00:09:47.298 --> 00:09:48.442
Well, I like schools,

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:53.529
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:56.130
because they learned something
when they went to school,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.683
and now they describe this world to the students

00:09:58.683 --> 00:10:00.889
without any bad intentions,

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.118
and those books, of course, that are printed

00:10:03.118 --> 00:10:06.049
are outdated in a world that changes.

00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:07.296
And there is really no practice

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:10.545
to keep the teaching material up to date.

00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:12.529
So that's what we are focusing on.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.098
So we have these outdated facts

00:10:14.098 --> 00:10:17.032
added on top of our personal bias.

00:10:17.032 --> 00:10:19.508
What happens next is news, okay?

00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:22.025
An excellent journalist knows how to pick

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:24.431
the story that will make headlines,

00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:27.030
and people will read it because it's sensational.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.995
Unusual events are more interesting, no?

00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:32.710
And they are exaggerated,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.139
and especially things we're afraid of.

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:38.567
A shark attack on a Swedish person

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:42.282
will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.

00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:46.001
So these three skewed sources of information

00:10:46.001 --> 00:10:49.276
were really hard to get away from.

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:50.907
They kind of bombard us

00:10:50.907 --> 00:10:54.713
and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,

00:10:54.713 --> 00:10:57.450
and on top of it we put the very thing

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.716
that makes us humans, our human intuition.

00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:04.892
It was good in evolution.

00:11:04.892 --> 00:11:06.150
It helped us generalize

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.408
and jump to conclusions very, very fast.

00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:12.376
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,

00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:15.660
and we seek causality where there is none,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.597
and we then get an illusion of confidence

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.603
where we believe that we are the best car drivers,

00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:25.343
above the average.

00:11:25.343 --> 00:11:26.705
Everybody answered that question,

00:11:26.705 --> 00:11:27.974
"Yeah, I drive cars better."

00:11:27.974 --> 00:11:30.271
Okay, this was good evolutionarily,

00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:32.104
but now when it comes to the worldview,

00:11:32.104 --> 00:11:34.966
it is the exact reason why it's upside down.

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:37.889
The trends that are increasing are instead falling,

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.471
and the other way around,

00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:43.471
and in this case, the chimps
use our intuition against us,

00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:46.911
and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.

00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.394
It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?

00:11:49.394 --> 00:11:51.766
So how do we solve such problems?

00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:53.441
First, we need to measure it,

00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.843
and then we need to cure it.

00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:57.375
So by measuring it we can understand

00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.699
what is the pattern of ignorance.

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:01.235
We started the pilot last year,

00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:03.704
and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter

00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:07.285
a lot of ignorance across the whole world,

00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:10.898
and the idea is really to

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.875
scale it up to all domains

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.423
or dimensions of global development,

00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:19.505
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.715
gender equality, energy, finance.

00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:25.448
All different sectors have facts,

00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:27.044
and there are organizations trying to spread

00:12:27.044 --> 00:12:28.970
awareness about these facts.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.674
So I've started actually contacting some of them,

00:12:32.674 --> 00:12:36.015
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,

00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:38.613
and asking them, what are your favorite facts

00:12:38.613 --> 00:12:40.506
which you think the public doesn't know?

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:42.084
Okay, I gather those facts.

00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:45.619
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:46.918
And then we poll the public

00:12:46.918 --> 00:12:48.855
and see where they score worst.

00:12:48.855 --> 00:12:50.201
So we get a shorter list

00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:51.257
with the terrible results,

00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:53.806
like some few examples from Hans,

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.723
and we have no problem finding these kinds

00:12:55.723 --> 00:12:56.938
of terrible results.

00:12:56.938 --> 00:12:59.783
Okay, this little shortlist, what
are we going to do with it?

00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:03.909
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,

00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:05.771
a global knowledge certificate,

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.674
which you can use, if you're a large organization,

00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:12.429
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:16.057
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.

00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:19.020
Basically meaning, we don't hire people

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.290
who score like chimpanzees.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.650
Of course you shouldn't.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.921
So maybe 10 years from now,

00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:27.913
if this project succeeds,

00:13:27.913 --> 00:13:30.161
you will be sitting in an interview

00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:34.367
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.

00:13:34.367 --> 00:13:37.730
So now we come to the practical tricks.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.634
How are you going to succeed?

00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:43.213
There is, of course, one way,

00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:44.950
which is to sit down late nights

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.105
and learn all the facts by heart

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:48.873
by reading all these reports.

00:13:48.873 --> 00:13:50.885
That will never happen, actually.

00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:53.594
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.

00:13:53.594 --> 00:13:54.967
People don't have that time.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:58.350
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.124
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.

00:14:01.124 --> 00:14:02.568
We need to be able to generalize.

00:14:02.568 --> 00:14:04.673
So now I'm going to show you some tricks

00:14:04.673 --> 00:14:07.223
where the misconceptions are turned around

00:14:07.223 --> 00:14:10.431
into rules of thumb.

00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:12.445
Let's start with the first misconception.

00:14:12.445 --> 00:14:14.082
This is very widespread.

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:15.948
Everything is getting worse.

00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:19.218
You heard it. You thought it yourself.

00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:22.247
The other way to think is, most things improve.

00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:24.383
So you're sitting with a question in front of you

00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:27.616
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:30.600
Okay? Don't go for the worse.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.963
That will help you score better on our tests.

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:34.179
(Applause)

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:38.405
That was the first one.

00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:40.164
There are rich and poor

00:14:40.164 --> 00:14:41.630
and the gap is increasing.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.285
It's a terrible inequality.

00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:45.486
Yeah, it's an unequal world,

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:47.811
but when you look at the data, it's one hump.

00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:49.665
Okay? If you feel unsure,

00:14:49.665 --> 00:14:52.418
go for "the most people are in the middle."

00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:54.401
That's going to help you get the answer right.

00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:58.108
Now, the next preconceived idea is

00:14:58.108 --> 00:15:01.733
first countries and people need to be very, very rich

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:04.059
to get the social development

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:07.510
like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.196
No, no, no. That's wrong.

00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:11.316
Look: that huge hump in the middle

00:15:11.316 --> 00:15:13.759
already have girls in school.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:16.087
So if you are unsure, go for the

00:15:16.087 --> 00:15:17.482
"the majority already have this,"

00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:20.525
like electricity and girls in
school, these kinds of things.

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:22.741
They're only rules of thumb,

00:15:22.741 --> 00:15:25.131
so of course they don't apply to everything,

00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:26.788
but this is how you can generalize.

00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:28.753
Let's look at the last one.

00:15:28.753 --> 00:15:32.054
If something, yes, this is a good one,

00:15:32.054 --> 00:15:34.227
sharks are dangerous.

00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:38.626
No — well, yes, but they are not so important

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:41.602
in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.

00:15:41.602 --> 00:15:44.133
I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.977
So as soon as I see a question
about things I'm afraid of,

00:15:46.977 --> 00:15:49.910
which might be earthquakes, other religions,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.948
maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,

00:15:52.948 --> 00:15:54.107
anything that makes me feel,

00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.608
assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.

00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:58.445
That's a rule of thumb.

00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:00.604
Of course there are dangerous 
things that are also great.

00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:04.189
Sharks kill very, very few.
That's how you should think.

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:07.927
With these four rules of thumb,

00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:11.287
you could probably answer better than the chimps,

00:16:11.287 --> 00:16:13.241
because the chimps cannot do this.

00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.844
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.

00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:19.856
And hopefully we can turn your world around

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.691
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.612
(Applause)

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.248
That's a systematic approach.

00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:35.812
Now the question, is this important?

00:16:35.812 --> 00:16:38.538
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:41.785
extreme poverty and how to fight it,

00:16:41.785 --> 00:16:43.830
and how to bring girls in school.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.170
When we realize that actually it's
succeeding, we can understand it.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.982
But is it important for everyone else

00:16:49.982 --> 00:16:52.436
who cares about the rich end of this scale?

00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:54.480
I would say yes, extremely important,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.989
for the same reason.

00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:59.054
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,

00:16:59.054 --> 00:17:00.672
you might have a chance to understand

00:17:00.672 --> 00:17:02.426
what's coming next in the future.

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:04.864
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.

00:17:04.864 --> 00:17:06.214
That's when I was born,

00:17:06.214 --> 00:17:09.233
and I selected the West.

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:13.416
That's the current EU countries and North America.

00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:16.799
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.880
in terms of how rich you are.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.131
These are the people who can afford

00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:24.709
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:28.017
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived

00:17:28.017 --> 00:17:30.984
outside EU and North America.

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:33.313
But this has changed, okay?

00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:38.056
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.444
Today it's 50/50.

00:17:39.444 --> 00:17:43.125
The Western domination is over, as of today.

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.324
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?

00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:48.567
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:54.598
I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,
International Monetary Fund, website.

00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:58.761
They have a forecast for the next 
five years of GDP per capita.

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:01.778
So I can use that to go five years into the future,

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:05.113
assuming the income inequality 
of each country is the same.

00:18:05.113 --> 00:18:07.040
I did that, but I went even further.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.218
I used those five years for the next 20 years

00:18:10.218 --> 00:18:15.495
with the same speed, just as an 
experiment what might actually happen.

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:16.862
Let's move into the future.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:22.082
In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.

00:18:22.082 --> 00:18:25.118
In 2025, 63 percent.

00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:34.355
2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is 
outnumbered in the rich consumer market.

00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:37.702
These are just projections of 
GDP per capita into the future.

00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:40.057
Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers

00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:43.675
are going to live outside North America and Europe.

00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:47.873
So yes, I think it's a good idea for 
a company to use this certificate

00:18:47.873 --> 00:18:51.280
to make sure to make fact-
based decisions in the future.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.756
Thank you very much.

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:55.257
(Applause)
