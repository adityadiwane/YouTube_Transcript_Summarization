00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:15.047
I've spent my life working on sustainability.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.102
I set up a climate change NGO

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.422
called The Climate Group.

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.813
I worked on forestry issues in WWF.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.889
I worked on development and agriculture issues

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.624
in the U.N. system.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.548
About 25 years in total,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.271
and then three years ago, I found myself talking to

00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:33.556
IKEA's CEO about joining his team.

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.582
Like many people here, well,

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:39.517
I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:44.203
so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:47.010
But first, let's just take three numbers.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.081
The first number is three:

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.641
three billion people.

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.452
This is the number of people joining

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.504
the global middle class by 2030,

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:55.813
coming out of poverty.

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.054
It's fantastic for them and their families,

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:01.097
but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:03.394
and this swells that number to five,

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:06.724
a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:08.601
The second number is six:

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.746
This is six degrees centigrade,

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:13.310
what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.361
We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.709
or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.398
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather

00:01:20.398 --> 00:01:22.241
we've been having the last few years,

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.823
much of that is due to just one degree warming,

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:27.118
and we need CO2 emissions to peak

00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:29.350
by the end of this decade globally

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.078
and then come down.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:35.149
It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.910
The third number is 12:

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.403
That's the number of cities in the world

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:40.194
that had a million or more people

00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:41.627
when my grandmother was born.

00:01:41.627 --> 00:01:43.247
You can see my grandmother there.

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:45.290
That was in the beginning of the last century.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.306
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.327
the ninth largest city in the world.

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:52.032
Now there are 500 cities, nearly,

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:54.463
with a million people or more in them.

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:57.807
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,

00:01:57.807 --> 00:02:01.551
that's the century when we build all the world's cities,

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.961
the century that we're in the middle of right now.

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.807
Every other century was kind of practice,

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:11.625
and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.380
So think about it.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.150
We're building cities like never before,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.676
bringing people out of poverty like never before,

00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:21.051
and changing the climate like never before.

00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.111
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.776
to a must-do.

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:28.609
it's about what we do right here, right now,

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.290
and for the rest of our working lives.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.322
So I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.695
what business can do

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:37.997
and what a business like IKEA can do,

00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:40.664
and we have a sustainability strategy

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:42.661
called "people and planet positive"

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.308
to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.

00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:48.443
Why would we not want to have a positive impact

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:51.031
on the world as a business?

00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:53.519
Other companies have sustainability strategies.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.357
I'm going to refer to some of those as well,

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:56.894
and I'm just going to mention a few

00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:59.490
of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.506
But first, let's think of customers.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:05.331
We know from asking people from China to the U.S.

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:08.659
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.541
after the day-to-day issues,

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.118
the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:15.097
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?

00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:18.559
Then they care about big issues like climate change.

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.991
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,

00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.983
and they expect business to help,

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:27.777
and they're a little bit disappointed today.

00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:30.411
So take your mind back and think

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:31.998
of the first sustainable products.

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.911
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.

00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.965
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:40.812
that took five minutes to warm up

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:43.883
and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:47.251
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.983
So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,

00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:52.089
or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.758
or sometimes all three together,

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:57.203
you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.101
It wasn't a great start.

00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.389
Today we have choices.

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.686
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:10.487
sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,

00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:12.350
functional or useless.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.215
So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.535
sustainable products.

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:19.831
Let's take the LED.

00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:23.245
The LED is the next best thing to daylight.

00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:26.426
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:27.934
I'm not going to ask for a show of hands

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.223
of how many of you still have them in your homes,

00:04:30.223 --> 00:04:33.045
wasting energy every time you switch them on --

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:34.482
change them after this --

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:38.175
or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --

00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:41.966
but those old incandescent light bulbs

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.988
really should have been sold as heaters.

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:46.965
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:49.407
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.

00:04:49.407 --> 00:04:51.479
Now we have lights that produce light

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.171
and a little bit of heat on the side.

00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.997
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:58.040
that you would have done in an old incandescent.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.775
And the best thing is, they'll also last

00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:01.354
for more than 20 years.

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:02.610
So think about that.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.106
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:07.182
probably more if you're in this audience.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.792
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:12.344
Your kids could go to school, go to college,

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:14.299
go away and have kids of their own, come back,

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:15.725
bring the grandkids,

00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:19.611
you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.450
So LEDs are fantastic.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.976
What we decided to do

00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:26.929
was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:29.155
and continue to push all the old bulbs,

00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:31.146
the halogens and the CFLs.

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:34.076
We decided, over the next two years,

00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:36.591
we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.

00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:37.959
We will go all in.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:39.668
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:41.112
go 100 percent,

00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:42.703
because then you stop investing in the old stuff,

00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:44.857
you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,

00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:47.186
you use your supply chain and your creativity

00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.943
and you get the prices down so everybody can afford

00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:52.894
the best lights so they can save energy.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:57.044
(Applause)

00:05:57.044 --> 00:06:00.173
It's not just about products in people's homes.

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:01.817
We've got to think about the raw materials

00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:03.999
that produce our products.

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:05.826
Obviously there's fantastic opportunities

00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:07.320
with recycled materials,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.163
and we can and will go zero waste.

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:12.151
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.

00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:15.593
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.

00:06:15.593 --> 00:06:17.383
Let's take cotton.

00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:19.112
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.523
are wearing cotton right now.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:22.057
It's a brilliant textile in use.

00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:23.624
It's really dirty in production.

00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:27.758
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:29.378
So we've worked with others,

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.980
with other businesses and NGOs,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.836
on the Better Cotton Initiative,

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:35.005
working right back down to the farm,

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:36.840
and there you can halve the amount of water

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.671
and halve the chemical inputs,

00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:41.567
the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.236
of running many of these farms

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.280
with farmers with low incomes

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.983
can be chemical imports.

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.128
Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.

00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:52.003
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.

00:06:52.003 --> 00:06:53.730
Already hundreds of thousands of farmers

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.320
have been reached,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.984
and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.326
Again, we're going all-in.

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:02.476
By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:05.462
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.

00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:07.134
People sometimes think that

00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:08.599
100 percent's going to be hard,

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.370
and we've had the conversation in the business.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.212
Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do

00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:14.199
than 90 percent or 50 percent.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.631
If you have a 90 percent target,

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:17.052
everyone in the business finds a reason

00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:18.857
to be in the 10 percent.

00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:22.427
When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,

00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:25.317
and businesspeople like clarity,

00:07:25.317 --> 00:07:27.982
because then you just get the job done.

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:30.730
So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.324
You've got illegal logging

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:35.149
and deforestation still on a very large scale,

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.849
or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.984
that we can be proud of.

00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:42.066
It's a simple choice, so we've worked

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:44.610
for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.980
with literally hundreds of other organizations,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.420
and there's a point here about collaboration.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.315
So hundreds of others, of NGOs,

00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:53.897
of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,

00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:55.569
have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:57.351
which sets standards for forestry

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.873
and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.

00:07:59.873 --> 00:08:02.116
Now together, through our supply chain,

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:03.983
with partners, we've managed to certify

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.860
35 million hectares of forestry.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.397
That's about the size of Germany.

00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:11.185
And we've decided in the next three years,

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:13.220
we will double the volume of certified material

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.358
we put through our business.

00:08:15.358 --> 00:08:17.998
So be decisive on these issues.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.969
Use your supply chain to drive good.

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:21.995
But then it comes to your operations.

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:24.645
Some things are certain, I think.

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.660
We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.583
We know the sun will be shining somewhere,

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.675
and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.

00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:36.327
So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?

00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:38.555
And why not take control of it ourselves?

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:40.915
So we're going 100 percent renewable.

00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:43.671
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:45.691
than the energy we consume as a business.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.667
For all of our stores, our own factories,

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.045
our distribution centers,

00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:51.499
we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:54.873
and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate

00:08:54.873 --> 00:08:57.500
in six countries, and we're not done yet.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.284
But think of a solar panel.

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:01.463
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.

00:09:01.463 --> 00:09:02.956
The electricity is free.

00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:04.761
Every time the sun comes out after that,

00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.196
the electricity is free.

00:09:06.196 --> 00:09:08.213
So this is a good thing for the CFO,

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:10.156
not just the sustainability guy.

00:09:10.156 --> 00:09:13.190
Every business can do things like this.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.169
But then we've got to look beyond our operations,

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:17.918
and I think everybody would agree

00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:20.290
that now business has to take full responsibility

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.494
for the impacts of your supply chain.

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:24.810
Many businesses now, fortunately,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.817
have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:28.863
but not every business. Far from it.

00:09:28.863 --> 00:09:31.377
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.

00:09:31.377 --> 00:09:33.118
We found there was a risk

00:09:33.118 --> 00:09:35.120
of child labor in the supply chain,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.630
and people in the business were shocked.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.954
And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.

00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:43.098
So a code of conduct was developed,

00:09:43.098 --> 00:09:46.049
and now we have 80 auditors out in the world

00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:48.080
every day making sure all our factories

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.364
secure good working conditions

00:09:50.364 --> 00:09:51.913
and protect human rights

00:09:51.913 --> 00:09:54.174
and make sure there is no child labor.

00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:56.334
But it's not just as simple as making sure

00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:58.366
there's no child labor.

00:09:58.366 --> 00:10:00.566
You've got to say that's not enough today.

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.614
I think we'd all agree that children

00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:04.810
are the most important people in the world

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.707
and the most vulnerable.

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:08.955
So what can a business do today

00:10:08.955 --> 00:10:10.839
to actually use your total value chain

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.118
to support a better quality of life

00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:14.706
and protect child rights?

00:10:14.706 --> 00:10:17.003
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children

00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.478
on developing some new business principles

00:10:19.478 --> 00:10:20.943
with children's rights.

00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:22.760
Increasing numbers of businesses

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.280
are signing up to these,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.743
but actually in a survey, many business leaders

00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:29.610
said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.109
So what we decided to do was, we will look

00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:34.670
and ask ourselves the tough questions

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.734
with partners who know more than us,

00:10:36.734 --> 00:10:39.691
what can we do to go beyond our business

00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:41.533
to help improve the lives of children?

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.352
We also have a foundation

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.247
that's committed to work through partners

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:47.870
and help improve the lives and protect the rights

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.737
of 100 million children by 2015.

00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.413
You know the phrase,

00:10:52.413 --> 00:10:55.791
you can manage what you measure?

00:10:55.791 --> 00:11:00.441
Well, you should measure what you care about.

00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:01.990
If you're not measuring things,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.734
you don't care and you don't know.

00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:06.903
So let's take an example, measure the things

00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:09.060
that are important in your business.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.343
Isn't it about time that businesses

00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:14.321
were led equally by men and women?

00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:17.304
(Applause)

00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:22.446
So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA

00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:25.410
that 47 percent are women today,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.806
but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap

00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:30.093
and follow it all the way through to senior management.

00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:32.939
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:35.898
So we've launched a women's open network

00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:37.423
this week in IKEA,

00:11:37.423 --> 00:11:39.599
and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.014
So the message here is,

00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:43.398
measure what you care about and lead the change,

00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:46.401
and don't wait a hundred years.

00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:48.838
So we've gone from sustainability

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:54.074
being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:57.226
It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.

00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:02.161
And everybody can do something on this as an individual.

00:12:02.161 --> 00:12:04.357
Be a discerning consumer.

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:06.055
Vote with your wallets.

00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:08.235
Search out the companies

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:10.930
that are acting on this.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.977
But also, there are other businesses already acting.

00:12:13.977 --> 00:12:16.122
I mentioned renewable energy.

00:12:16.122 --> 00:12:18.440
You go to Google or Lego,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.700
they're going 100 percent renewable too,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.067
in the same way that we are.

00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:25.193
On having really good sustainability strategies,

00:12:25.193 --> 00:12:28.437
there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,

00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:30.591
Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.

00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:32.749
But I don't think any of those businesses would say

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:35.014
they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.

00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:37.380
We'll make mistakes going forward,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.897
but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:41.586
having a dialogue with the right partners,

00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:46.102
and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.

00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:48.901
So if you're a business leader,

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.856
if you're not already weaving sustainability

00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:54.264
right into the heart of your business model,

00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:56.155
I'd urge you to do so.

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.130
And together, we can help create

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.130
a sustainable world,

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.259
and, if we get it right,

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:03.748
we can make sustainability

00:13:03.748 --> 00:13:05.370
affordable for the many people,

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.067
not a luxury for the few.

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:08.424
Thank you.

00:13:08.424 --> 00:13:13.235
(Applause)
