00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:15.897
When you walk around
the place where you live,

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.350
most of the times,

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.539
you feel pretty safe
and comfortable, right?

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.912
Now imagine if there were land mines

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:26.109
buried right here,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.761
scattered around,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.269
and you'd never know
when you might step on one.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.023
That's how it is for many
in my home country, Colombia.

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:39.123
As a result of a 50-year
internal armed conflict,

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:41.584
we have an undetermined
number of land mines

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.505
buried throughout the countryside,

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:46.687
affecting more than one third
of the Colombian population.

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:51.430
These anti-personnel mines

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:54.456
are designed to maim,
not to kill their targets.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.170
The logic behind this, which is awful,

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:03.770
is that more resources are taken up
caring for an injured soldier

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:06.111
than dealing with a person
who has been killed.

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:11.791
I met Adriana Rodriguez
about five years ago

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.082
while I was working
for the Colombian government

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.029
as a documentary filmmaker.

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:18.030
During the conflict,

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:19.832
she was forced to leave her house ...

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.046
with her kids in her arms.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:27.460
One day, one of her neighbors was killed

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.610
while he stepped on a land mine.

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:36.558
He was actually inside
an abandoned house, not outside,

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:39.732
a house exactly like the one
Adriana was forced to leave.

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:44.861
Ever since, she has been living
with the fear that she, or her children,

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:46.233
might step on a land mine.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.068
You know, the Colombian conflict
has been running for so long

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:56.457
that neither me nor my mom
have seen our country in peace,

00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:57.949
and for someone like me,

00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:01.434
who has been living detached
from all this suffering,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:03.353
there was only two options:

00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:06.811
either I get used to it,

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.857
or I can try to change it
with all my heart.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.648
And I have to admit
that for almost 30 years,

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:17.631
I was getting used to it, you know?

00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:22.159
But something changed for me
when I met my wife.

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.449
She is a political scientist

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:27.583
completely passionate
about the Colombian armed conflict.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.044
She helped me to understand

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:34.440
how deeply our country has
been affected by land mines and by war.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.759
We decided to come here
to the United States

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.831
in search of new skills

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:44.085
that would enable us to contribute
in a fair way to our society,

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.109
and maybe even help heal it.

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:48.535
While in grad school,

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:49.769
I started developing

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:52.833
an augmented reality,
really broad application

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:56.165
to help military personnel
to deactivate land mines more safely.

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.211
During that time, I also realized

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:02.862
that Colombia is not
the only country in the world

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:05.282
that has to worry about land mines.

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:09.569
In fact, more than 58 countries

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:13.362
are still contaminated
with any sort of explosive device.

00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:17.673
Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.728
in countries like Libya,
Syria, Ukraine and Yemen,

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:24.348
the number of [land mine
casualties] almost doubled,

00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:30.287
from 3,695 to 6,461 people.

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.235
Imagine that.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.195
While some countries
are trying to get rid of land mines,

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.638
some others are increasing their use.

00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:42.744
But what happens when a conflict
that involved land mines

00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:44.076
comes to an end?

00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:46.965
There are two consequences.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.648
On the one hand,

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:53.360
the internally displaced population
will start returning to their lands,

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.232
and on the other hand,

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:58.891
hidden land mines are going
to start exploding more often

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:00.303
on the civilian side.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.803
That's the reason why I decided to join

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.414
the Computer Science Department at NYU,

00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:09.127
along with Professor Claudio Silva

00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.868
to start to develop an app
called MineSafe.

00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:17.169
MineSafe uses information
from the community

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.871
to suggest paths that have been declared
as the most transited

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:26.529
without accident or incident
caused by a land mine.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:30.662
These traffic patterns
can also be used to determine

00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:33.974
the top priority zones to be de-mined.

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:40.047
Almost 15 million people are living now
in the countryside of Colombia.

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:45.587
Imagine, for a moment, if we can
crowdsource information from all of them

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.681
to help people like Adriana
and her children

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.198
to find safe and reliable paths.

00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:53.613
This information
can not only be used for that.

00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:57.675
This information can also help them
to become more productive.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.509
Farmers will be able to find

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.546
which lands have been cleared
from explosive devices,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.833
and in that way, they will be able
to find new, fertile grounds

00:05:09.857 --> 00:05:11.284
to start growing food again.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:16.555
MineSafe has now a partnership
with the Colombian government

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.372
for the initial pilot,

00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:22.634
and we have now some connections
with Cambodia and Somalia as well.

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:25.889
This project is being funded
by private money

00:05:25.913 --> 00:05:27.835
here in the United States,

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:29.684
but we don't want to stop here.

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:31.232
We want to go big,

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:34.579
and we want to scale the project
to every single place

00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:36.349
where land mines are still a threat.

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:43.231
The Colombian armed conflict
is finally coming to an end,

00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:47.986
but the consequences of years of war
are still buried under our feet.

00:05:48.887 --> 00:05:54.167
We at MineSafe are working
to help both people and land

00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.434
to find peace.

00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:56.999
Thank you.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:02.420
(Applause)
