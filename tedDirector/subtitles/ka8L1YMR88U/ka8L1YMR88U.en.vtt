00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So that's Johnny Depp, of course.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Some of you might know that, in 1990,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and he had tattooed on his right shoulder

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
"Winona forever."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And then three years later --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
they broke up,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So like Johnny Depp,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and like 25 percent of Americans

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
between the ages of 16 and 50,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I have a tattoo.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
but I deliberately waited a really long time.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Because we all know people

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
who have gotten tattoos when they were 17

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
or 19 or 23

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and regretted it by the time they were 30.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
That didn't happen to me.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I got my tattoo when I was 29,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and I regretted it instantly.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And by "regretted it,"

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
this is just a couple miles from here

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
down on the Lower East Side --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
(Laughter)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
(Laughter)

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
which I'll say more about in a minute.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And this was all actually quite shocking to me,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
because prior to this moment,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I had prided myself

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
on having absolutely no regrets.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I made a lot of mistakes

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and dumb decisions, of course.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I do that hourly.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But I had always felt like, look, you know,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I made the best choice I could make

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
given who I was then,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
given the information I had on hand.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I learned a lesson from it.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And okay, I wouldn't change it.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
is an absolute waste of time,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that we should always look forward and not backward,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and that one of the noblest and best things we can do

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
is strive to live a life free of regrets.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
This idea is nicely captured by this quote:

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
"Things without all remedy

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
should be without regard;

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
what's done is done."

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first --

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
something we might all agree to sign onto ...

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
until I tell you who said it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Right, so this is Lady MacBeth

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
for feeling bad about murdering people.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
as he generally was.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Because the inability to experience regret

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
of sociopaths.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So people who have damage

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to their orbital frontal cortex

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
seem to be unable to feel regret

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
there is an option open to you.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
It's called a lobotomy.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
But if you want to be fully functional

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and fully human

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and fully humane,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
So let's start off by defining some terms.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
What is regret?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Regret is the emotion we experience

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
when we think that our present situation

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
could be better or happier

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
if we had done something different in the past.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So in other words, regret requires two things.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And second of all, it requires imagination.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
the more agency and the more imagination

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
with respect to a given regret,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
the more acute that regret will be.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So let's say for instance

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and you finally arrive at your gate

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and you've missed your flight.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
You're going to experience more regret in that situation

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
if you missed your flight by three minutes

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
than if you missed it by 20.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Why?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
it is painfully easy to imagine

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
that you could have made different decisions

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
that would have led to a better outcome.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I should have gone through that yellow light."

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
These are the classic conditions that create regret.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We feel regret when we think we are responsible

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
for a decision that came out badly,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
but almost came out well.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Now within that framework,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
This session today is about behavioral economics.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And most of what we know about regret

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
comes to us out of that domain.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
We have a vast body of literature

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
on consumer and financial decisions

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and the regrets associated with them --

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
buyer's remorse, basically.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and say, well okay, but overall,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
what do we regret most in life?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Here's what the answers turn out to look like.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
So top six regrets --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the things we regret most in life:

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Number one by far, education.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
33 percent of all of our regrets

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
pertain to decisions we made about education.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
We wish we'd gotten more of it.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Others very high on our list of regrets

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
include career, romance, parenting,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
various decisions and choices about our sense of self

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and how we spend our leisure time --

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
or actually more specifically,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
how we fail to spend our leisure time.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
The remaining regrets

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
pertain to these things:

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
health, friends,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
spirituality and community.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So in other words, we know most of what we know about regret

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
by the study of finance.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.260
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So if you're sitting there stressing

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
about large cap versus small cap,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
or company A versus company B,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
you know what, let it go.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Odds are, you're not going to care in five years.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But for these things that we actually do really care about

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and do experience profound regret around,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
what does that experience feel like?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We all know the short answer.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
But it turns out that regret feels awful

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
in four very specific and consistent ways.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So the first consistent component of regret

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is basically denial.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
I basically stayed up all night.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And for the first several hours,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
there was exactly one thought in my head.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And the thought was,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
"Make it go away!"

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We're not trying to solve the problem.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
We just want it to vanish.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
The second characteristic component of regret

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
is a sense of bewilderment.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
was, "How could I have done that?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
What was I thinking?"

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
This real sense of alienation

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
from the part of us that made a decision we regret.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We can't identify with that part.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
We don't understand that part.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
which explains the third consistent component of regret,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
That's why, in the face of our regret,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
the thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The fourth component here

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
on the exact same thing.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Now the effect of perseveration

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is to basically take these first three components of regret

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and put them on an infinite loop.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
thinking, "Make it go away."

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It's that I sat there and I thought,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
"Make it go away. Make it go away.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Make it go away. Make it go away."

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
So if you look at the psychological literature,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
these are the four consistent defining components of regret.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And I think of this

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
as a kind of existential wake-up call.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
That night in my apartment,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
after I got done kicking myself and so forth,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
I lay in bed for a long time,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and I thought about skin grafts.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And then I thought about how,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.260
probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
The whole point of acts of idiocy

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
is that they leave you totally uninsured;

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
they leave you exposed to the world

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.260
in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
in the grips of what I sometimes think of

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
as a Control-Z culture --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Control-Z like the computer command,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
undo.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
We're incredibly used to not having to face

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
life's hard realities, in a certain sense.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
We think we can throw money at the problem

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
or throw technology at the problem --

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
we can undo and unfriend

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and unfollow.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that we desperately want to change

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and we cannot.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Sometimes instead of Control-Z,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
we actually have zero control.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and I know where of I speak --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
this is really hard,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Now there is a case to be made

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
But first I want to say

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
that the intensity and persistence

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
with which we experience these emotional components of regret

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
is obviously going to vary

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So for instance, here's one of my favorite

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.260
automatic generators of regret in modern life.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
(Laughter)

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Text: Relpy to all.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And the amazing thing

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
about this really insidious technological innovation

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
is that even just with this one thing,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
we can experience a huge range of regret.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
You can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and torpedo a relationship.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.260
Or you can have your last day at work.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And this doesn't even touch

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
on the really profound regrets of a life.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that have irrevocable and terrible consequences,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
either for our own or for other people's

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
health and happiness and livelihoods,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Now obviously, those kinds of regrets

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
are incredibly piercing and enduring.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.260
can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
So how are we supposed to live with this?

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
I want to suggest that there's three things

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
that help us to make our peace with regret.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And the first of these

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
is to take some comfort in its universality.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
If you Google regret and tattoo,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
you will get 11.5 million hits.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
(Laughter)

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
The FDA estimates

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that of all the Americans who have tattoos,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
17 percent of us regret getting them.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
That is Johnny Depp and me

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and our seven million friends.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And that's just regret about tattoos.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
We are all in this together.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
is to laugh at ourselves.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
because you don't like your new tattoo.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
when it comes to these more profound regrets.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
I don't think that's the case though.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
All of us who've experienced regret

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.260
that contains real pain and real grief

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
understand that humor and even black humor

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
plays a crucial role in helping us survive.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
It connects the poles of our lives back together,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
the positive and the negative,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and it sends a little current of life back into us.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
is through the passage of time,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
which, as we know, heals all wounds --

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
except for tattoos, which are permanent.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
So it's been several years

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
since I got my own tattoo.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
And do you guys just want to see it?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
All right.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Actually, you know what, I should warn you,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
you're going to be disappointed.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Because it's actually not that hideous.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
on some indiscreet part of myself or something.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
When other people see my tattoo,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
for the most part they like how it looks.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
It's just that I don't like how it looks.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
But I'll let you see it anyway.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
This is my tattoo.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
I can guess what some of you are thinking.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
So let me reassure you about something.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Some of your own regrets

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.260
are also not as ugly as you think they are.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
I got this tattoo

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
because I spent most of my 20s

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
living outside the country and traveling.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And when I came and settled in New York afterward,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I was worried that I would forget

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Specifically the two things I learned about myself

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
that I most didn't want to forget

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
was how important it felt to keep exploring

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and, simultaneously, how important it is

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And what I loved about this image of the compass

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
in one simple image.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
Well it did.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.260
it reminds me constantly of something else instead.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
It actually reminds me

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
of the most important lesson regret can teach us,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
I possibly could have tattooed onto my body --

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
partly as a writer,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
but also just as a human being.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Here's the thing,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
if we have goals

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and dreams,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and we want to do our best,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and if we love people

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and we don't want to hurt them or lose them,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
we should feel pain when things go wrong.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.260
The point isn't to live without any regrets.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.260
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and that I want to leave you with today

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
is this:

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
We need to learn to love

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
the flawed, imperfect things

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
that we create

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and to forgive ourselves for creating them.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
It reminds us that we know we can do better.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
Thank you.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
(Applause)
