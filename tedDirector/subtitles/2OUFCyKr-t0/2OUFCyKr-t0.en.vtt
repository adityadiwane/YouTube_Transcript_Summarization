00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I was here about four years ago,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.160
talking about the relationship of design and happiness.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.160
At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I learned very few things in addition since

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
(Laughter) --

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.160
but made a whole number of them into projects since.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.160
"Everybody always thinks they are right."

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
They were combined in the media.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:06.160
"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
We're doing changing media.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
This is a projection that can see the viewer

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
as the viewer walks by.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.160
You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
We do them for our clients.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
They are commissioned.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
or pay for all the billboards or the production of these,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
so there's always a client attached to them.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
that's lined with fashion stores.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
"Worrying solves nothing."

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.160
"Money does not make me happy"

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription --

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
it was 12 following pages.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
It said, "Money does does make me happy."

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
into letting us wrap his building.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
it says, "does not make me happy."

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.160
We had a show that just came down last week in New York.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
We steamed up the windows permanently,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and every hour we had a different designer come in

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Massimo Vignelli.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Singapore was quite in discussion.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
This is a little spot that we filmed there

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.160
that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
because all of these sentiments --

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
some banal, some a bit more profound --

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
all originally had come out of my diary.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
And I do go often into the diary

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.160
and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
If it's -- see it for a long enough time,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
I actually do something about it.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.160
And the very last one is a billboard.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160
We let that lie around in the sun.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160
shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
so on day one the billboard said,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget."

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Three days later it faded, and a week later,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
no more complaining anywhere.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
(Laughter)

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Thank you so much.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160
(Applause)
