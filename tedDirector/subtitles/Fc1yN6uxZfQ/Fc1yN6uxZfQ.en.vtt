00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.156
I just want to share with you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.756
what I have been experiencing
over the last five years

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.076
in having the great privilege of traveling

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.316
to many of the poorest
countries in the world.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.236
This scene is one
I see all the time everywhere,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.396
and these young children
are looking at a smartphone,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.260
and the smartphone is having a huge impact
in even the poorest countries.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.556
I said to my team, you know,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.316
what I see is a rise in aspirations
all over the world.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.020
In fact, it seems to me
that there's a convergence of aspirations.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.156
And I asked a team of economists
to actually look into this.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.396
Is this true?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.236
Are aspirations converging
all around the world?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.516
So they looked at things like Gallup polls
about satisfaction in life

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.996
and what they learned was
that if you have access to the internet,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.116
your satisfaction goes up.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.540
But another thing happens
that's very important:

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.916
your reference income,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.596
the income to which you compare your own,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.076
also goes up.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.516
Now, if the reference income
of a nation, for example,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.916
goes up 10 percent

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.156
by comparing themselves to the outside,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.436
then on average,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.516
people's own incomes
have to go up at least five percent

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.076
to maintain the same
level of satisfaction.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.076
But when you get down
into the lower percentiles of income,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.316
your income has to go up much more

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.396
if the reference income
goes up 10 percent,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.996
something like 20 percent.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.516
And so with this rise of aspirations,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.356
the fundamental question is:

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.956
Are we going to have a situation

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.156
where aspirations
are linked to opportunity

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.916
and you get dynamism and economic growth,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.676
like that which happened
in the country I was born in, in Korea?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.940
Or are aspirations
going to meet frustration?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.420
This is a real concern,
because between 2012 and 2015,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.156
terrorism incidents
increased by 74 percent.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.436
The number of deaths from terrorism
went up 150 percent.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.316
Right now, two billion people

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.916
live in conditions
of fragility, conflict, violence,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.396
and by 2030, more than 60 percent
of the world's poor

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.820
will live in these situations
of fragility, conflict and violence.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.316
And so what do we do
about meeting these aspirations?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.036
Are there new ways of thinking

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.076
about how we can rise
to meet these aspirations?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.116
Because if we don't,
I'm extremely worried.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.476
Aspirations are rising as never before
because of access to the internet.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.996
Everyone knows how everyone else lives.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.916
Has our ability to meet those aspirations

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.356
risen as well?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.316
And just to get at the details of this,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.756
I want to share with you
my own personal story.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.796
This is not my mother,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.516
but during the Korean War,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.996
my mother literally took her own sister,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.916
her younger sister, on her back,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.356
and walked at least part of the way

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.260
to escape Seoul during the Korean War.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.996
Now, through a series of miracles,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.116
my mother and father both got
scholarships to go to New York City.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.756
They actually met in New York City
and got married in New York City.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.996
My father, too, was a refugee.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.396
At the age of 19, he left his family
in the northern part of the country,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.076
escaped through the border

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.780
and never saw his family again.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.596
Now, when they were married
and living in New York,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.556
my father was a waiter
at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.220
Their aspirations went up.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.676
They understood what it was like
to live in a place like New York City

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.900
in the 1950s.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.636
Well, my brother was born
and they came back to Korea,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.676
and we had what I remember
as kind of an idyllic life,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.156
but what was happening
in Korea at that time

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.356
was the country was one
of the poorest in the world

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.996
and there was political upheaval.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.556
There were demonstrations just down
the street from our house all the time,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.620
students protesting
against the military government.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.660
And at the time,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.956
the aspirations of the World Bank Group,
the organization I lead now,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.420
were extremely low for Korea.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.876
Their idea was that Korea would
find it difficult without foreign aid

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.780
to provide its people with more
than the bare necessities of life.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.756
So the situation is
Korea is in a tough position,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.636
my parents have seen
what life is like in the United States.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.036
They got married there.
My brother was born there.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.396
And they felt that in order
to give us an opportunity

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.996
to reach their aspirations for us,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.356
we had to go and come back
to the United States.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.676
Now, we came back.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.956
First we went to Dallas.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.676
My father did his dental degree
all over again.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.996
And then we ended up
moving to Iowa, of all places.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.756
We grew up in Iowa.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.156
And in Iowa, we went
through the whole course.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.636
I went to high school, I went to college.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.716
And then one day,
something that I'll never forget,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.476
my father picked me up
after my sophomore year in college,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.836
and he was driving me home,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.996
and he said, "Jim,
what are your aspirations?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.436
What do you want to study?
What do you want to do?"

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.676
And I said, "Dad," --

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.956
My mother actually was a philosopher,
and had filled us with ideas

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.316
about protest and social justice,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.996
and I said, "Dad, I'm going to study
political science and philosophy,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.580
and I'm going to become
part of a political movement."

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.796
My father, the Korean dentist,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.316
slowly pulled the car
over to the side of the road --

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.996
(Laughter)

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.716
He looked back at me, and he said,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.217
"Jim, you finish your medical residency,
you can study anything you want."

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:34.796
(Laughter)

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.756
Now, I've told this story
to a mostly Asian audience before.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.316
Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.556
Of course.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.436
(Laughter)

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.996
(Applause)

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.036
So, tragically,
my father died at a young age,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.516
30 years ago at the age of 57,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.036
what happens to be how old I am right now,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.276
and when he died in the middle
of my medical and graduate studies --

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.716
You see, I actually got around it
by doing medicine and anthropology.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.580
I studied both of them in graduate school.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.636
But then right about that time,
I met these two people,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.260
Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.796
And Paul and I were in the same program.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.396
We were studying medicine

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.156
and at the same time
getting our PhD's in anthropology.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.996
And we began to ask
some pretty fundamental questions.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.916
For people who have the great privilege
of studying medicine and anthropology --

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.076
I had come from parents who were refugees.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.556
Paul grew up literally
in a bus in a swamp in Florida.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.156
He liked to call himself "white trash."

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.076
And so we had this opportunity

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.316
and we said,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.796
what is it that we need to do?

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.556
Given our ridiculously
elaborate educations,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.916
what is the nature
of our responsibility to the world?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.196
And we decided that we needed
to start an organization.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.716
It's called Partners in Health.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.996
And by the way,
there's a movie made about that.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.876
(Applause)

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.116
There's a movie
that was just a brilliant movie

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.236
they made about it
called "Bending the Arc."

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.676
It launched at Sundance this past January.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.916
Jeff Skoll is here.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.876
Jeff is one of the ones
who made it happen.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.716
And we began to think
about what it would take for us

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.316
to actually have our aspirations
reach the level

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.596
of some of the poorest
communities in the world.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.796
This is my very first visit
to Haiti in 1988,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.156
and in 1988, we elaborated
a sort of mission statement,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.036
which is we are going to make
a preferential option for the poor

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.276
in health.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.836
Now, it took us a long time, and we
were graduate students in anthropology.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.476
We were reading up one side of Marx
and down the other.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.956
Habermas. Fernand Braudel.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.636
We were reading everything

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.716
and we had to come to a conclusion
of how are we going to structure our work?

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.596
So "O for the P," we called it,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.700
a preferential option for the poor.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.436
The most important thing
about a preferential option for the poor

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.700
is what it's not.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.436
It's not a preferential option
for your own sense of heroism.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.916
It's not a preferential option

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.516
for your own idea about
how to lift the poor out of poverty.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.436
It's not a preferential option
for your own organization.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.356
And the hardest of all,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.220
it's not a preferential option
for your poor.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.740
It's a preferential option for the poor.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.676
So what do you do?

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.556
Well, Haiti, we started building --

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.836
Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.540
is just focus on vaccination
and maybe a feeding program.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.500
But what the Haitians wanted
was a hospital.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.076
They wanted schools.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.956
They wanted to provide their children
with the opportunities

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.996
that they'd been hearing about
from others, relatives, for example,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.916
who had gone to the United States.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.540
They wanted the same kinds
of opportunities as my parents did.

00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:49.340
I recognized them.

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:52.156
And so that's what we did.
We built hospitals.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.996
We provided education.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.436
And we did everything we could
to try to give them opportunities.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.116
Now, my experience really became intense

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.396
at Partners in Health
in this community, Carabayllo,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.260
in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.236
And in this community,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.876
we started out by really just going
to people's homes and talking to people,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.156
and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic
of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.436
This is Melquiades.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.276
Melquiades was a patient at that time,
he was about 18 years old,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.180
and he had a very difficult form
of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.876
All of the gurus in the world,
the global health gurus,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.716
said it is not cost-effective
to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.693
It's too complicated. It's too expensive.

00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:41.556
You just can't do it. It can't be done.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.756
And in addition,
they were getting angry at us,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.316
because the implication was

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.716
if it could be done,
we would have done it.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.436
Who do you think you are?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.716
And the people that we fought with
were the World Health Organization

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.876
and probably the organization
we fought with most

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.436
was the World Bank Group.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.676
Now, we did everything we could

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.116
to convince Melquiades
to take his medicines,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.636
because it's really hard,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.516
and not once during the time of treatment
did Melquiades's family ever say,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.756
"Hey, you know, Melquiades
is just not cost-effective.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.916
Why don't you go on
and treat somebody else?"

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.236
(Laughter)

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.516
I hadn't seen Melquiades
for about 10 years

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.636
and when we had
our annual meetings in Lima, Peru

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.196
a couple of years ago,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.436
the filmmakers found him

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.396
and here is us getting together.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.140
(Applause)

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.876
He has become a bit of a media star
because he goes to the film openings,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.196
and he knows how to work an audience now.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.076
(Laughter)

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.236
But as soon as we won --

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.076
We did win. We won the argument.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.956
You should treat
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis --

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.420
we heard the same arguments
in the early 2000s about HIV.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.836
All of the leading global health
people in the world said

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.116
it is impossible
to treat HIV in poor countries.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.596
Too expensive, too complicated,
you can't do it.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.556
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.780
it's actually easier.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.476
And we were seeing patients like this.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.716
Joseph Jeune.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.156
Joseph Jeune also never mentioned
that he was not cost-effective.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.996
A few months of medicines,
and this is what he looked like.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.436
(Applause)

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.956
We call that the Lazarus Effect
of HIV treatment.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.276
Joseline came to us looking like this.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.556
This is what she looked like
a few months later.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.276
(Applause)

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.876
Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.876
was with the organizations
that kept saying it's not cost-effective.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.316
We were saying, no,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.236
preferential option for the poor
requires us to raise our aspirations

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.213
to meet those of the poor for themselves.

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:47.876
And they said, well, that's a nice thought
but it's just not cost-effective.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:54.436
So in the nerdy way
that we have operated Partners in Health,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.156
we wrote a book against,
basically, the World Bank.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.796
It says that because the World Bank

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.676
has focused so much
on just economic growth

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.476
and said that governments
have to shrink their budgets

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.556
and reduce expenditures
in health, education and social welfare --

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.556
we thought that was fundamentally wrong.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.436
And we argued with the World Bank.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.060
And then a crazy thing happened.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.756
President Obama nominated me
to be President of the World Bank.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.540
(Applause)

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.596
Now, when I went to do the vetting process
with President Obama's team,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.116
they had a copy of "Dying For Growth,"
and they had read every page.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.876
And I said, "OK, that's it, right?

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.436
You guys are going to drop me?"

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.876
He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK."

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.276
And I was nominated,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.916
and I walked through the door
of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.316
and that statement on the wall,
"Our dream is a world free of poverty."

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.316
A few months after that,
we actually turned it into a goal:

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.956
end extreme poverty by 2030,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.236
boost shared prosperity.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.436
That's what we do now
at the World Bank Group.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.436
I feel like I have brought
the preferential option for the poor

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.836
to the World Bank Group.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.340
(Applause)

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.556
But this is TED,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.156
and so I want to share
with you some concerns,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.340
and then make a proposal.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.476
The Fourth Industrial Revolution,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.596
now, you guys know
so much better than I do,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.476
but here's the thing that concerns me.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.036
What we hear about is job loss.
You've all heard that.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.676
Our own data suggest to us
that two thirds of all jobs,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.939
currently existing jobs
in developing countries,

00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:31.676
will be lost because of automation.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.836
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.036
Now, one of the ways
to make up for those jobs

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.716
is to turn community health workers
into a formal labor force.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.996
That's what we want to do.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.276
(Applause)

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.636
We think the numbers will work out,

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.436
that as health outcomes get better
and as people have formal work,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.196
we're going to be able to train them

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.476
with the soft-skills training
that you add to it

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.036
to become workers
that will have a huge impact,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.436
and that may be the one area
that grows the most.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.036
But here's the other thing
that bothers me:

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.956
right now it seems pretty clear to me
that the jobs of the future

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.836
will be more digitally demanding,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.796
and there is a crisis
in childhood stunting.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.396
So these are photos from Charles Nelson,
who shared these with us

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.876
from Harvard Medical School.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.676
And what these photos show
on the one side, on the left side,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.116
is a three-month-old who has been stunted:

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.676
not adequate nutrition,
not adequate stimulation.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.276
And on the other side,
of course, is a normal child,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.156
and the normal child
has all of these neuronal connections.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.636
Now, the neuronal connections
are important,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.876
because that is
the definition of human capital.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.596
Now, we know that we
can reduce these rates.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.996
We can reduce these rates
of childhood stunting quickly,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.476
but if we don't, India, for example,
with 38 percent childhood stunting,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.236
how are they going to compete
in the economy of the future

00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.116
if 40 percent of their future workers
cannot achieve educationally

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.876
and certainly we worry
about achieving economically

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.140
in a way that will help
the country as a whole grow.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.316
Now, what are we going to do?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.196
78 trillion dollars
is the size of the global economy.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.116
8.55 trillion dollars are sitting
in negative interest rate bonds.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.596
That means that you give
the German central bank your money

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.116
and then you pay them to keep your money.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.956
That's a negative interest rate bond.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.156
24.4 trillion dollars
in very low-earning government bonds.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.396
And 8 trillion literally sitting
in the hands of rich people

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.380
under their very large mattresses.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.796
What we are trying to do
is now use our own tools --

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.516
and just to get nerdy for a second,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.036
we're talking about
first-loss risk debt instruments,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.636
we're talking about derisking,
blended finance,

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.156
we're talking about
political risk insurance,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.396
credit enhancement --

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.356
all these things that I've now learned
at the World Bank Group

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.516
that rich people use every single day
to make themselves richer,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.276
but we haven't used aggressively enough
on behalf of the poor

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.916
to bring this capital in.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.780
(Applause)

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.236
So does this work?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.076
Can you actually bring
private-sector players into a country

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.476
and really make things work?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.356
Well, we've done it a couple of times.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.596
This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.796
It's a box-set solution
from the World Bank

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.236
where we come in
and we do all the things you need

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.116
to attract private-sector investors.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.716
And in this case, Zambia went
from having a cost of electricity

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.700
at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.996
and by just doing simple things,
doing the auction,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.516
changing some policies,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.516
we were able to bring the cost down.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.756
Lowest bid,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.236
25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.436
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents
a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.596
(Applause)

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.556
But here's my proposal for you.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.476
This is from a group called Zipline,

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.356
a cool company, and they
literally are rocket scientists.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.796
They figured out
how to use drones in Rwanda.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.036
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.996
that delivers blood
anywhere in the country

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.556
in less than an hour.

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.036
So we save lives,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.916
this program saved lives --

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:16.956
(Applause)

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.716
This program made money for Zipline

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.755
and this program saved
huge amounts of money for Rwanda.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.476
That's what we need,
and we need that from all of you.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.755
I'm asking you, carve out
a little bit of time in your brains

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.356
to think about the technology
that you work on,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.995
the companies that you start,
the design that you do.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.956
Think a little bit and work with us

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.276
to see if we can come up with these kinds
of extraordinary win-win solutions.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.660
I'm going to leave you
with one final story.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.996
I was in Tanzania,
and I was in a classroom.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.060
This is me with a classroom
of 11-year-olds.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.916
And I asked them, as I always do,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.996
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.756
Two raised their hands and said,

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.796
"I want to be President
of the World Bank."

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.636
(Laughter)

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.076
And just like you, my own team
and their teachers laughed.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.636
But then I stopped them.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.700
I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.340
When I was born in South Korea,
this is what it looked like.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.340
This is where I came from.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.060
And when I was three years old,

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.260
in preschool,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.516
I don't think that George David Woods,
the President of the World Bank,

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.116
if he had visited Korea on that day
and come to my classroom,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.476
that he would have thought

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.516
that the future President
of the World Bank

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.996
was sitting in that classroom.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.316
Don't let anyone ever tell you

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.116
that you cannot be
President of the World Bank."

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.356
Now -- thank you.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.956
(Applause)

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.620
Let me leave you with one thought.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.716
I came from a country
that was the poorest in the world.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.316
I'm President of the World Bank.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.516
I cannot and I will not
pull up the ladder behind me.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.076
This is urgent.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.596
Aspirations are going up.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.916
Everywhere aspirations are going up.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.556
You folks in this room, work with us.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.596
We know that we can find
those Zipline-type solutions

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.916
and help the poor
leapfrog into a better world,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.540
but it won't happen
until we work together.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.796
The future "you" --
and especially for your children --

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.396
the future you

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.396
will depend on how much care
and compassion we bring

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.036
to ensuring that the future "us"
provides equality of opportunity

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.476
for every child in the world.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.756
Thank you very much.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.476
(Applause)

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.556
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.660
(Applause)

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.516
Chris Anderson: You'd almost think

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.676
people are surprised
to hear a talk like this

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.516
from the President of the World Bank.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.756
It's kind of cool.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.036
I'd encourage you to even be
a little more specific on your proposal.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.556
There's many investors,
entrepreneurs in this room.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.076
How will you partner with them?
What's your proposal?

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.356
Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy
for just a second.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.956
CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.
JYK: So here's what we did.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.276
Insurance companies never invest
in developing country infrastructure,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.476
for example, because
they can't take the risk.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.116
They're holding money
for people who pay for insurance.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.276
So what we did was a Swedish
International Development Association

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.756
gave us a little bit of money,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.916
we went out and raised a little bit
more money, a hundred million,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.556
and we took first loss,
meaning if this thing goes bad,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.436
10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.236
and the rest of you will be safe.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.996
And that created
a 90-percent chunk, tranche

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.476
that was triple B, investment-grade,
so the insurance companies invested.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.116
So for us, what we're doing
is taking our public money

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.676
and using it to derisk
specific instruments

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.436
to bring people in from the outside.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.396
So all of you who are sitting
on trillions of dollars of cash,

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.636
come to us. Right?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.676
(Laughter)

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.956
CA: And what you're specifically
looking for are investment proposals

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.196
that create employment
in the developing world.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.596
JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.356
So these will be, for example,
in infrastructure that brings energy,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.836
builds roads, bridges, ports.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.596
These kinds of things
are necessary to create jobs,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.916
but also what we're saying is

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.356
you may think that the technology
you're working on

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.236
or the business that you're working on

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.316
may not have applications
in the developing world,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.676
but look at Zipline.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.716
And that Zipline thing didn't happen

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.916
just because of the quality
of the technology.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.116
It was because they engaged
with the Rwandans early

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.996
and used artificial intelligence --

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.876
one thing, Rwanda has great broadband --

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.756
but these things fly
completely on their own.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.636
So we will help you do that.
We will make the introductions.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.356
We will even provide financing.
We will help you do that.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.036
CA: How much capital
is the World Bank willing to deploy

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.596
to back those kinds of efforts?

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.916
JYK: Chris, you're always getting me
to try to do something like this.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.516
CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.
JYK: So here's what we're going to do.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.276
We have 25 billion a year
that we're investing in poor countries,

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.516
the poorest countries.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.596
And as we invest
over the next three years,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.036
25 billion a year,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.916
we have got to think with you

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.076
about how to use that money
more effectively.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.916
So I can't give you a specific number.
It depends on the quality of the ideas.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.476
So bring us your ideas,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.660
and I don't think that financing
is going to be the problem.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.556
CA: All right, you heard it
from the man himself.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.796
Jim, thanks so much.
JYK: Thank you. Thank you.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.220
(Applause)
