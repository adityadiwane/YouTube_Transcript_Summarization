00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
when I was between seven and 10 years old.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:38.160
were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.160
how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.160
satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
was destroyed by the war.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
So I became interested in understanding

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.160
what contributed to a life that was worth living.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.160
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.160
and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
that I could see as a possible answer to that question.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.160
to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.160
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.160
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Instead of talking about little green men,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.160
he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160
had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
flying saucers into the sky.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.160
were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
some sense of order after the chaos of war.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And this seemed very interesting to me.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And I started reading his books after that lecture.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.160
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
Then I came to this country to study psychology

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.160
and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.160
This is a typical result that many people have presented,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
and there are many variations on it.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
surveyed in the United States since 1956

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
say that their life is very happy.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And that hasn't changed at all.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Whereas the personal income,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.160
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
But you find essentially the same results,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.160
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.160
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
material resources, contributes to unhappiness,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.160
but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
So my research has been focused more on --

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.160
after finding out these things that actually corresponded

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
to my own experience, I tried to understand:

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.160
where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
do we feel really happy?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And to start

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.160
first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:19.160
what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.160
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.160
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
And the interview was 40 pages long.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
But this little excerpt is a very good summary

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
of what he was saying during the interview.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
Now, "ecstasy" in Greek meant

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
simply to stand to the side of something.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.160
where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.160
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.160
the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.160
whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.160
or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.160
is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
We know the temples they built, where people could come

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
to experience a different reality.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
We know about the circuses,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
the arenas, the theaters.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:05.160
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:14.160
to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
We are participating in a reality that is different

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
from that of the everyday life that we're used to.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
But this man doesn't need to go there.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.160
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.160
and as he does that, he can imagine sounds

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
that had not existed before in that particular combination.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.160
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
like Jennifer did in her improvisation,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160
a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
he enters that different reality.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.160
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160
more than about 110 bits of information per second.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.160
you need to process about 60 bits per second.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
That's why you can't hear more than two people.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
of creating something new, as this man is,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.160
he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
how his body feels, or his problems at home.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
His body disappears,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.160
his identity disappears from his consciousness,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.160
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
and at the same time to feel that he exists.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.160
So existence is temporarily suspended.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.160
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:51.160
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
So what it's telling you here

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:04.160
is that obviously this automatic,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
who is very well trained and who has developed technique.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:20.160
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.160
of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:44.160
to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
than what was there before.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Now, when that happens,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
he says the music just flows out.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And because all of these people I started interviewing --

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
this was an interview which is over 30 years old --

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
And it happens in different realms.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
This is by a student of mine who interviewed

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.160
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.160
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.160
as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.160
when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.160
But it happens in other activities.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
For instance, this is another student of mine,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
with some of the leading athletes in the world.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
the same essential description of the phenomenology

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
of the inner state of the person.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
You don't think; it goes automatically,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.160
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
and very ethical, very socially responsible.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
You see that these people define success

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
as something that helps others and at the same time

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
makes you feel happy as you are working at it.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:54.160
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.160
you can't have just one of these things be successful

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
if you want a meaningful and successful job.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.160
She is the founder of Body Shop,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
the natural cosmetics king.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
It's kind of a passion that comes

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
from doing the best and having flow while you're working.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
without a product -- they didn't have a product,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.160
can feel the joy of technological innovation,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.160
be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
I couldn't improve on this as a good example

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
of how flow enters the workplace.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.160
Now, when we do studies --

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.160
we have, with other colleagues around the world,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.160
done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:16.160
to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
who enjoy their work.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
And regardless of the culture,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:27.160
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.160
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
you get immediate feedback.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
You know that what you need to do

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
is possible to do, even though difficult,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
you feel part of something larger.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And once the conditions are present,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.160
what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:09.160
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160
And we can measure this very precisely, actually,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
where you are, what you're thinking about.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
people experience at that moment and the amount of skill

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
that they feel they have at that moment.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
So for each person we can establish an average,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
which is the center of the diagram.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
which will be different from that of anybody else.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
If we know what that set point is,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160
we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160
and it will be when your challenges are higher than average

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
and skills are higher than average.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.160
And you may be doing things very differently from other people,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
will be when you are doing what you really like to do --

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.160
play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.160
if work is what provides flow for you.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.160
And then the other areas become less and less positive.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.160
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160
but you can move into flow fairly easily

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
by just developing a little more skill.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.160
because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
and to enter that -- going back to flow --

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
then they develop higher skills.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
Control is also a good place to be,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.160
because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
It's not very challenging any more.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
And if you want to enter flow from control,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
you have to increase the challenges.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160
So those two are ideal and complementary areas

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
from which flow is easy to go into.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
The other combinations of challenge and skill

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
become progressively less optimal.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.160
Boredom begins to be very aversive

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.160
and apathy becomes very negative:

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.160
you don't feel that you're doing anything,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.160
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:56.160
The largest single contributor to that experience

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.160
is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.160
Even though sometimes watching television

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.160
about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
and you get feedback from it.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.160
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.160
is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.160
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.160
without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.160
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160
Thank you.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160
