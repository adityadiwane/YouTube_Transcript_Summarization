00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:31.407
(Music)

00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:50.719
(Applause)

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.834
Thank you.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.525
Hi, everybody.

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.644
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.478
I'd like to share with you a little bit of me

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:03.590
playing my life.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.279
I might look successful and happy

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.377
being in front of you today,

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:11.463
but I once suffered from severe depression

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:13.828
and was in total despair.

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:16.933
The violin, which meant everything to me,

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.510
became a grave burden on me.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.236
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:27.161
their words sounded like meaningless noise.

00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.523
When I was just about to give everything up

00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.886
after years of suffering,

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:38.427
I started to rediscover the true power of music.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:53.316
(Music)

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.776
In the midst of hardship,

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:08.266
it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.035
The comfort the music gave me

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:11.745
was just indescribable,

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:15.909
and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.213
and it totally changed my perspective on life

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:21.869
and set me free from the pressure

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:26.807
of becoming a successful violinist.

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:29.946
Do you feel like you are all alone?

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:33.505
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,

00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:36.016
as it did for me.

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:41.981
(Music)

00:06:52.051 --> 00:07:00.758
(Applause)

00:07:00.758 --> 00:07:02.503
Thank you.

00:07:02.503 --> 00:07:06.440
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.119
and have found there are no boundaries.

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.678
My audience is anyone who is here to listen,

00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:16.926
even those who are not familiar with classical music.

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:21.775
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.710
like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.501
but also hospitals, churches, prisons,

00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:31.721
and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,

00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:33.687
just to mention a few.

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:38.297
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you

00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:41.978
that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:44.782
and that it can rock you.

00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:48.210
Let me introduce you to my brand new project,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.715
"Baroque in Rock,"

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:53.407
which became a golden disc most recently.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.904
It's such an honor for me.

00:07:55.904 --> 00:08:00.145
I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:04.778
I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.

00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:08.345
But it's now your turn.

00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:09.816
Changing your perspectives

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:13.764
will not only transform you but also the whole world.

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:16.247
Just play your life with all you have,

00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:18.581
and share it with the world.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.406
I really look forward to witnessing

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:24.351
a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:29.394
Play your life, and stay tuned.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:37.522
(Music)

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:23.179
(Applause)
