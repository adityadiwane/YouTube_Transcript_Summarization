00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.008
Hi. I am an architect.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.456
I am the only architect in the world

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.772
making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.338
and this exhibition is the first one I did

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:23.846
using paper tubes.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:28.271
1986, much, much longer before people started talking

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:32.474
about ecological issues and environmental issues,

00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:35.764
I just started testing the paper tube

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.499
in order to use this as a building structure.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.652
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.150
but this is much stronger than I expected,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.362
and also it's very easy to waterproof,

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.257
and also, because it's industrial material,

00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:52.960
it's also possible to fireproof.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.793
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.

00:00:56.793 --> 00:00:59.800
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.870
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.512
there are only 12 tubes with a diameter

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:08.282
of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:10.902
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:13.553
In case you're finished with toilet paper,

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:15.873
you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)

00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:18.265
So it's very useful.

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:22.304
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.

00:01:22.304 --> 00:01:24.923
I was asked to design the building,

00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:27.717
because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:32.205
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:33.932
recyclable paper.

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:36.902
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:38.986
My goal was when the building was demolished,

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:42.962
because each country makes a lot of pavilions

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:46.062
but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:50.743
so my building has to be reused or recycled.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.846
After, the building was recycled.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.492
So that was the goal of my design.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:58.580
Then I was very lucky to win the competition

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.238
to build the second Pompidou Center in France

00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:02.713
in the city of Metz.

00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:04.209
Because I was so poor,

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.376
I wanted to rent an office in Paris,

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.893
but I couldn't afford it,

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.934
so I decided to bring my students to Paris

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.450
to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.685
by ourselves.

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:18.014
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:22.099
to complete the 35-meter-long office.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.133
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:29.004
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.391
Thank you. I had one big problem.

00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:33.745
Because we were part of the exhibition,

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:37.049
even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.252
That was the problem.

00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:42.020
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.974
It's a very popular museum now,

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:47.140
and I created a big monument for the government.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.039
But then I was very disappointed

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.635
at my profession as an architect,

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:55.663
because we are not helping, we are not working for society,

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.907
but we are working for privileged people,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.099
rich people, government, developers.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.619
They have money and power.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.416
Those are invisible.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:10.244
So they hire us to visualize their power and money

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:12.462
by making monumental architecture.

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:14.642
That is our profession, even historically it's the same,

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:16.994
even now we are doing the same.

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:20.318
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,

00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:24.305
even though there are so many people

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.212
who lost their houses by natural disasters.

00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:30.255
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:33.240
For example, earthquakes never kill people,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.413
but collapse of the buildings kill people.

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:37.453
That's the responsibility of architects.

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.190
Then people need some temporary housing,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.852
but there are no architects working there

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:44.512
because we are too busy working for privileged people.

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:48.391
So I thought, even as architects,

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:53.147
we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:54.939
We can make it better.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.972
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:02.698
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:05.430
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.928
Over two million people became refugees.

00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:11.679
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.913
organized by the U.N.

00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:17.207
They're so poor, and they are freezing

00:04:17.207 --> 00:04:19.330
with blankets during the rainy season,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.085
In the shelters built by the U.N.,

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.391
they were just providing a plastic sheet,

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:28.540
and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.306
But over two million people cut trees.

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:33.097
It just became big, heavy deforestation

00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:34.830
and an environmental problem.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.060
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.347
Very expensive, they throw them out for money,

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.273
then cutting trees again.

00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:46.294
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation

00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:48.454
using these recycled paper tubes

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.387
because this is so cheap and also so strong,

00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:54.134
but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.

00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:57.095
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test

00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:02.801
for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:07.381
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:09.174
we had a big earthquake.

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.686
Nearly 7,000 people were killed,

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.677
and the city like this Nagata district,

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:17.995
all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.

00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:21.936
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees

00:05:21.936 --> 00:05:24.531
suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --

00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:26.450
all the building was totally destroyed.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.951
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,

00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.569
"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.709
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.818
After a fire, what are you proposing?"

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:41.446
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:43.328
I started commuting to Kobe,

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:45.957
and I met the society of Vietnamese people.

00:05:45.957 --> 00:05:48.624
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets

00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:49.905
in the park.

00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:53.147
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.

00:05:53.147 --> 00:05:55.703
I made a paper tube shelter for them,

00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:58.661
and in order to make it easy to be built by students

00:05:58.661 --> 00:06:00.244
and also easy to demolish,

00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:03.453
I used beer crates as a foundation.

00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:06.043
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:08.763
because at that time, the Asahi beer company

00:06:08.763 --> 00:06:10.775
made their plastic beer crates red,

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.189
which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.507
The color coordination is very important.

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:18.700
And also I still remember, we were expecting

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.055
to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:22.949
but it came empty. (Laughter)

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.341
So I remember it was so disappointing.

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.579
So during the summer with my students,

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.765
we built over 50 units of the shelters.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.536
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.

00:06:33.536 --> 00:06:35.827
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,

00:06:35.827 --> 00:06:38.081
bring your students to build, you can do it."

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:40.564
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.

00:06:40.564 --> 00:06:44.062
It was meant to stay there for three years,

00:06:44.062 --> 00:06:47.360
but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.169
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.119
and we proposed to donate this church,

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.720
so we dismantled them,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.965
we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.

00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:02.589
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.080
So this building became a permanent building.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.729
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.662
Even a building made in paper

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:15.192
can be permanent as long as people love it.

00:07:15.192 --> 00:07:17.488
Even a concrete building can be very temporary

00:07:17.488 --> 00:07:19.505
if that is made to make money.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.215
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:26.365
I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.

00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:30.219
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:34.300
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.981
and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.

00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:43.432
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,

00:07:43.432 --> 00:07:46.358
nearly 70,000 people were killed,

00:07:46.358 --> 00:07:49.443
and also especially many of the schools were destroyed

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:52.893
because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.

00:07:52.893 --> 00:07:55.861
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.

00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:59.647
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.

00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:02.508
In one month, we completed nine classrooms,

00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:04.160
over 500 square meters.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.632
It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.

00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:14.096
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:16.448
And this is a very interesting photo:

00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:19.165
former Prime Minister Berlusconi

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:23.583
and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:27.464
you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.

00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:32.426
And they are very kind, affording my model.

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:36.825
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:39.269
because L'Aquila is very famous for music

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.694
and all the concert halls were destroyed,

00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:42.826
so musicians were moving out.

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:44.253
So I proposed to the mayor,

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:46.488
I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.

00:08:46.488 --> 00:08:49.434
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."

00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:50.617
And I was very lucky.

00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:52.918
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,

00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:55.024
and our former prime minister came,

00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:58.229
so they helped us to collect money,

00:08:58.229 --> 00:09:01.072
and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:03.959
to rebuild this temporary auditorium.

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:08.679
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.270
but it's impossible to fly over,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.287
so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:16.202
to drive six hours to get to Haiti

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:19.493
with the local students in Santo Domingo

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:22.946
to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.

00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:26.559
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.434
After the earthquake and tsunami,

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:32.221
people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.

00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:34.122
But look at this. There's no privacy.

00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:36.989
People suffer mentally and physically.

00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:40.380
So we went there to build partitions

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.643
with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,

00:09:43.643 --> 00:09:47.874
just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.

00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:50.390
However, some of the facility authority

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.437
doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,

00:09:52.437 --> 00:09:55.634
simply, it's become more difficult to control them.

00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:58.116
But it's really necessary to do it.

00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.621
They don't have enough flat area to build

00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:03.906
standard government single-story housing like this one.

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:06.156
Look at this. Even civil government is doing

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:10.285
such poor construction of the temporary housing,

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:16.816
so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:20.085
so I thought, we have to make multi-story building

00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:23.110
because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:28.040
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.671
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village

00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:32.991
in Miyagi.

00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:37.377
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:40.103
I used the shipping container

00:10:40.103 --> 00:10:42.556
and also the students helped us to make

00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:45.354
all the building furniture

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:47.046
to make them comfortable,

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.321
within the budget of the government

00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.230
but also the area of the house is exactly the same,

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.370
but much more comfortable.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.502
Many of the people want to stay here forever.

00:10:57.502 --> 00:11:00.064
I was very happy to hear that.

00:11:00.064 --> 00:11:04.001
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.

00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:07.848
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,

00:11:07.848 --> 00:11:09.353
also they had a big earthquake,

00:11:09.353 --> 00:11:11.914
and many Japanese students were also killed,

00:11:11.914 --> 00:11:14.233
and the most important cathedral of the city,

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:17.004
the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.

00:11:17.004 --> 00:11:21.102
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.

00:11:21.102 --> 00:11:23.389
So this is under construction.

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:26.729
And I'd like to keep building monuments

00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:28.959
that are beloved by people.

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:30.398
Thank you very much.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.334
(Applause)

00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:35.067
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:37.824
Thank you very much. (Applause)
