00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.293
When I was a kid,

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:17.825
I experienced something so powerful,

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.923
I spent the rest of my life
searching for it,

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:22.459
and in all the wrong places.

00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:25.920
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:27.816
It was music.

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.547
And this is where the story begins.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.167
That's me,

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.137
listening to the Beatles' "White Album."

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:38.329
And the look on my face is the feeling

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:41.099
that I've been searching for ever since.

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:44.524
Music goes straight to the emotional vein,

00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:46.154
into your bloodstream

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:47.509
and right into your heart.

00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:50.678
It deepens every experience.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.883
Fellas?

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:57.672
(Music)

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:01.624
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:03.527
and Joshua Roman.

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:04.714
Music --

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:05.932
(Applause)

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:07.114
Yeah.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.455
Music makes everything
have more emotional resonance.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.158
Let's see how it does for this talk.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.569
The right piece of music
at the right time fuses with us

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:20.918
on a cellular level.

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:23.662
When I hear that one song

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:25.805
from that one summer

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:27.665
with that one girl,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.501
I'm instantly transported
back there again.

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:33.130
Hey, Stacey.

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:38.186
Here's a part of the story, though,
where I got a little greedy.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.808
I thought if I added more layers
on top of the music,

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.646
I could make the feelings
even more powerful.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.504
So I got into directing music videos.

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:50.906
This is what they looked like.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.672
That's my brother, Jeff.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.121
Sorry about this, Jeff.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:01:59.232
(Laughter)

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.203
Here's me, just so we're even.

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:03.885
Incredible moves.

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:05.785
Should've been a dancer.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:06.931
(Laughter)

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:08.267
These experiments grew,

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.075
and in time, started
to look more like this.

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.492
In both, I'm searching
for the same thing, though,

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.175
to capture that lightning in a bottle.

00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:21.865
Except, I'm not.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.448
Adding moving pictures over the music
added narrative dimension, yes,

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.785
but never quite equated the power

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.553
that just raw music had for me on its own.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:35.949
This is not a great thing to realize
when you've devoted your life

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:38.812
and professional career
to becoming a music video director.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:41.137
I kept asking myself,
did I take the wrong path?

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:46.204
So I started thinking: if I could
involve you, the audience, more,

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.230
I might be able to make you
feel something more as well.

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:53.086
So Aaron Koblin and I began
auditioning new technologies

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.248
that could put more of you
inside of the work,

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:59.906
like your childhood home
in "The Wilderness Downtown,"

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.510
your hand-drawn portraits,
in "The Johnny Cash Project,"

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:06.981
and your interactive dreams

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.488
in "3 Dreams of Black."

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.426
We were pushing beyond the screen,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.431
trying to connect more deeply

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.832
to people's hearts and imaginations.

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.091
But it wasn't quite enough.

00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:26.057
It still didn't have the raw
experiential power of pure music for me.

00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:29.504
So I started chasing a new technology

00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:32.227
that I only had read about
in science fiction.

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.235
And after years of searching,
I found a prototype.

00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:40.095
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña
in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:44.170
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:46.587
I could taste the lightning.

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:48.984
It was called virtual reality.

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:52.303
This was it five years ago
when I ran into it.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.592
This is what it looks like now.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:00.751
I quickly started building things
in this new medium,

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.992
and through that process
we realized something:

00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:07.081
that VR is going to play
an incredibly important role

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:08.820
in the history of mediums.

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.398
In fact, it's going to be the last one.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.005
I mean this because it's the first medium
that actually makes the jump

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.317
from our internalization
of an author's expression

00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:22.011
of an experience,

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:24.687
to our experiencing it firsthand.

00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.855
You look confused.
I'll explain. Don't worry.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.273
(Laughter)

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.020
If we go back to the origins of mediums,

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:34.408
by all best guesses,

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.398
it starts around a fire,
with a good story.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.451
Our clan leader is telling us

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:43.104
about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
on the tundra that day.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.408
We hear his words

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.363
and translate them
into our own internal truths.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.004
The same thing happens

00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:54.670
when we look at the cave painting
version of the story,

00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:57.824
the book about the mammoth hunt,

00:04:58.472 --> 00:04:59.706
the play,

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:01.295
the radio broadcast,

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:02.914
the television show

00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:04.737
or the movie.

00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:09.264
All of these mediums require
what we call "suspension of disbelief,"

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:13.346
because there's a translation gap
between the reality of the story

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.792
and our consciousness
interpreting the story

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.084
into our reality.

00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:23.157
I'm using the word "consciousness"
as a feeling of reality that we get

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:26.517
from our senses experiencing
the world around us.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.377
Virtual reality bridges that gap.

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:36.198
Now, you are on the tundra
hunting with the clan leader.

00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:38.576
Or you are the clan leader.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.302
Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:42.961
(Laughter)

00:05:46.218 --> 00:05:47.830
So here's what special about VR.

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:50.305
In all other mediums,

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.599
your consciousness interprets the medium.

00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:57.214
In VR, your consciousness is the medium.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.833
So the potential for VR is enormous.

00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:02.531
But where are we now?

00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:05.141
What is the current state of the art?

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:07.468
Well,

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:09.935
we are here.

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:13.872
We are the equivalent
of year one of cinema.

00:06:13.896 --> 00:06:15.522
This is the Lumière Brothers film

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:18.905
that allegedly sent a theater full
of people running for their lives

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:21.222
as they thought a train
was coming toward them.

00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:25.412
Similar to this early stage
of this medium,

00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:28.977
in VR, we also have to move
past the spectacle

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.887
and into the storytelling.

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:32.658
It took this medium decades

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:35.340
to figure out its preferred
language of storytelling,

00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:37.140
in the form of a feature film.

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.518
In VR today, we're more learning grammar

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:41.833
than writing language.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.431
We've made 15 films in the last year
at our VR company, Vrse,

00:06:46.455 --> 00:06:48.072
and we've learned a few things.

00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.116
We found that we have a unique,
direct path into your senses,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.949
your emotions, even your body.

00:06:55.897 --> 00:06:57.572
So let me show you some things.

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:58.994
For the purpose of this demo,

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:02.083
we're going to take every direction
that you could possibly look,

00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:04.320
and stretch it into this giant rectangle.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.033
OK, here we go.

00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:13.923
So, first: camera movement
is tricky in VR.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:16.049
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.429
We found if you move the camera
at a constant speed in a straight line,

00:07:21.453 --> 00:07:23.670
you can actually get away with it, though.

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.421
The first day in film school,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.032
they told me you have to learn
every single rule

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:29.814
before you can break one.

00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:32.012
We have not learned every single rule.

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:33.564
We've barely learned any at all,

00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:35.405
but we're already trying to break them

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:37.958
to see what kind of creative things
we can accomplish.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:41.694
In this shot here, where we're moving up
off the ground, I added acceleration.

00:07:41.718 --> 00:07:44.551
I did that because I wanted
to give you a physical sensation

00:07:44.575 --> 00:07:45.958
of moving up off the ground.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:48.475
In VR, I can give that to you.

00:07:49.797 --> 00:07:53.871
(Music)

00:07:55.882 --> 00:07:59.429
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot
in this medium as well.

00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:01.716
It guides us how to feel.

00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:05.675
In this project we made
with the New York Times, Zach Richter

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:07.454
and our friend, JR,

00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:09.363
we take you up in a helicopter,

00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:13.325
and even though you're flying
2,000 feet above Manhattan,

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:14.937
you don't feel afraid.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.869
You feel triumphant for JR's character.

00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:20.501
The music guides you there.

00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:22.525
(Music)

00:08:29.364 --> 00:08:30.971
Contrary to popular belief,

00:08:30.995 --> 00:08:33.661
there is composition in virtual reality,

00:08:33.685 --> 00:08:35.746
but it's completely
different than in film,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.495
where you have a rectangular frame.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.031
Composition is now
where your consciousness exists

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:42.002
and how the world moves around you.

00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:46.291
In this film, "Waves of Grace,"
which was a collaboration between Vrse,

00:08:46.315 --> 00:08:49.224
the United Nations, Gabo Arora,
and Imraan Ismail,

00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:52.490
we also see the changing role
of the close-up in virtual reality.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:57.352
A close-up in VR means
you're actually close up to someone.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.597
It brings that character inside
of your personal space,

00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:04.466
a space that we'd usually reserve
for the people that we love.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.660
And you feel an emotional
closeness to the character

00:09:07.684 --> 00:09:10.392
because of what you feel
to be a physical closeness.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.978
Directing VR is not like
directing for the rectangle.

00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:24.086
It's more of a choreography
of the viewer's attention.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.458
One tool we can use
to guide your attention

00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:28.915
is called "spatialized sound."

00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:31.907
I can put a sound anywhere
in front of you, to left or right,

00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:33.310
even behind you,

00:09:33.334 --> 00:09:36.330
and when you turn your head,
the sound will rotate accordingly.

00:09:36.354 --> 00:09:39.856
So I can use that to direct your attention
to where I want you to see.

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.886
Next time you hear someone
singing over your shoulder,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.171
it might be Bono.

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.402
(Laughter)

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:53.294
VR makes us feel
like we are part of something.

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:57.968
For most of human history,
we lived in small family units.

00:09:57.992 --> 00:09:59.503
We started in caves,

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:02.960
then moved to clans and tribes,
then villages and towns,

00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:05.676
and now we're all global citizens.

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:10.011
But I believe that we are still
hardwired to care the most

00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:12.532
about the things that are local to us.

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:18.283
And VR makes anywhere
and anyone feel local.

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:20.815
That's why it works as an empathy machine.

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:24.063
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra"
takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,

00:10:24.087 --> 00:10:28.638
and instead of watching a story
about people over there,

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:32.485
it's now a story about us here.

00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:35.896
But where do we go from here?

00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:38.889
The tricky thing is that
with all previous mediums,

00:10:38.913 --> 00:10:41.283
the format is fixed at its birth.

00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:44.071
Film has been a sequence of rectangles,

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:46.934
from Muybridge and his horses to now.

00:10:47.377 --> 00:10:48.927
The format has never changed.

00:10:49.654 --> 00:10:53.101
But VR as a format, as a medium,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.619
isn't complete yet.

00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:59.966
It's not using physical celluloid
or paper or TV signals.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.809
It actually employs what we use
to make sense of the world.

00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:08.545
We're using your senses
as the paints on the canvas,

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:09.891
but only two right now.

00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:15.493
Eventually, we can see if we will have
all of our human senses employed,

00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:19.712
and we will have agency to live
the story in any path we choose.

00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:23.031
And we call it virtual reality right now,

00:11:23.055 --> 00:11:25.849
but what happens when we move
past simulated realities?

00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:28.775
What do we call it then?

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:32.339
What if instead of verbally
telling you about a dream,

00:11:32.363 --> 00:11:35.137
I could let you live inside that dream?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.487
What if instead of just experiencing
visiting some reality on Earth,

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.937
you could surf gravitational waves
on the edge of a black hole,

00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:46.737
or create galaxies from scratch,

00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.845
or communicate with each other
not using words

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:51.772
but using our raw thoughts?

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.335
That's not a virtual reality anymore.

00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:58.398
And honestly I don't know
what that's called.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.216
But I hope you see where we're going.

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:06.351
But here I am, intellectualizing
a medium I'm saying is experiential.

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:08.265
So let's experience it.

00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:12.040
In your hands, you hopefully hold
a piece of cardboard.

00:12:13.143 --> 00:12:14.776
Let's open the flap.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.333
Tap on the power button
to unlock the phone.

00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:19.769
For the people watching at home,

00:12:19.793 --> 00:12:21.629
we're going to put up a card right now

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:24.883
to show you how to download
this experience on your phone yourself,

00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:28.208
and even get a Google cardboard
of your own to try it with.

00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:31.802
We played in cardboard boxes as kids,

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:36.410
and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find
a little bit of that lightning

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:39.208
by sticking our head in one again.

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:43.044
You're about to participate

00:12:43.068 --> 00:12:47.520
in the largest collective
VR viewing in history.

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:51.854
And in that classic old-timey
style of yesteryear,

00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:54.109
we're all going to watch something

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:56.130
at the exact same time, together.

00:12:57.019 --> 00:12:58.442
Let's hope it works.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:00.651
What's the countdown
look like? I can't see.

00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:11.558
Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:18.446
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

00:13:22.327 --> 00:13:26.155
(Birds singing)

00:13:34.508 --> 00:13:37.168
(Train engine)

00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:47.351
Audience: (Shreiks)

00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:04.575
(Video) JR: Let me tell you

00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:07.076
how I shot the cover
of the New York Times Magazine,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.194
"Walking New York."

00:14:18.577 --> 00:14:21.987
I just got strapped on
outside the helicopter,

00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:26.255
and I had to be perfectly
vertical so I could grab it.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.897
And when I was perfectly above --

00:14:27.921 --> 00:14:30.658
you know, with the wind,
we had to redo it a few times --

00:14:30.682 --> 00:14:32.476
then I kept shooting.

00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:41.296
(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.220
protect us from evil,

00:14:44.654 --> 00:14:45.865
for you are the Lord,

00:14:47.044 --> 00:14:48.231
the light.

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:56.207
You who gave us life took it away.

00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.771
Let your will be done.

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:05.505
Please bring peace to the many
who have lost loved ones.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:07.272
Help us to live again.

00:15:10.564 --> 00:15:13.683
(Music)

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:30.527
(Video) (Children's voices)

00:15:31.504 --> 00:15:36.169
Child's voice: There are more kids
in Zaatari than adults right now.

00:15:41.924 --> 00:15:43.953
Sometimes I think

00:15:43.977 --> 00:15:46.411
we are the ones in charge.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.785
Chris Milk: How was it?

00:15:52.809 --> 00:15:56.524
(Applause)

00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:59.477
That was a cheap way of getting you
to do a standing ovation.

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:02.309
I just made you all stand.
I knew you'd applaud at the end.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.974
(Applause)

00:16:03.998 --> 00:16:07.817
I believe that everyone on Earth
needs to experience

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:09.421
what you just experienced.

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:13.203
That way we can collectively
start to shape this,

00:16:13.227 --> 00:16:15.001
not as a tech platform

00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:16.600
but as a humanity platform.

00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:20.682
And to that end, in November of last year,

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:23.992
the New York Times and Vrse made
a VR project called "The Displaced."

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:26.362
It launched with one million
Google Cardboards

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:29.859
sent out to every Sunday subscriber
with their newspaper.

00:16:29.883 --> 00:16:32.401
But a funny thing happened
that Sunday morning.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.747
A lot of people got them

00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:37.977
that were not the intended recipients
on the mailing label.

00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:41.545
And we started seeing this
all over Instagram.

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:46.239
Look familiar?

00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:50.395
Music led me on a path

00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:53.468
of searching for what seemed
like the unattainable

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:54.745
for a very long time.

00:16:55.466 --> 00:16:59.437
Now, millions of kids just had
the same formative experience

00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:01.202
in their childhood

00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:03.530
that I had in mine.

00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:06.545
Only I think this one

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:07.727
surpasses it.

00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:09.508
Let's see

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.009
where this

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.723
leads them.

00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:14.535
Thank you.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:21.041
(Applause)
