00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:16.118
The universe is teeming with planets.

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:17.994
I want us, in the next decade,

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.387
to build a space telescope that'll be able to image

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.488
an Earth about another star

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.232
and figure out whether it can harbor life.

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:27.392
My colleagues at the NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:30.253
at Princeton and I are working on technology

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:33.791
that will be able to do just that in the coming years.

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.776
Astronomers now believe that every star

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:37.716
in the galaxy has a planet,

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:39.992
and they speculate that up to one fifth of them

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:41.068
have an Earth-like planet

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:42.760
that might be able to harbor life,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.522
but we haven't seen any of them.

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.260
We've only detected them indirectly.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.493
This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:53.290
It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.048
when they turned it around as
it was exiting the solar system

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:57.760
to take a picture of the Earth

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.082
from six billion kilometers away.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.650
I want to take that

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.232
of an Earth-like planet about another star.

00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:06.632
Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.054
Well to see, let's imagine we take

00:01:08.054 --> 00:01:10.000
the Hubble Space Telescope

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.698
and we turn it around and we move it out

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:13.232
to the orbit of Mars.

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:14.440
We'll see something like that,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.508
a slightly blurry picture of the Earth,

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:18.829
because we're a fairly small telescope

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.368
out at the orbit of Mars.

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.384
Now let's move ten times further away.

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:24.320
Here we are at the orbit of Uranus.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.806
It's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.591
We can still see the little moon,

00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.704
but let's go ten times further away again.

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:32.435
Here we are at the edge of the solar system,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:33.733
out at the Kuiper Belt.

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.439
Now it's not resolved at all.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.103
It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.

00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:40.303
But let's move yet again ten times further away.

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:41.927
Here we are out at the Oort Cloud,

00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:43.487
outside the solar system,

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:45.103
and we're starting to see the sun

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:46.415
move into the field of view

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:47.879
and get into where the planet is.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.010
One more time, ten times further away.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.663
Now we're at Alpha Centauri,

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:52.903
our nearest neighbor star,

00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.252
and the planet is gone.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.860
All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.817
that's ten billion times brighter than the planet,

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:01.623
which should be in that little red circle.

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:03.823
That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.143
The light from the star is diffracting.

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.884
It's scattering inside the telescope,

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:09.388
creating that very bright image

00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:11.140
that washes out the planet.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.411
So to see the planet,

00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.671
we have to do something about all of that light.

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.902
We have to get rid of it.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.347
I have a lot of colleagues working on

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.362
really amazing technologies to do that,

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:21.177
but I want to tell you about one today

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:22.674
that I think is the coolest,

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:24.874
and probably the most likely to get us an Earth

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.410
in the next decade.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.482
It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:31.642
the father of the space telescope, in 1962,

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:33.758
and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:35.941
You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:37.981
The moon has moved in front of the sun.

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.741
It blocks out most of the light

00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.117
so we can see that dim corona around it.

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:43.780
It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.365
and blocked that spotlight
that's getting right in my eye,

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.277
I can see you in the back row.

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:49.579
Well, what's going on?

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.524
Well the moon

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.939
is casting a shadow down on the Earth.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.174
We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,

00:02:57.174 --> 00:02:58.685
we look back at the sun,

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:00.325
and most of the light's been removed

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.415
and we can see that dim, fine structure

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.690
in the corona.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.357
Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.

00:03:06.357 --> 00:03:09.134
We build a big screen, we fly it in space,

00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:11.181
we put it up in front of the star,

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.965
we block out most of the light,

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:15.981
we fly a space telescope in
that shadow that's created,

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:17.758
and boom, we get to see planets.

00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:20.421
Well that would look something like this.

00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:22.010
So there's that big screen,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.885
and there's no planets,

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:25.389
because unfortunately it doesn't
actually work very well,

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.309
because the light waves of the light and waves

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.989
diffracts around that screen

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.773
the same way it did in the telescope.

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:34.910
It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.700
and all that light just destroys the shadow.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.373
It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:41.140
But Spitzer actually knew the answer.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.645
If we can feather the edges, soften those edges

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.411
so we can control diffraction,

00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:47.126
well then we can see a planet,

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.925
and in the last 10 years or so we've come up

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:50.969
with optimal solutions for doing that.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.501
It looks something like that.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.846
We call that our flower petal starshade.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.806
If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.230
if we control their shape,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.788
we can control diffraction,

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:04.234
and now we have a great shadow.

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:06.878
It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:10.324
and we can see the planets beam out just like that.

00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:12.182
That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.

00:04:12.182 --> 00:04:13.640
That starshade is about

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.216
the size of half a football field

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:18.806
and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers
away from the telescope

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:20.866
that has to be held right in its shadow,

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.830
and then we can see those planets.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.238
This sounds formidable,

00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:27.246
but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:30.126
came up with a fabulous design for how to do that

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:31.200
and it looks like this.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.988
It starts wrapped around a hub.

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.967
It separates from the telescope.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.238
The petals unfurl, they open up,

00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:38.998
the telescope turns around.

00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:41.142
Then you'll see it flip and fly out

00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:44.357
that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.

00:04:44.357 --> 00:04:46.827
It's going to move in front of the star

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:50.110
just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.914
Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.

00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:55.638
(Applause)

00:04:55.638 --> 00:04:57.997
Thank you.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.950
That's not science fiction.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.513
We've been working on this
for the last five or six years.

00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:05.116
Last summer, we did a really cool test

00:05:05.116 --> 00:05:07.555
out in California at Northrop Grumman.

00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:09.138
So those are four petals.

00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:10.850
This is a sub-scale star shade.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.347
It's about half the size of the one you just saw.

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:14.807
You'll see the petals unfurl.

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.874
Those four petals were built by four undergraduates

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:19.289
doing a summer internship at JPL.

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.535
Now you're seeing it deploy.

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:22.517
Those petals have to rotate into place.

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:23.687
The base of those petals

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:26.060
has to go to the same place every time

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.683
to within a tenth of a millimeter.

00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:29.443
We ran this test 16 times,

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:32.282
and 16 times it went into the exact same place

00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:33.723
to a tenth of a millimeter.

00:05:33.723 --> 00:05:35.655
This has to be done very precisely,

00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:38.163
but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,

00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:39.647
if we can get it into space,

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:41.448
you might see something like this.

00:05:41.448 --> 00:05:43.720
That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.314
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:48.698
If we can take a similar space telescope,

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:49.956
slightly larger,

00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:51.378
put it out there,

00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:52.764
fly an occulter in front of it,

00:05:52.764 --> 00:05:54.954
what we might see is something like that --

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.890
that's a family portrait of our
solar system -- but not ours.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.412
We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:02.044
as seen through an occulter,

00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:03.114
through a starshade like that.

00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:05.139
You can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.762
Uranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,

00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:09.102
next to the residual light

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.007
is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:13.381
We want to see that, see if there's water,

00:06:13.381 --> 00:06:14.786
oxygen, ozone,

00:06:14.786 --> 00:06:17.309
the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.718
I think this is the coolest possible science.

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:21.371
That's why I got into doing this,

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:23.341
because I think that will change the world.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.779
That will change everything when we see that.

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.365
Thank you.

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:31.365
(Applause)
