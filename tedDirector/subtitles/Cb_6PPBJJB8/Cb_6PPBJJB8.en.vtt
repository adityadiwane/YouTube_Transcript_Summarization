00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
For some time I have been interested in

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the placebo effect,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
which might seem like an odd thing

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
for a magician to be interested in,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
unless you think of it in the terms that I do,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
which is, "Something fake

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
is believed in enough by somebody

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
that it becomes something real."

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
In other words, sugar pills

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
the placebo effect,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
just because the person thinks

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
or some sort of a --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
for pain management, for example,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
called the placebo effect.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Something fake becomes

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
something real

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
because of someone's perception of it.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
In order for us to understand each other,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
very simple magic trick.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And then I'll explain why I explained it.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So, here's what happens.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I'll get my sleeve back.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
That way you can see that at no time

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
nothing can go up or down my sleeve.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And the object of this is quite simple.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I'm going to open my hand,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and hopefully, if all is well,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
In fact it's held so tightly in place

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that I can shake it,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and the knife does not come off.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
no trickery. And you can examine everything.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Ta-da!

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
(Applause)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that are interested in magic, because you can learn

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
a great deal about deception by studying

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Probably many of you in the room know this trick.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
What happens is this.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
I hold the knife in my hand.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that is a lie.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The reason I'm holding onto my wrist

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
is because that's actually the secret

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
of the illusion.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
to being away from you,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
from where it is, to a position

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
pointing out like this.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Nice one.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Laughter)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So, it goes like this, from here, right.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And as I move around my finger shifts.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And we could talk about why this is deceptive,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
because the mind, and the way it processes information,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
but by chicanery,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
my index finger being there.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And then when I close my finger, same thing,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
as I move back, this motion

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
kind of covers the moving back of my finger.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
I take this hand away. You give the knife out.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.260
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Now, (Laughter)

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
what does that have to do with the placebo effect?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I read a study a year or so ago

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
that really blew my mind wide open.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
was an astonishing thing.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
It turns out that if you administer

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
a placebo in the form of a white pill,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that's like aspirin shaped --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
like you make a smaller pill,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
it is actually measurably more effective.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Even though neither one of these things

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
If you have capsules,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
they're more effective than tablets in any form.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
is better than a white capsule.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Dosage has something to do with this.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
One pill twice a day

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
is not as good at three pills --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
But the point is ...

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And the form has something to do with it.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And if you want the ultimate in placebo,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
you've go to the needle.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Right? A syringe with some inert --

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
a couple CCs of some inert something,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and you inject this into a patient ...

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
it's so much stronger than the white pill.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
some other time when we have slides.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
The point is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
it's only your belief that makes it real

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
in your body and makes a stronger effect.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I wanted to see if I could take that idea

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and apply it to a magic trick.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And take something that is obviously a fake trick

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and make it seem real.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And we know from that study

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that when you want reality, you go to the needle.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
This is really my flesh. This is not

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Damian's special-grown flesh.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
I'm going to pierce my skin

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and run this needle through to the other side.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
If you're queasy -- (Laughs)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and one woman almost passed out.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
So, I suggest if you get queasy easy

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that you look away for about the next 30 --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So, here is what happens, right here,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
the beginning of my flesh

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
at the lower part of my arm I just make

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
a little pierce.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
and then out the other side like this.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
with the knife trick.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
(Laughter)

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Sort of.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
But you can't count my fingers right now can you?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
three, four, five.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Yes, well...

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I know what people think when they see this.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
So, let me give you a little peek.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
How's that look out there? Pretty good.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
(Laughs)

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Yeah, I know. (Laughs)

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Let me give you good close look at this.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
don't look at the thing.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Well let me work up some blood for you.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
(Laughter)

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Yes, there it is.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.260
(Applause)

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
(Laughter)

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Normally now, I would take the needle out.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
But I think in this context

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and with the idea of taking something fake

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and making it into something real,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
I'm just going to leave it there,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and walk off the stage.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
(Laughter)

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
(Laughter)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
(Applause)
