00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.342
I'm not sure that every person here

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:18.079
is familiar with my pictures.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.162
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you,

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:25.112
and after I'll speak.

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:01.836
I must speak to you a little bit of my history,

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:03.783
because we'll be speaking on this

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:06.764
during my speech here.

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:09.900
I was born in 1944 in Brazil,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.655
in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.538
I was born on a farm,

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:20.040
a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.660
A marvelous place.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.972
I lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:30.213
I swam in our small rivers with our caimans.

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:33.122
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm,

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:37.404
and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:39.511
Very few things went to the market.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.221
Once a year, the only thing that went to the market

00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:43.941
was the cattle that we produced,

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:46.710
and we made trips of about 45 days

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.886
to reach the slaughterhouse,

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:51.180
bringing thousands of head of cattle,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.712
and about 20 days traveling back

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.109
to reach our farm again.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.486
When I was 15 years old,

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:01.991
it was necessary for me to leave this place

00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:05.454
and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger --

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.885
where I did the second part of secondary school.

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.653
There I learned different things.

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.278
Brazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:18.693
and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:21.535
I was a member of leftist parties,

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.641
and I became an activist.

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.733
I [went to] university to become an economist.

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:30.413
I [did] a master's degree in economics.

00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:33.422
And the most important thing in my life

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:35.081
also happened in this time.

00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:37.770
I met an incredible girl

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.908
who became my lifelong best friend,

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:45.676
and my associate in everything that I have done till now,

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:48.940
my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.844
Brazil radicalized very strongly.

00:02:50.844 --> 00:02:53.756
We fought very hard against the dictatorship,

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.542
in a moment it was necessary to us:

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.126
Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.581
or leave Brazil. We were too young,

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:06.782
and our organization thought it was better for us to go out,

00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:07.746
and we went to France,

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:09.765
where I did a PhD in economics,

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:11.761
Léila became an architect.

00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:14.844
I worked after for an investment bank.

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:17.806
We made a lot of trips, financed development,

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:20.661
economic projects in Africa with the World Bank.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:24.129
And one day photography made a total invasion in my life.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.367
I became a photographer,

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.983
abandoned everything and became a photographer,

00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:30.808
and I started to do the photography

00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:33.804
that was important for me.

00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:35.990
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.566
that you are an anthropologist photographer,

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:41.327
that you are an activist photographer.

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:44.327
But I did much more than that.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:47.009
I put photography as my life.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.613
I lived totally inside photography

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:51.648
doing long term projects,

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.158
and I want to show you just a few pictures

00:03:54.158 --> 00:04:00.055
of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects,

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:02.217
that I went to, I published many books

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:05.423
on these photographs,

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:09.178
but I'll just show you a few ones now.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.724
In the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,

00:04:58.724 --> 00:05:01.965
I photographed a story called Migrations.

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:03.842
It became a book. It became a show.

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:06.600
But during the time that I was photographing this,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.337
I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.

00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:16.648
I saw in Rwanda total brutality.

00:05:16.648 --> 00:05:19.813
I saw deaths by thousands per day.

00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:22.754
I lost my faith in our species.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:26.945
I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:32.492
and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.

00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:35.476
I started to have infection everywhere.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:39.888
When I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;

00:05:39.888 --> 00:05:42.715
I had blood.

00:05:42.715 --> 00:05:45.596
I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:48.362
told him that I was completely sick.

00:05:48.362 --> 00:05:51.216
He made a long examination, and told me, "Sebastian,

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:54.353
you are not sick, your prostate is perfect.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:58.441
What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.360
You must stop. Stop.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.201
You must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead."

00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.847
And I made the decision to stop.

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:12.140
I was really upset with photography,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.161
with everything in the world,

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:18.001
and I made the decision to go back to where I was born.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:19.605
It was a big coincidence.

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:23.016
It was the moment that my parents became very old.

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:26.577
I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,

00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:28.445
and they made together the decision

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:31.145
to transfer this land to Léila and myself.

00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:36.761
When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.

00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:40.065
When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.587
When we received the land,

00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:45.362
it was less than half a percent rainforest,

00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.007
as in all my region.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.936
To build development, Brazilian development,

00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:52.723
we destroyed a lot of our forest.

00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:54.706
As you did here in the United States,

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.994
or you did in India, everywhere in this planet.

00:06:56.994 --> 00:06:58.672
To build our development,

00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:00.755
we come to a huge contradiction

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:04.490
that we destroy around us everything.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.155
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle

00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:10.322
had just a few hundreds,

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.727
and we didn't know how to deal with these.

00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:16.627
And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea.

00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:21.274
She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.780
You say that you were born in paradise.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.706
Let's build the paradise again.

00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:28.538
And I went to see a good friend

00:07:28.538 --> 00:07:30.071
that was engineering forests

00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:31.969
to prepare a project for us,

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.150
and we started. We started to plant, and this

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.407
first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,

00:07:38.407 --> 00:07:43.468
and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:46.831
We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:50.271
only local species, only native species,

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.812
where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,

00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:58.120
and the life started to come back in an incredible way.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.919
It was necessary for us to transform our land

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.361
into a national park.

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:05.019
We transformed. We gave this land back to nature.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:06.394
It became a national park.

00:08:06.394 --> 00:08:10.144
We created an institution called Instituto Terra,

00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:15.123
and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:18.908
Here in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,

00:08:18.908 --> 00:08:21.059
it became tax deductible in the United States.

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:24.387
We raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:26.595
We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.843
that put money into this project, the government.

00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:33.027
And the life started to come, and I had a big wish

00:08:33.027 --> 00:08:36.443
to come back to photography, to photograph again.

00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:39.738
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore

00:08:39.738 --> 00:08:44.321
just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.

00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:46.689
I wished to photograph the other animals,

00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:48.681
to photograph the landscapes,

00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:52.127
to photograph us, but us from the beginning,

00:08:52.127 --> 00:08:54.657
the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:59.210
And I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.410
and I finished at the end of 2011.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.103
We created an incredible amount of pictures,

00:09:05.103 --> 00:09:08.673
and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books,

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.737
the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:14.044
And what we want with these pictures

00:09:14.044 --> 00:09:20.456
is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:22.979
and what we must hold on this planet

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.277
if we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.

00:09:26.277 --> 00:09:28.788
And I wanted to see us

00:09:28.788 --> 00:09:34.655
when we used, yes, our instruments in stone.

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:36.812
We exist yet. I was last week

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.708
at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:43.014
and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups

00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:45.945
of Indians that are not contacted yet.

00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:48.478
We must protect the forest in this sense.

00:09:48.478 --> 00:09:53.313
And with these pictures, I hope that we can create

00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:55.542
information, a system of information.

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:59.288
We tried to do a new presentation of the planet,

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:01.214
and I want to show you now just a few pictures

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:04.483
of this project, please.

00:11:59.543 --> 00:12:01.975
Well, this — (Applause) —

00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:06.538
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:12:09.142 --> 00:12:12.228
This is what we must fight hard

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:14.119
to hold like it is now.

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:18.230
But there is another part that we must together rebuild,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.247
to build our societies, our modern family of societies,

00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:24.886
we are at a point where we cannot go back.

00:12:24.886 --> 00:12:27.094
But we create an incredible contradiction.

00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.390
To build all this, we destroy a lot.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.600
Our forest in Brazil, that antique forest

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.486
that was the size of California,

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:37.160
is destroyed today 93 percent.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.154
Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.

00:12:40.154 --> 00:12:43.391
Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone.

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:45.258
Gone very fast, disappeared.

00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:47.927
Coming the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,

00:12:47.927 --> 00:12:49.771
I was flying over deserts

00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:52.631
that we made, we provoked with our own hands.

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.290
India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.799
And we must rebuild these forests.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.447
That is the essence of our life, these forests.

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:06.689
We need to breathe. The only factory

00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:10.265
capable to transform CO2 into oxygen,

00:13:10.265 --> 00:13:12.009
are the forests.

00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:16.363
The only machine capable to capture the carbon

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:19.214
that we are producing, always,

00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:23.379
even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:24.878
are the trees.

00:13:24.878 --> 00:13:29.244
I put the question -- three or four weeks ago,

00:13:29.244 --> 00:13:30.933
we saw in the newspapers

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:33.825
millions of fish that die in Norway.

00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:36.841
A lack of oxygen in the water.

00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:39.073
I put to myself the question, if for a moment,

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:43.060
we will not lack oxygen for all animal species,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.498
ours included -- that would be very complicated for us.

00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:50.802
For the water system, the trees are essential.

00:13:50.802 --> 00:13:54.474
I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.

00:13:54.474 --> 00:13:58.400
You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.565
if you take a shower, it takes you

00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:05.089
two or three hours to dry your hair

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:07.410
if you don't use a dryer machine.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.191
Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.

00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.893
The trees are the hair of our planet.

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:18.682
When you have rain in a place that has no trees,

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:22.110
in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.693
brings soil, destroying our water source,

00:14:24.693 --> 00:14:26.600
destroying the rivers,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.010
and no humidity to retain.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.301
When you have trees, the root system holds the water.

00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:35.029
All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.091
create a humid area,

00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:41.811
and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,

00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:45.011
and maintain our source, maintain our rivers.

00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:47.015
This is the most important thing,

00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:51.478
when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life.

00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:53.666
I want to show you now, to finish,

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:56.366
just a few pictures that for me

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:59.305
are very important in that direction.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.455
You remember that I told you,

00:15:01.455 --> 00:15:03.558
when I received the farm from my parents

00:15:03.558 --> 00:15:06.358
that was my paradise, that was the farm.

00:15:06.358 --> 00:15:11.868
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.

00:15:11.868 --> 00:15:14.424
But you can see in this picture,

00:15:14.424 --> 00:15:18.439
we were starting to construct an educational center

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:23.403
that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.

00:15:23.403 --> 00:15:27.741
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.

00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:31.318
In each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.

00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:32.893
There are thousands of trees.

00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:36.101
Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.178
two months ago.

00:15:39.807 --> 00:15:47.154
(Applause)

00:15:48.857 --> 00:15:50.615
I told you in the beginning that it was necessary

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:55.415
for us to plant about 2.5 million trees

00:15:55.415 --> 00:15:57.854
of about 200 different species

00:15:57.854 --> 00:16:01.094
in order to rebuild the ecosystem.

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.629
And I'll show you the last picture.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:06.798
We are with two million trees in the ground now.

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:08.447
We are doing the sequestration

00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:12.901
of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.

00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:17.445
My friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?

00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:19.757
By an accident that happened to me,

00:16:19.757 --> 00:16:23.157
we went back, we built an ecosystem.

00:16:23.157 --> 00:16:25.824
We here inside the room,

00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:29.360
I believe that we have the same concern,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.796
and the model that we created in Brazil,

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:33.141
we can transplant it here.

00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.164
We can apply it everywhere around the world, no?

00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:39.112
And I believe that we can do it together.

00:16:39.112 --> 00:16:40.741
Thank you very much.

00:16:40.741 --> 00:16:45.388
(Applause)
