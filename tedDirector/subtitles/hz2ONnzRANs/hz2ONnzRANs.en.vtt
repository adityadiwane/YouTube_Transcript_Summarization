00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.836
I'm Chetan Bhatt

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.060
and when I give my name,
I'm often asked, "Where are you from?"

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.740
And I normally say London.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.636
(Laughter)

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.156
But of course, I know
what they're really asking,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.196
so I say something like,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.796
"Well, my grandparents and my mum
were born in India,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.476
my dad and I were born in Kenya,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.396
and I was brought up in London.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.916
And then they've got me mapped.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.756
"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.
I've worked with one of those."

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.996
(Laughter)

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.396
And from my name they probably
assume that I'm a Hindu.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.380
And this sort of fixes me for them.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.276
But what about the Christians

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.596
and the Muslims and the atheists

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.116
that I grew up with?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.636
Or the socialists and the liberals,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.236
even the occasional Tory?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.276
(Laughter)

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.116
Indeed, all kinds of women and men --

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.076
vegetable sellers, factory workers,
cooks, car mechanics --

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.596
living in my working class area,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.156
in some profoundly important way,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.876
they are also a part of me

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.460
and are here with me.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.996
Maybe that's why I find it hard
to respond to questions about identity

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.436
and about origin.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.340
And it's not just a sort of
teenage refusal to be labeled.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.516
It's about our own most identities,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.836
the ones that we put our hands up to,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.476
the ones that we cheer for,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.196
the ones that we fight for,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.036
the ones that we love or hate.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.156
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.836
as well as others.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.516
And it's about identities
we just assume that we have

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.780
without thinking too much about them.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.956
But our responses
to questions of identity and origin

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.740
have substantial
social and political importance.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.316
We see the wars, the rages of identity
going on all around us.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.796
We see violent religious,
national and ethnic disputes.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.460
And often the conflict is based
on old stories of identity

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.956
and belonging

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.476
and origins.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.196
And these identities are based on myths,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.916
typically about ancient,
primordial origins.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.356
And these could be about Adam and Eve

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.316
or about the supremacy
of a caste or gender

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.236
or about the vitality of a supposed race

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.676
or about the past glories
of an empire or civilization

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.396
or about a piece of land

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.900
that some imagined deity has gifted.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.036
Now, people say

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.300
that origin stories and identity myths
make us feel secure.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.476
What's wrong with that?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.156
They give us a sense of belonging.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.886
Identity is your cultural clothing,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.120
and it can make you feel
warm and fuzzy inside.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.156
But does it really?

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.156
Do we really need
identity myths to feel safe?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.196
Because I see religious,
national, ethnic disputes

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.500
as adding to human misery.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.956
Can I dare you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.916
to refuse every origin myth

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.140
that claims you?

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.876
What if we reject
every single primordial origin myth

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.316
and develop a deeper sense of personhood,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.756
one responsible to humanity as a whole

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.236
rather than to a particular tribe,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.596
a radically different idea of humanity

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.596
that exposes how origin myths mystify,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.956
disguise global power,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.836
rapacious exploitation,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.796
poverty, the worldwide oppression
of women and girls,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.900
and of course massive,
accelerating inequalities?

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.836
Now, origin myths
are closely linked to tradition,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.316
and the word tradition
points to something old

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.276
and permanent, almost natural,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.036
and people assume tradition
is just history,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.340
simply the past
condensed into a nice story.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.756
But let's not confuse
tradition with history.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.420
The two are often in severe conflict.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.796
Origin stories are usually recently
created fictions of ancient belonging,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.076
and they're absurd

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.756
given the complexity of humanity

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.236
and our vastly interconnected,
even if very unequal world.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.836
And today we see claims to tradition

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.356
that claim to be ancient

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.260
changing rapidly in front of our eyes.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.875
I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:35.916
with Asian, English, Caribbean,
Irish families living in our street,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.036
and the neo-Nazi National Front
was massive then

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.556
with regular marches and attacks on us

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.796
and a permanent threat

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.556
and often a frequent reality
of violence against us

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.780
on the streets, in our homes,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.156
typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.516
And I remember during a general election
a leaflet came through our letter box

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.060
with a picture of the National Front
candidate for our area.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.676
And the picture

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.220
was of our next-door neighbor.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.916
He threatened to shoot me once
when I played in the garden as a kid,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.636
and many weekends, shaven-headed
National Front activists

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.076
arrived at his house

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.316
and emerged with scores of placards

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.740
screaming that they wanted us
to go back home.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.460
But today he's one of my mum's best mates.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.516
He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.236
and at some point in his
political journey out of fascism

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.660
he embraced a broader idea of humanity.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.396
There was a Hindu family
that we got to know well --

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.796
and you have to understand
that life in our street

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.556
was a little bit like the setting
for an Asian soap opera.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.476
Everyone knew everyone else's business,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.196
even if they didn't want it
to be known by anyone at all.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.156
You really had no choice in this matter.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.796
But in this family,
there was a quiet little boy

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.636
who went to the same school as I did,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.476
and after I left school,
I didn't hear much more about him,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.420
except that he'd gone off to India.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.396
Now around 2000,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.660
I remember seeing this short book.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.276
The book was unusual

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.036
because it was written
by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.116
and in it the author calls
for attacks in Britain.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.076
This is in 1999,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.236
so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq
was still in the future,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.076
and he helped scout
New York bombing targets.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.916
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb
to use on the London Underground,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.380
and he plotted a massive bombing campaign
in London's shopping areas.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.076
He's a very high-risk security
prisoner in the UK

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.460
and one of the most important Al Qaeda
figures to be arrested in Britain.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.156
The author of that book

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.636
was the very same quiet little boy

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.860
who went to my school.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.116
So a Hindu boy from Britain

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.876
became an Al Qaeda fighter

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.956
and a most-wanted international terrorist,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.076
and he rejected what people would call
his Hindu or Indian or British identity,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.956
and he became someone else.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.836
He refused to be who he was.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.156
He recreated himself,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.476
and this kind of journey is very common

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.956
for young men and women

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.076
who become involved
in Al Qaeda or Islamic State

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.396
or other transnational armed groups.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.276
Al Qaeda's media spokesman
is a white American

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.756
from a Jewish and Catholic
mixed background,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.556
and neither he nor the boy from my school

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.276
were from Muslim backgrounds.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.036
There's no point in asking them
where are they from.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.500
A more important question is
where they're going.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.076
And I would also put it to you

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.236
that exactly the same journey
occurs for those young men and women

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.196
who were brought up
in Muslim family backgrounds.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.036
Most of those who join Al Qaeda

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.036
and other Salafi jihadi groups
from Europe, Asia, North America,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.956
even in many cases the Middle East

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.916
are those who have comprehensively
rejected their backgrounds

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.020
to become, in essence, new people.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.956
They spend an enormous amount of time
attacking their parents' backgrounds

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.996
as profane, impure, blasphemous,

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.316
the wrong type of Islam,

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.836
and their vision instead

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.436
is a fantastical view
of cosmic apocalypse.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.796
It's a born again vision.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.236
Discard your past,
your society, your family and friends

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.420
since they're all impure.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.140
Instead, become someone else,

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.340
your true self,

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.580
your authentic self.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.876
Now, this isn't
about a return to the past.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.116
It's about using a forgery of the past

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.636
to envision an appalling future
which begins today at year zero.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.156
This is why over 80 percent of the victims
of Al Qaeda and Islamic State

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.876
are people from Muslim backgrounds.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.236
The first act by Salafi jihadi groups
when they take over an area

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.356
is to destroy existing Muslim institutions

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.340
including mosques,
shrines, preachers, practices.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.716
Their main purpose is to control
and punish people internally,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.436
to dictate the spaces that women may go,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.596
their clothing, family relations,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.916
beliefs, even the minute detail
of how one prays.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.036
And you get the impression in the news

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.316
that they are after us in the West,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.900
but they are actually mainly after
people from other Muslim backgrounds.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.156
In their view, no other Muslim
can ever be pure enough,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.276
so ordinary beliefs and practices
that have existed for centuries

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.276
are attacked as impure

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.476
by teenagers from Birmingham or London

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.220
who know nothing

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.700
about the histories
that they so joyously obliterate.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.476
Now here, their claim to tradition
is at war with history,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.556
but they're nevertheless
very certain about their purity

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.900
and about the impurity of others.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.540
Purity,

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.076
certainty,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.836
the return to authentic tradition,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.156
the quest for these
can lead to lethal visions

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.196
of perfect societies and perfected people.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.476
This is what the main Hindu
fundamentalist organization in India

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.780
looks like today at its mass rally.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.876
Maybe it reminds you
of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.116
and the movement's roots
are indeed in fascism.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.876
It was a member of the same
Hindu fundamentalist movement

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.740
who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.996
Hindu fundamentalists today
view this murderer as a national hero,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.836
and they want to put up
statues of him throughout India.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.476
They've been involved for decades

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.036
in large-scale mass violence
against minorities.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.676
They ban books, art, films.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.956
They attack romantic couples
on Valentine's Day,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.036
Christians on Christmas Day.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.956
They don't like others talking critically

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.596
about what they see
as their ancient culture

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.116
or using its images

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.756
or caricaturing it

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.340
or drawing cartoons about it.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.996
But the people making
the strongest possible claims

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.916
about ancient, timeless Hindu religion

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.556
are dressed in brown shorts
and white shirts

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.236
while claiming, oddly,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.116
to be the original Aryan race,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.556
just like the violent Salafi jihadis

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.556
who make their claims
about their primordial religion

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.036
while dressed in black military uniforms

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.580
and wearing balaclavas.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.156
These people are manufacturing
pure, pristine identities of conviction

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.396
and of certainty.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.980
Fundamentalists see religion and culture
as their sole property, a property.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.396
But religions and cultures are processes.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.796
They're not things. They're impermanent.
They're messy. They're impure.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.556
Look at any religion
and you'll see disputes and arguments

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.580
going all the way down.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.380
Any criticism of religion in any form

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.116
has to therefore be

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.716
part of the expansive sense of humanity

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.940
we should aspire to.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.676
I respect your right
to have and to express your religion

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.316
or your culture or your opinion,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.196
but I don't necessarily
have to respect the content.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.476
I might like some of it.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.316
I might like how an old church
looks, for example,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.860
but this isn't the same thing.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.396
Similarly, I have a human right

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.556
to say something
that you may find offensive,

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.060
but you do not have a human right
not to be offended.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.836
In a genuine democracy,
we're constantly offended

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.636
since people express
different views all the time.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.500
They also change their views,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.716
so their views are impermanent.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.036
You cannot fix someone's political views

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.180
based on their religious
or national or cultural background.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.476
Now, these points about religious purity

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.900
also apply to nationalism and to racism.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.340
I'm always puzzled

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.300
to have pride in your national
or ethnic identity,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.140
pride in the accident of birth
from a warm and cozy womb,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.780
belief in your superiority
because of the accident of birth.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.356
These people have very firm ideas

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.380
about what belongs and what doesn't belong

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:29.076
inside the cozy national cultures
that they imagine.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.916
And I'm going to caricature a bit here,
but only a little bit.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.196
I want you to imagine
the supporter of some Little Englander

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.116
or British nationalist political party,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.516
and he's sitting at home

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.396
and he's screaming about foreigners

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.236
invading his country

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.196
while watching Fox News,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.396
an American cable channel

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.876
owned by an Australian

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.036
on his South Korean television set

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.636
which was bought
by his Spanish credit card

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.916
which is paid off monthly
by his high-street British bank

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.580
which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.236
He supports a British football team
owned by a Russian.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.996
His favorite brand of fish and chips

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.676
is owned by a Swedish
venture capitalist firm.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.196
The church he sometimes goes to

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.660
has its creed decided
in meetings in Ghana.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.180
His Union Jack underpants

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.356
were made in India.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.636
(Laughter)

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.876
And --

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.836
(Applause)

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.076
Thank you.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.036
And they're laundered regularly

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.836
by a very nice Polish lady.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.060
(Laughter)

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.836
There is no pure ethnicity,
national culture,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.956
and the ethical choices we have today

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.956
are far wider than being forced to choose

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.436
between racist right
and religious right visions,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.540
dismal visions of culture.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.516
Now, culture isn't just
about language, food, clothing and music,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.836
but gender relations, ancient monuments,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.380
a heritage of sacred texts.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.716
But culture can also be
what has been decided to be culture

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.516
by those who have a political stake

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.180
in pounding culture
into the shape of a prison.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.076
Big political identity claims
are elite bids for power.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.196
They're not answers to social
or economic or political injustices.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.820
They often obscure them.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.116
And what about the large number
of people across the globe

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.316
who can't point
to a monument from their past,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.676
who don't possess a sacred written text,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.756
who can't hark back

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.476
to the past glories
of a civilization or empire?

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.460
Are these people less a part of humanity?

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.956
What about you,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.236
now, listening to this?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.916
What about you and your identity,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.316
because you stitch your experiences
and your thoughts into a continuous person

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.436
moving forward in time.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.316
And this is what you are when you say,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.340
"I," "am," or "me."

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.556
But this also includes
all of your hopes and dreams,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.076
all of the you's that could have been,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.436
and it includes all the other people

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.716
and the things that are
in the biography of who you are.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.756
They, the others,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.556
are also a part of you,

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.540
moving forward with you.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.316
Your authentic self,
if such a thing exists,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.476
is a complex, messy and uncertain self,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.660
and that is a very good thing.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.276
Why not value those
impurities and uncertainties?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.116
Maybe clinging to pure identities
is a sign of immaturity,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.236
and ethnic, nationalist
and religious traditions are bad for you.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.116
Why not be skeptical
about every primordial origin claim

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.596
made on your behalf?

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.300
Why not reject the identity myths
that call on you to belong,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.356
that politicians and community leaders,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.196
so-called community leaders,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.476
place on you?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.156
If we don't need origin stories
and fixed identities,

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.476
we can challenge ourselves
to think creatively

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.076
about each other and our future.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.036
And here culture
always takes care of itself.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.516
I'm not worried about culture.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.956
Cultures are creative, dynamic processes,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.020
not imposed laws and boundaries.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.436
This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad
ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.396
a very senior Muslim judge and thinker
in Cordoba in the 12th century,

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:31.556
and his writings were considered
deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.956
Long after he died,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.356
followers of his work
were ruthlessly hunted down,

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.116
banished and killed over several centuries

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:42.580
by the most powerful religious institution
of the medieval period.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.220
That institution was
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.076
Why?

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.836
Because ibn Rushd said
that something true in religion

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.196
may conflict with something

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.220
that your reason
finds to be true on earth,

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.700
but the latter is still true.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.356
There are two distinct worlds of truth,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.276
one based on our reason and evidence,
and one that is divine,

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.196
and the state, political power, social law
are in the realm of reason.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.156
Religious life is a different realm.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.916
They should be kept separated.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.516
Social and political life
should be governed by our reason,

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.996
not by religion.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.716
And you can see why the church
was upset by his writings,

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.236
as indeed were some Muslims
during his lifetime,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.780
because he gives us
a strong statement of secularism

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.900
of a kind which is normal in Europe today.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.476
Now, history plays many tricks on us.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.196
It undermines our fixed truths

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.036
and what we believe
to be our culture and their culture.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.516
Ibn Rushd, someone
who happens to be a Muslim,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.476
is considered one of the key influences

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.140
in the introduction and spread
of secularism in Europe.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.036
So against religious, nationalist
and racial purists of all kinds,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.276
can you make his story a part of your own,

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.196
not because he happened to be a Muslim,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.196
not because he happened to be an Arab,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.940
but because he was a human being

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.596
with some very good ideas

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.980
that shook his world

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.940
and ours.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.836
Thank you.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.500
(Applause)
