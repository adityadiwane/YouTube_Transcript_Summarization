00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
In fact, mostly now in other things.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
groupings that go back a long time,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
longer than the familiar families.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and I would love to see where that leads.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Does it really lead to a single ancestor

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
some 20, 25,000 years ago?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.160
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
You may just know more about everything than anyone.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
(Applause)
