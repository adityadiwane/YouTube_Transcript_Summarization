00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
As technology progresses,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and as it advances,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
many of us assume that these advances

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
make us more intelligent,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
make us smarter and more connected to the world.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And what I'd like to argue

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
is that that's not necessarily the case,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
as progress is simply a word for change,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and with change you gain something,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
but you also lose something.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
is to show you how technology has dealt with

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.260
a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And that question is this.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
What time is it? What time is it?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
if you didn't have an iPhone?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
How would you do it?

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that's called an astrolabe.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
But, at the time, in the 13th century,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
it was the gadget of the day.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
It was the world's first popular computer.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
If you were an educated child,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
you would know how to not only use the astrolabe,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
you would also know how to make an astrolabe.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
the first technical manual in the English language,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And the central idea that makes this computer work

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
is this thing called stereographic projection.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And basically, the concept is,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
how do you represent the three-dimensional image

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
of the night sky that surrounds us

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
The idea is actually relatively simple.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Each point on the surface of the sphere

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
is mapped through the bottom pole,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
correspond to an offset circle.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
so they fit perfectly.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And then there is their location on the sky

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260
as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So how would you use this device?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Well, let me first back up for a moment.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.260
This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And you can see the different components.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
This is the mater, the scales on the back.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
That's the movable part of the sky.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And in the back you can see

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
a spider web pattern.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
This is a rule device. And on the back

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
are some other devices, measuring tools

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
You know, I've always wanted one of these.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And this one, this is a replica

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
from a 15th-century device.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
But a real one would cost about as much as my house,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
on both sides of the street,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
They are just incredibly expensive.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
But let me show you how to work this device.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So let's go to step one.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
First thing that you do is you select a star

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So, step two, I hold the device up,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and then I sight its altitude there

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
so I can see it clearly now.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
And then I measure its altitude.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Deneb is there. I can tell.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Step four is I then move the rete,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
move the sky, so the altitude of the star

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
corresponds to the scale on the back.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Okay, so when that happens

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
everything lines up.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
I have here a model of the sky

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that corresponds to the real sky. Okay?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So, it is, in a sense,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
holding a model of the universe in my hands.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And then finally, I take a rule,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and move the rule to a date line

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
which then tells me the time here.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Right. So, that's how the device is used.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.260
(Laughter)

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So, I know what you're thinking:

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
what the time is, with precision.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
The way little Lewis would tell the time

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
is by a picture of the sky.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
He would know where things would fit in the sky.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
He would not only know what time it was,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
he would also know where the sun would rise,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and how it would move across the sky.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
in the heavens.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So, in computer graphics

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and computer user interface design,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
there is a term called affordances.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So, affordances are the qualities of an object

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
that allow us to perform an action with it.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
it affords us, to connect to the night sky,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
to look up into the night sky and be much more --

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to see the visible and the invisible together.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.260
So, that's just one use. Incredible,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
there is probably 350, 400 uses.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
of this first computer.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
On the back there is scales and measurements

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
for terrestrial navigation.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.260
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Astrolabes have an incredible history.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
They are over 2,000 years old.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The concept of stereographic projection

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
originated in 330 B.C.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And the astrolabes come in many different

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
sizes and shapes and forms.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
There is portable ones. There is large display ones.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And I think what is common to all astrolabes

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
is that they are beautiful works of art.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
that is just astonishing and remarkable.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.260
So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And advancing retes became cultural emblems.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
This is one from Oxford.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
is completely symmetrical,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
How cool is that? This is just amazing.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
was a portable device

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that you could keep in the back of your pocket.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So, what does the astrolabe inspire?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Well, I think the first thing is that

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
it reminds us just how resourceful people were,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
our forebears were, years and years ago.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
It's just an incredible device.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Every technology advances.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Every technology is transformed and moved by others.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And what we gain with a new technology, of course,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
is precision and accuracy.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
But what we lose, I think, is

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
an accurate -- a felt sense

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
of the sky, a sense of context.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
is the center of the real answer

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
to knowing what time it is.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And so, what can you learn from these devices?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
that we can connect with the world.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
of how things all fit together,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
and also how we connect to the world.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Thanks very much.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
(Applause)
