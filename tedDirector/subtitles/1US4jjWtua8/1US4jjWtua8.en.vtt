00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.995
Tonight, I want to have a conversation about

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:16.929
this incredible global issue

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.466
that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.787
something we can all relate to,

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:25.517
and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:28.794
But first, I want to take you on a little journey.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.590
Let's first visit our planet, but at night,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.126
and from space.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:36.077
This is what our planet looks like from outer space

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.215
at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.069
around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.386
of course, is how dominant the human presence

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:46.450
on our planet is.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.185
We see cities, we see oil fields,

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:52.382
you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:54.946
that we are dominating much of our planet,

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:56.719
and mostly through the use of energy

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.453
that we see here at night.

00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:00.627
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.669
and look during the daytime.

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:06.359
What we see during the day is our landscapes.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:09.912
This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called RondÃ´nia

00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:13.502
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.

00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:16.118
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.644
you're going to see a thin white line,

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:22.022
which is a road that was built in the 1970s.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:25.689
If we come back to the same place in 2001,

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.946
what we're going to find is that these roads

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:31.796
spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:34.937
at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.098
where there are going to be a few cows.

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:40.410
These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.041
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.825
in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.561
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.146
is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:53.374
especially in this part of the world.

00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:56.697
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:59.089
we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:03.225
here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:06.787
there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:08.099
and there's a lone farmer out there

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.662
in the middle of the primeval jungle.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:15.435
Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.963
and we'll see that that landscape actually looks

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.845
a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:24.213
In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.

00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:27.086
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.832
as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:33.373
about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:36.803
animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:39.415
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.207
So soybeans have really exploded,

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:44.832
showing how trade and globalization are

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:47.704
really responsible for the connections to rainforests

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.641
and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange

00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.357
and interconnected world that we have today.

00:02:52.357 --> 00:02:54.678
Well, again and again, what we find as we look

00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:56.814
around the world in our little tour of the world

00:02:56.814 --> 00:03:00.565
is that landscape after landscape after landscape

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:03.334
have been cleared and altered for growing food

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.669
and other crops.

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.029
So one of the questions we've been asking is,

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.517
how much of the world is used to grow food,

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:12.913
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that

00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:15.407
into the future, and what does it mean?

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:18.375
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:21.295
using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.479
farming on a global scale.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.191
And this is what we found, and it's startling.

00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.982
This map shows the presence of agriculture

00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:32.046
on planet Earth.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:35.006
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.207
like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.

00:03:38.207 --> 00:03:42.471
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.595
If you put it all together in one place,

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:47.262
it'd be the size of South America.

00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:49.938
The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.155
and rangelands, where our animals live.

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:54.871
That area's about 30 million square kilometers,

00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:57.290
or about an Africa's worth of land,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.203
a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,

00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:02.355
is what you see. And what's left is, like,

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.366
the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:06.057
or the middle of a rain forest.

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:09.802
We're using a planet's worth of land already.

00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:12.593
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:15.305
of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:17.874
and it's 60 times larger

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:20.449
than all the areas we complain about,

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.666
our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:26.529
Half of humanity lives in cities today,

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:30.465
but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.384
So this is an amazing kind of result,

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:34.561
and it really shocked us when we looked at that.

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.265
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,

00:04:37.265 --> 00:04:39.971
but also we're using a lot of water.

00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.499
This is a photograph flying into Arizona,

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.308
and when you look at it, you're like,

00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:44.435
"What are they growing here?" It turns out

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:47.367
they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.755
using water sprayed on top.

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.305
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:53.981
in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.293
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come

00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:58.837
from some place, and it comes from here,

00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:01.477
the Colorado River in North America.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.125
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.244
this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:09.029
kind of an average day, it looks something like this.

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.933
But if we come back today, during a normal condition

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:15.501
to the exact same location, this is what's left.

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.503
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:22.059
or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.979
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.386
and using it to grow food,

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:30.066
and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:33.346
it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.

00:05:33.346 --> 00:05:36.474
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America

00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:38.602
for irrigation.

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:40.358
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.

00:05:40.358 --> 00:05:43.178
This probably is: the Aral Sea.

00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:46.082
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.

00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:48.141
This is in the former Soviet Union

00:05:48.141 --> 00:05:50.713
in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,

00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:53.161
one of the great inland seas of the world.

00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:55.473
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like

00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:58.995
it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:00.958
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,

00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.450
you see two little rivers kind of coming down

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.967
through the sand, feeding this basin with water.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.549
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:12.482
far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river

00:06:12.482 --> 00:06:15.682
through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:19.694
Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water

00:06:19.694 --> 00:06:22.047
to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:25.827
in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets

00:06:25.827 --> 00:06:27.887
to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.813
They really needed the money.

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:31.809
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.739
the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:37.187
Here it is in 1973,

00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:39.399
1986,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.203
1999,

00:06:42.203 --> 00:06:45.258
2004,

00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:49.923
and about 11 months ago.

00:06:49.923 --> 00:06:51.972
It's pretty extraordinary.

00:06:51.972 --> 00:06:55.163
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.

00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:57.823
Imagine that was Lake Superior.

00:06:57.823 --> 00:07:01.097
Imagine that was Lake Huron.

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:02.704
It's an extraordinary change.

00:07:02.704 --> 00:07:05.047
This is not only a change in water and

00:07:05.047 --> 00:07:07.416
where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals

00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:09.673
of the environment of this region.

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:10.957
Let's start with this.

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:13.167
The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.707
Let's put it that way.

00:07:14.707 --> 00:07:18.111
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.

00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:20.055
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things

00:07:20.055 --> 00:07:22.471
that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.

00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:24.603
One of those small islands that was remote

00:07:24.603 --> 00:07:26.215
and impossible to get to was a site

00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:28.911
of Soviet biological weapons testing.

00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:30.265
You can walk there today.

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:31.812
Weather patterns have changed.

00:07:31.812 --> 00:07:35.121
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.071
in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.951
This is an environmental disaster writ large.

00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:42.446
But let's bring it home.

00:07:42.446 --> 00:07:45.175
This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago

00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:46.824
that he took when he was in the Soviet Union

00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:48.086
a long, long time ago,

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:51.082
showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.

00:07:51.082 --> 00:07:53.240
You see the canal they dug?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.704
They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.920
the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.384
because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't

00:08:00.384 --> 00:08:02.554
keep up with the retreating shoreline.

00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:04.565
I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future

00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:06.963
archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about

00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:09.783
our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"

00:08:09.783 --> 00:08:12.811
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.

00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:15.724
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:17.916
that's sustainable, and agriculture alone

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:20.316
is 70 percent of that.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:23.476
So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:26.820
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.156
Usually when we think about the atmosphere,

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:31.804
we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,

00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:33.860
and mostly around energy,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.496
but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:38.548
of greenhouse gases too.

00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:40.604
If you look at carbon dioxide from

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:42.756
burning tropical rainforest,

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.316
or methane coming from cows and rice,

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.229
or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,

00:08:48.229 --> 00:08:51.000
it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.016
gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:55.870
That's more than all our transportation.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.620
It's more than all our electricity.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.245
It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.

00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:03.355
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.675
of any human activity in the world.

00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:08.301
And yet, we don't talk about it very much.

00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:11.354
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture

00:09:11.354 --> 00:09:13.491
dominating our planet,

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:15.849
whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,

00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:17.957
70 percent of the water we use,

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:20.682
30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:23.531
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.994
around the world simply by using fertilizers,

00:09:25.994 --> 00:09:28.765
causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:31.482
lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest

00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:34.157
driver of biodiversity loss.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.258
So without a doubt, agriculture is

00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:39.938
the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet

00:09:39.938 --> 00:09:42.557
since the end of the ice age. No question.

00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:45.537
And it rivals climate change in importance.

00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:48.462
And they're both happening at the same time.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:50.834
But what's really important here to remember is that

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:54.102
it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.

00:09:54.102 --> 00:09:56.282
In fact, we completely depend on it.

00:09:56.282 --> 00:10:00.722
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.

00:10:00.722 --> 00:10:02.866
We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:06.722
fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:09.458
in the world today, and if anything,

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.488
we're going to have the demands on agriculture

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:14.026
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.257
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of

00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:19.250
growing population. We're seven billion people today

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.450
heading towards at least nine,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.242
probably nine and a half before we're done.

00:10:24.242 --> 00:10:26.619
More importantly, changing diets.

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:29.666
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:32.733
we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:36.194
which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.

00:10:36.194 --> 00:10:40.116
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:43.317
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,

00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:46.790
where we have to replace oil with other energy sources

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.361
that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels

00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:51.140
and bio-energy sources.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.893
So you put these together. It's really hard to see

00:10:53.893 --> 00:10:56.245
how we're going to get to the rest of the century

00:10:56.245 --> 00:11:00.573
without at least doubling global agricultural production.

00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:02.522
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:05.315
double global ag production around the world?

00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:08.003
Well, we could try to farm more land.

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:10.802
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where

00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:14.296
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:17.244
based on soils and climate, assuming climate change

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.085
doesn't disrupt too much of this,

00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:20.973
which is not a good assumption.

00:11:20.973 --> 00:11:23.162
We could farm more land, but the problem is

00:11:23.162 --> 00:11:26.143
the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.

00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.181
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,

00:11:28.181 --> 00:11:30.615
things we want to protect.

00:11:30.615 --> 00:11:33.439
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:34.757
but we'd better not,

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:38.423
because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.

00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:40.807
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint

00:11:40.807 --> 00:11:44.592
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.

00:11:44.592 --> 00:11:46.992
This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places

00:11:46.992 --> 00:11:49.559
in the world where we could improve yields

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.825
without harming the environment.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:54.226
The green areas here show where corn yields,

00:11:54.226 --> 00:11:56.376
just showing corn as an example,

00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:58.977
are already really high, probably the maximum you could

00:11:58.977 --> 00:12:01.855
find on Earth today for that climate and soil,

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:04.206
but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:06.720
we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.060
you should be able to get.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.378
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,

00:12:10.378 --> 00:12:13.238
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union

00:12:13.238 --> 00:12:15.479
and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,

00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:17.703
is still a mess agriculturally.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.336
Now, this would require nutrients and water.

00:12:20.336 --> 00:12:22.469
It's going to either be organic or conventional

00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:24.282
or some mix of the two to deliver that.

00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:26.447
Plants need water and nutrients.

00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:29.655
But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:31.935
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:34.544
to meeting the food security needs of the future

00:12:34.544 --> 00:12:37.807
and the environmental security needs of the future.

00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:40.821
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:44.530
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.060
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.022
We can grow food in the background --

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.483
that's a soybean field â

00:12:50.483 --> 00:12:53.610
and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.128
but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing

00:12:56.128 --> 00:12:59.125
a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.133
In the foreground, we have this prairie

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:02.691
that's wonderful from the environmental side,

00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:05.895
but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:08.432
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together

00:13:08.432 --> 00:13:12.542
into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.753
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.985
"Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food,

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:22.733
local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:25.500
and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.573
but not any one of these is a silver bullet.

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:31.533
In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:34.045
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:36.363
and you've got something really powerful,

00:13:36.363 --> 00:13:38.763
but we need to put them together.

00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:41.296
So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind

00:13:41.296 --> 00:13:43.980
of agriculture that blends the best ideas

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.085
of commercial agriculture and the green revolution

00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:50.637
with the best ideas of organic farming and local food

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:54.045
and the best ideas of environmental conservation,

00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:55.850
not to have them fighting each other but to have them

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.599
collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:04.317
something I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:07.301
Now, having this conversation has been really hard,

00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:09.413
and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points

00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:11.716
to people to reduce the controversy,

00:14:11.716 --> 00:14:13.216
to increase the collaboration.

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:15.763
I want to show you a short video that does kind of show

00:14:15.763 --> 00:14:18.093
our efforts right now to bring these sides together

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:21.819
into a single conversation. So let me show you that.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:25.480
(Music)

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.137
("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.578
(Music)

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.226
("The world population is growing

00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:35.239
by 75 million people each year.

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:37.672
That's almost the size of Germany.

00:14:37.672 --> 00:14:40.615
Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:43.305
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:45.073
And we all need food.

00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.424
But how?

00:14:46.424 --> 00:14:49.312
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:52.557
We already know climate change is a big problem.

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:53.807
But it's not the only problem.

00:14:53.807 --> 00:14:56.729
We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.277
A global crisis in agriculture.

00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:05.536
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.

00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:08.985
More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.

00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:10.991
Global croplands cover 16 million kmÂ².

00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:14.184
That's almost the size of South America.

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:15.979
Global pastures cover 30 million kmÂ².

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:18.054
That's the size of Africa.

00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:22.770
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.482
Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.

00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:30.856
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.

00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:34.638
That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.

00:15:34.638 --> 00:15:37.619
Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:39.643
Some dry up altogether.

00:15:39.643 --> 00:15:43.627
Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.

00:15:43.627 --> 00:15:47.250
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.133
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:52.389
The consequence?

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:54.373
Widespread water pollution

00:15:54.373 --> 00:15:56.535
and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.

00:15:56.535 --> 00:16:00.909
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:03.336
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:06.029
That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,

00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:09.005
or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.

00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:11.373
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,

00:16:11.373 --> 00:16:12.749
methane from animals and rice fields,

00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:14.581
and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.

00:16:14.581 --> 00:16:17.836
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:21.367
And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.

00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:22.873
Here's the dilemma...

00:16:22.873 --> 00:16:27.228
As the world grows by several billion more people,

00:16:27.228 --> 00:16:31.812
We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.

00:16:31.812 --> 00:16:33.208
So where do we go from here?

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:36.011
We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.

00:16:36.011 --> 00:16:37.819
We need to invest in real solutions:

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:42.157
incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,

00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:45.818
gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.

00:16:45.818 --> 00:16:48.024
We need everyone at the table.

00:16:48.024 --> 00:16:49.974
Advocates of commercial agriculture,

00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:51.121
environmental conservation,

00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:52.582
and organic farming...

00:16:52.582 --> 00:16:54.617
must work together.

00:16:54.617 --> 00:16:56.175
There is no single solution.

00:16:56.191 --> 00:16:57.800
We need collaboration,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.236
imagination,

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:00.014
determination,

00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:03.673
because failure is not an option.

00:17:03.673 --> 00:17:07.370
How do we feed the world without destroying it?

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.236
Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges

00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:12.346
in all of human history today:

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:15.020
the need to feed nine billion people

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.774
and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,

00:17:18.774 --> 00:17:20.475
at the same time protecting our planet

00:17:20.475 --> 00:17:23.288
for this and future generations.

00:17:23.288 --> 00:17:24.804
This is going to be one of the hardest things

00:17:24.804 --> 00:17:26.675
we ever have done in human history,

00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:29.925
and we absolutely have to get it right,

00:17:29.925 --> 00:17:34.262
and we have to get it right on our first and only try.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:38.237
So thanks very much. (Applause)
