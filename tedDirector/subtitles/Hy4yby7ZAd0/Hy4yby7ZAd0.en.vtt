00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
From all outward appearances,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
John had everything going for him.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
He had just signed the contract

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
to sell his New York apartment

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
at a six-figure profit,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and he'd only owned it for five years.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
The school where he graduated from with his master's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
had just offered him a teaching appointment,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
which meant not only a salary,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
but benefits for the first time in ages.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And yet, despite everything going really well for John,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
he was struggling,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
fighting addiction and a gripping depression.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
On the night of June 11th, 2003,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
he climbed up to the edge

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Remarkably --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
no, miraculously --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
he lived.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
The fall shattered his right arm,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
broke every rib that he had,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
punctured his lung,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and he drifted in and out of consciousness

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
as he drifted down the East River,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
under the Brooklyn Bridge

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
where passengers on the ferry

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
heard his cries of pain,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
contacted the boat's captain

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
who contacted the Coast Guard

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
who fished him out of the East River

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and took him to Bellevue Hospital.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And that's actually where our story begins.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Because once John committed himself

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
to putting his life back together --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
first physically, then emotionally,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and then spiritually --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
he found that there were very few resources available

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to someone who has attempted to end their life

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in the way that he did.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Research shows

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
that 19 out of 20 people

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
who attempt suicide

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
will fail.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
But the people who fail

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
are 37 times more likely to succeed

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
the second time.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
This truly is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
an at-risk population

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
with very few resources to support them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And what happens

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
when people try to assemble themselves back into life,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
because of our taboos around suicide,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
we're not sure what to say,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and so quite often we say nothing.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And that furthers the isolation

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that people like John found themselves in.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I know John's story very well

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
because I'm John.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And this is, today,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
the first time in any sort of public setting

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I've ever acknowledged

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
the journey that I have been on.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and a good friend last year to suicide,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and sitting last year at TEDActive,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I knew that I needed to step out of my silence

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and past my taboos

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
to talk about an idea worth spreading --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and that is that people

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
who have made the difficult choice

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
to come back to life

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
need more resources and need our help.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It gets way better.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And I'm choosing to come out

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
of a totally different kind of closet today

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
to encourage you, to urge you,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that if you are someone

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
who has contemplated or attempted suicide,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
or you know somebody who has,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
talk about it; get help.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
It's a conversation worth having

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and an idea worth spreading.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Thank you.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
(Applause)
