00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.888
OK, first, some introductions.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.142
My mom, Jennie, took this picture.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.497
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:26.283
And on his left, my sisters:

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.791
Mary Catherine, Judith Ann,
Theresa Marie.

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:34.739
John Patrick's sitting on his lap
and Kevin Michael's on his right.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.212
And in the pale-blue windbreaker,

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:40.381
Susan Diane. Me.

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.619
I loved growing up in a big family.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.832
And one of my favorite things
was picking names.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.369
But by the time child
number seven came along,

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.710
we had nearly run out of middle names.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:58.917
It was a long deliberation

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.948
before we finally settled
on Jennifer Bridget.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:07.084
Every parent in this audience

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.732
knows the joy and excitement

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:12.194
of picking a new baby's name.

00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:14.835
And I was excited and thrilled

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.562
to help my mom in that special
ceremonial moment.

00:01:19.824 --> 00:01:21.863
But it's not like that everywhere.

00:01:23.163 --> 00:01:25.846
I travel a lot and I see a lot.

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:29.366
But it took me by surprise to learn

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.569
in an area of Ethiopia,

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:35.274
parents delay picking the names
for their new babies

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:36.849
by a month or more.

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:39.325
Why delay?

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:43.645
Why not take advantage
of this special ceremonial time?

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:46.820
Well, they delay because they're afraid.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.224
They're afraid their baby will die.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.230
And this loss might be a little more
bearable without a name.

00:01:57.248 --> 00:02:01.153
A face without a name might help them feel

00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:03.946
just a little less attached.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.496
So here we are in one part of the world --

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.261
a time of joy, excitement,
dreaming of the future of that child --

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:15.155
while in another world,

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.099
parents are filled with dread,

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:21.698
not daring to dream
of a future for their child

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.588
beyond a few precious weeks.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.185
How can that be?

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.674
How can it be that 2.6 million babies

00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:34.492
die around the world

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:36.936
before they're even one month old?

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:39.901
2.6 million.

00:02:41.034 --> 00:02:43.353
That's the population of Vancouver.

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:46.631
And the shocking thing is:

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:48.341
Why?

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:52.135
In too many cases, we simply don't know.

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:57.271
Now, I remember recently seeing
an updated pie chart.

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:59.463
And the pie chart was labeled,

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:02.999
"Causes of death in children
under five worldwide."

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:07.883
And there was a pretty big section
of that pie chart, about 40 percent --

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:11.269
40 percent was labeled "neonatal."

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:14.454
Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.687
Neonatal is simply an adjective,

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.579
an adjective that means that the child
is less than one month old.

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:28.013
For me, "neonatal" said:
"We have no idea."

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.270
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.787
I want to fix things.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.445
But you can't fix
what you can't define.

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:42.995
So our first step in restoring
the dreams of those parents

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.196
is to answer the question:

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.169
Why are babies dying?

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.094
So today, I want to talk
about a new approach,

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:54.055
an approach that I feel

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.763
will not only help us
know why babies are dying,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:02.744
but is beginning to completely transform

00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:04.552
the whole field of global health.

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:09.361
It's called "Precision Public Health."

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:15.615
For me, precision medicine comes
from a very special place.

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:19.701
I trained as a cancer doctor,
an oncologist.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.697
I got into it because I wanted
to help people feel better.

00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.296
But too often my treatments
made them feel worse.

00:04:29.277 --> 00:04:34.013
I still remember young women
being driven to my clinic

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.744
by their moms --

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:41.410
adults, who had to be helped
into my exam room by their mothers.

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.951
They were so weak

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:46.204
from the treatment I had given them.

00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:51.483
But at the time, in those front lines
in the war on cancer,

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.141
we had few tools.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.722
And the tools we did have
couldn't differentiate

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:01.020
between the cancer cells
that we wanted to hit hard

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.109
and those healthy cells
that we wanted to preserve.

00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:09.618
And so the side effects that you're
all very familiar with --

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.476
hair loss, being sick to your stomach,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.614
having a suppressed immune system,
so infection was a constant threat --

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.964
were always surrounding us.

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:23.694
And then I moved
to the biotechnology industry.

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:28.349
And I got to work on a new approach
for breast cancer patients

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:33.374
that could do a better job
of telling the healthy cells

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:35.740
from the unhealthy or cancer cells.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.589
It's a drug called Herceptin.

00:05:39.343 --> 00:05:42.579
And what Herceptin allowed us to do

00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:47.814
is to precisely target
HER2-positive breast cancer,

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:51.718
at the time, the scariest
form of breast cancer.

00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:55.926
And that precision let us
hit hard the cancer cells,

00:05:56.727 --> 00:06:00.817
while sparing and being more
gentle on the normal cells.

00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:04.157
A huge breakthrough.

00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:06.261
It felt like a miracle,

00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:10.040
so much so that today,

00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:12.595
we're harnessing all those tools --

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:18.680
big data, consumer monitoring,
gene sequencing and more --

00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:22.025
to tackle a broad variety of diseases.

00:06:23.044 --> 00:06:28.113
That's allowing us to target individuals

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.421
with the right remedies at the right time.

00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:37.191
Precision medicine
revolutionized cancer therapy.

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:39.257
Everything changed.

00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:43.308
And I want everything to change again.

00:06:44.214 --> 00:06:46.466
So I've been asking myself:

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.308
Why should we limit

00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:53.141
this smarter, more precise,
better way to tackle diseases

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:54.328
to the rich world?

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.617
Now, don't misunderstand me --

00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:00.967
I'm not talking about bringing
expensive medicines like Herceptin

00:07:00.991 --> 00:07:02.876
to the developing world,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.150
although I'd actually kind of like that.

00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:07.672
What I am talking about

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:12.064
is moving from this precise
targeting for individuals

00:07:12.088 --> 00:07:14.731
to tackle public health problems

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:16.496
in populations.

00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:23.070
Now, OK, I know probably
you're thinking, "She's crazy.

00:07:23.094 --> 00:07:26.086
You can't do that. That's too ambitious."

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.332
But here's the thing:

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.478
we're already doing this in a limited way,

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:35.572
and it's already starting
to make a big difference.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.135
So here's what's happening.

00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:41.542
Now, I told you I trained
as a cancer doctor.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:46.015
But like many, many doctors
who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:48.130
I also trained as an AIDS doctor.

00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:50.685
It was a terrible time.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.542
AIDS was a death sentence.

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:56.011
All my patients died.

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:59.233
Now, things are better,

00:07:59.257 --> 00:08:03.836
but HIV/AIDS remains
a terrible global challenge.

00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:09.924
Worldwide, about 17 million women
are living with HIV.

00:08:10.744 --> 00:08:14.041
We know that when these women
become pregnant,

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:16.678
they can transfer the virus to their baby.

00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:20.803
We also know in the absence of therapy,

00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:24.310
half those babies will not survive
until the age of two.

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:30.583
But we know that antiretroviral therapy
can virtually guarantee

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:33.558
that she will not transmit
the virus to the baby.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.241
So what do we do?

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:40.270
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach,
kind of like that blast of chemo,

00:08:40.294 --> 00:08:43.474
would mean we test and treat
every pregnant woman in the world.

00:08:43.952 --> 00:08:45.333
That would do the job.

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:48.141
But it's just not practical.

00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:54.863
So instead, we target those areas
where HIV rates are the highest.

00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:59.821
We know in certain countries
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:04.007
we can test and treat pregnant women
where rates are highest.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.952
This precision approach
to a public health problem

00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:10.377
has cut by nearly half

00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:13.156
HIV transmission from mothers to baby

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.014
in the last five years.

00:09:15.485 --> 00:09:19.850
(Applause)

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:26.007
Screening pregnant women
in certain areas in the developing world

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.135
is a powerful example

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:34.674
of how precision public health
can change things on a big scale.

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:37.603
So ...

00:09:38.213 --> 00:09:39.390
How do we do that?

00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:41.579
We can do that because we know.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:44.214
We know who to target,

00:09:44.238 --> 00:09:45.925
what to target,

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:48.241
where to target and how to target.

00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:52.987
And that, for me, are the important 
elements of precision public health:

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.068
who, what, where and how.

00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:01.715
But let's go back
to the 2.6 million babies

00:10:01.739 --> 00:10:03.756
who die before they're one month old.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.040
Here's the problem: we just don't know.

00:10:06.753 --> 00:10:09.217
It may seem unbelievable,

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:14.104
but the way we figure out
the causes of infant mortality

00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:17.139
in those countries
with the highest infant mortality

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:19.159
is a conversation with mom.

00:10:19.948 --> 00:10:24.326
A health worker asks a mom
who has just lost her child,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.019
"Was the baby vomiting?
Did they have a fever?"

00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:29.992
And that conversation may take place

00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:33.927
as long as three months
after the baby has died.

00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:38.099
Now, put yourself
in the shoes of that mom.

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:43.195
It's a heartbreaking,
excruciating conversation.

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.762
And even worse -- it's not that helpful,

00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:50.588
because we might know
there was a fever or vomiting,

00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:52.325
but we don't know why.

00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:56.653
So in the absence of knowing
that knowledge,

00:10:56.677 --> 00:10:59.659
we cannot prevent that mom, that family,

00:10:59.683 --> 00:11:01.781
or other families in that community

00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:03.753
from suffering the same tragedy.

00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:08.278
But what if we applied
a precision public health approach?

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:10.458
Let's say, for example,

00:11:10.482 --> 00:11:13.416
we find out in certain areas of Africa

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.186
that babies are dying
because of a bacterial infection

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.757
transferred from the mother to the baby,

00:11:19.781 --> 00:11:22.254
known as Group B streptococcus.

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:28.511
In the absence of treatment,
mom has a seven times higher chance

00:11:28.535 --> 00:11:30.735
that her next baby will die.

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:36.025
Once we define the problem,
we can prevent that death

00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:40.132
with something as cheap
and safe as penicillin.

00:11:41.894 --> 00:11:44.445
We can do that because then we'll know.

00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:46.566
And that's the point:

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.026
once we know, we can bring
the right interventions

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.589
to the right population
in the right places

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.036
to save lives.

00:11:56.973 --> 00:12:00.725
With this approach,
and with these interventions

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:02.774
and others like them,

00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:04.509
I have no doubt

00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:07.080
that a precision public health approach

00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:10.590
can help our world achieve
our 15-year goal.

00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:15.752
And that would translate
into a million babies' lives saved

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.413
every single year.

00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:22.563
One million babies every single year.

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:25.548
And why would we stop there?

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:29.616
A much more powerful approach
to public health --

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.405
imagine what might be possible.

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:36.301
Why couldn't we more effectively
tackle malnutrition?

00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:41.920
Why wouldn't we prevent
cervical cancer in women?

00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:45.650
And why not eradicate malaria?

00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:46.675
(Applause)

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:47.912
Yes, clap for that!

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:51.864
(Applause)

00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:54.731
So, you know, I live
in two different worlds,

00:12:54.755 --> 00:12:57.963
one world populated by scientists,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.487
and another world populated
by public health professionals.

00:13:03.319 --> 00:13:05.747
The promise of precision public health

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.095
is to bring these two worlds together.

00:13:08.876 --> 00:13:12.421
But you know, we all live in two worlds:

00:13:13.254 --> 00:13:16.333
the rich world and the poor world.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.610
And what I'm most excited about
about precision public health

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.093
is bridging these two worlds.

00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:28.071
Every day in the rich world,

00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:31.350
we're bringing incredible
talent and tools --

00:13:31.374 --> 00:13:33.333
everything at our disposal --

00:13:33.357 --> 00:13:38.270
to precisely target diseases
in ways I never imagined

00:13:38.294 --> 00:13:40.128
would be possible.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:45.168
Surely, we can tap into
that kind of talent and tools

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:47.630
to stop babies dying in the poor world.

00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:51.250
If we did,

00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:55.331
then every parent would have
the confidence

00:13:55.355 --> 00:13:59.683
to name their child
the moment that child is born,

00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:05.931
daring to dream that that child's life
will be measured in decades,

00:14:06.498 --> 00:14:07.742
not days.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.481
Thank you.

00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:17.137
(Applause)
