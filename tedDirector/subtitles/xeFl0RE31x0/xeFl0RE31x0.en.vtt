00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
If you are a blind child in India,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
you will very likely have to contend with

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
at least two big pieces of bad news.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
The first bad news

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
is that the chances of getting treatment

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
are extremely slim to none,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and that's because most of the blindness

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
alleviation programs in the country

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
are focused on adults,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and there are very, very few hospitals

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that are actually equipped to treat children.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.260
In fact, if you were to be treated,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
you might well end up being treated

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
by a person who has no medical credentials

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
This is a three-year-old orphan girl

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
who had cataracts.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
So, her caretakers took her

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to the village medicine man,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and instead of suggesting to the caretakers

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that the girl be taken to a hospital,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
the person decided to burn her abdomen

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
with red-hot iron bars

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to drive out the demons.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
The second piece of bad news

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
will be delivered to you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
by neuroscientists, who will tell you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that if you are older than four or five years of age,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that even if you have your eye corrected,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
the chances of your brain learning how to see

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
are very, very slim --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
again, slim or none.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So when I heard these two things,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
it troubled me deeply,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
both because of personal reasons

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and scientific reasons.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So let me first start with the personal reason.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
That's my son, Darius.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
As a new father,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I have a qualitatively different sense

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
of just how delicate babies are,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
what our obligations are towards them

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and how much love

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
we can feel towards a child.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I would move heaven and earth

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
in order to get treatment for Darius,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and for me to be told

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that there might be other Dariuses

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
who are not getting treatment,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
that's just viscerally wrong.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So that's the personal reason.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Scientific reason is that this notion

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
from neuroscience of critical periods --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that if the brain is older

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
than four or five years of age,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
it loses its ability to learn --

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that doesn't sit well with me,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
because I don't think that idea

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
has been tested adequately.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The birth of the idea is from

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
two researchers who were at Harvard,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
for their studies of visual physiology,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
which are remarkably beautiful studies,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
but I believe some of their work

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
has been extrapolated

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
into the human domain prematurely.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
So, they did their work with kittens,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
with different kinds of deprivation regiments,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
and those studies,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
which date back to the '60s,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
are now being applied to human children.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So I felt that I needed to do two things.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
One: provide care

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to children who are currently

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
being deprived of treatment.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
That's the humanitarian mission.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And the scientific mission would be

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to test the limits

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
of visual plasticity.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And these two missions, as you can tell,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
in fact, one would be impossible without the other.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So, to implement

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
these twin missions,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Prakash, as many of you know,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
is the Sanskrit word for light,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and the idea is that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
in bringing light into the lives of children,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
we also have a chance

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
of shedding light on some of the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
deepest mysteries of neuroscience.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
it's actually derived from

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
The Prakash, the overall effort

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
has three components:

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
outreach, to identify children in need of care;

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
medical treatment; and in subsequent study.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And I want to show you a short video clip

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that illustrates the first two components of this work.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
This is an outreach station

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
conducted at a school for the blind.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.260
(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
many children have permanent conditions.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
That's a case of microphthalmos,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
which is malformed eyes,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and that's a permanent condition;

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
it cannot be treated.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
That's an extreme of micropthalmos

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
called enophthalmos.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
But, every so often, we come across children

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
who show some residual vision,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and that is a very good sign

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
that the condition might actually be treatable.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
It has a very well-equipped

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
pediatric ophthalmic center,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
which was made possible in part

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So, eating burgers actually helps.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
eye-health in many children, and ...

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
you will see the cause of his blindness.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
are congenital cataracts,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
so opacities of the lens.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
In our eyes, the lens is clear,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
but in this child, the lens has become opaque,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and therefore he can't see the world.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Here's the eye with the opaque lens,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
the opaque lens extracted

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and an acrylic lens inserted.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And here's the same child

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
three weeks post-operation,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
with the right eye open.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.260
(Applause)

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Thank you.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that recovery is possible,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and we have now

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
provided treatment to over 200 children,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and the story repeats itself.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
After treatment, the child

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
gains significant functionality.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
In fact, the story holds true

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
even if you have a person who got sight

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
after several years of deprivation.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We did a paper a few years ago

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and she got her sight late in life,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and her vision is remarkable at this age.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
I should add a tragic postscript to this --

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
she died two years ago

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
in a bus accident.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
unknown, but inspiring story.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
So when we started finding these results,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
in the scientific and the popular press.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Here's an article in Nature

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
that profiled this work,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and another one in Time.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
that recovery is feasible,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
despite extended visual deprivation.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
The next obvious question to ask:

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
What is the process of recovery?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
So, the way we study that is,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
The child is provided treatment,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and I want to stress that the treatment

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
is completely unconditional;

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
there is no quid pro quo.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
We treat many more children then we actually work with.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Every child who needs treatment is treated.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
After treatment, about every week,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
we run the child

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
on a battery of simple visual tests

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
in order to see how their visual skills

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
are coming on line.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And we try to do this for as long as possible.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
This arc of development

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
gives us unprecedented

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and extremely valuable information

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
about how the scaffolding of vision

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
gets set up.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
What might be the causal connections

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
between the early developing skills

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
and the later developing ones?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And we've used this general approach to study

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
many different visual proficiencies,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.260
but I want to highlight one particular one,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and that is image parsing into objects.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
be it a real image or a synthetic image,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
it's made up of little regions

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that you see in the middle column,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
regions of different colors, different luminances.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
The brain has this complex task

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
of putting together, integrating,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
subsets of these regions

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
into something that's more meaningful,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
into what we would consider to be objects,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
as you see on the right.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
And nobody knows how this integration happens,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
So, here's what happens

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
very soon after the onset of sight.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
running the experiment with him.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
but you get a general sense

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
If you show him real world images,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
if you show others like him real world images,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
they are unable to recognize most of the objects

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
because the world to them is over-fragmented;

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
it's made up of a collage, a patchwork,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
of regions of different colors and luminances.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And that's what's indicated in the green outlines.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
When you ask them,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,"

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
these are the regions that they point to.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
So the world is this complex

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
patchwork of regions.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Even the shadow on the ball

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
becomes its own object.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Interestingly enough,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
you give them a few months,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and this is what happens.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Doctor: How many are these?

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Patient: These are two things.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Doctor: What are their shapes?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Patient: Their shapes ...

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
This one is a circle,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and this

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
is a square.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And the question is:

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
What underlies this transformation?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
It's a profound question,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and what's even more amazing is how simple

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
the answer is.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
The answer lies in motion

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Doctor: What shape do you see here?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Patient: I can't make it out.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Doctor: Now?

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Patient: Triangle.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Doctor: How many things are these?

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Now, how many things are these?

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Patient: Two.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Doctor: What are these things?

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Patient: A square and a circle.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
The one thing the visual system needs

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
in order to begin parsing the world

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
is dynamic information.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
So the inference we are deriving from this,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and several such experiments,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
is that dynamic information processing,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
or motion processing,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
serves as the bedrock for building

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.260
the rest of the complexity of visual processing;

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
it leads to visual integration

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and eventually to recognition.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
This simple idea has far reaching implications.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And let me just quickly mention two,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
one, drawing from the domain of engineering,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and one from the clinic.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
So, from the perspective of engineering,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
we can ask: Goven that we know

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
that motion is so important for the human visual system,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
can we use this as a recipe

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
for constructing machine-based vision systems

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
by a human programmer?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And that's what we're trying to do.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
whatever basic knowledge you gain.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
So we are creating Dylan,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
which is a computational system

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
with an ambitious goal

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
of taking in visual inputs

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
of the same kind that a human child would receive,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
and autonomously discovering:

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
What are the objects in this visual input?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Here, I'm just going to talk about

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
how we test Dylan.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
The way we test Dylan is by giving it

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
inputs, as I said, of the same kind

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
So, I thought,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
could we have Darius

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
serve as our babycam carrier,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
So that's what we did.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:14:00.260
(Laughter)

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
I had to have long conversations with my wife.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:08.260
(Laughter)

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
In fact, Pam, if you're watching this,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
please forgive me.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
So, we modified the optics of the camera

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
As some of you might know,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
babyies are born pretty much legally blind.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
babies' acuity is like 20/800,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
so they are looking at the world

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
in a very, very blurry fashion.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:50.260
(Laughter)

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
(Applause)

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Thankfully, there isn't any audio

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
to go with this.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
What's amazing is that working with such

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
highly degraded input,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
the baby, very quickly, is able

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
to discover meaning in such input.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
But then two or three days afterward,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
babies begin to pay attention

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
to their mother's or their father's face.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and using this mantra of motion,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
Dylan actually can do that.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So, given that kind of video input,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
Dylan can begin to extract patterns

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
that include faces.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
So, it's an important demonstration

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
of the power of motion.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Visual integration has been associated with autism

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
by several researchers.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
When we saw that, we asked:

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Could the impairment in visual integration

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
be the manifestation of something underneath,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Because, if that hypothesis were to be true,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
it would have massive repercussions in our understanding

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
of what's causing the many different aspects

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
of the autism phenotype.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
What you're going to see are

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
video clips of two children -- one neurotypical,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
one with autism, playing Pong.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
In red are the eye movement traces.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
is that the child is able to make cues

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
of the dynamic information

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
to predict where the ball is going to go.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Even before the ball gets to a place,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
the child is already looking there.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Contrast this with a child

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
with autism playing the same game.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Instead of anticipating,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
the child always follows where the ball has been.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
The efficiency of the use

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
of dynamic information

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
seems to be significantly compromised in autism.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
So we are pursuing this line of work

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
and hopefully we'll have

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
more results to report soon.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
Looking ahead, if you think of this disk

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
as representing all of the children

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
we've treated so far,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
this is the magnitude of the problem.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
The red dots are the children we have not treated.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
and in order to expand the scope of the project,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
we are planning on launching

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
The Prakash Center for Children,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
a school for the children we are treating

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
and also a cutting-edge research facility.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
The Prakash Center will integrate health care,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
education and research in a way

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that truly creates the whole

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
to be greater than the sum of the parts.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
it's had an impact in multiple areas,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
ranging from basic neuroscience

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
plasticity and learning in the brain,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.260
to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
the development of autonomous machine vision systems,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
education of the undergraduate and graduate students,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
and most importantly in the alleviation

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
of childhood blindness.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
And for my students and I, it's been

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
just a phenomenal experience

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.260
because we have gotten to do interesting research,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
while at the same time

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
helping the many children that we have worked with.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
(Applause)
