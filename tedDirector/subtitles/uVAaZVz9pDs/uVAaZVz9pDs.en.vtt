00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to fly to Mars or even Pandora,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
as much fun as that may be.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I'm talking about

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
the concept of using suspended animation

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
to help people out in trauma.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So what do I mean

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
when I say "suspended animation"?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It is the process by which

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
animals de-animate,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
appear dead

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and then can wake up again without being harmed.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
OK, so here is the sort of big idea:

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
If you look out at nature,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
you find that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
as you tend to see suspended animation,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
you tend to see immortality.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And so, what I'm going to tell you about

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.260
is a way to tell a person who's in trauma --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
find a way to de-animate them a bit

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
so they're a little more immortal

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
when they have that heart attack.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
An example of an organism or two

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
that happens to be quite immortal

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
would be plant seeds

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
or bacterial spores.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
These creatures are

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
some of the most immortal life forms on our planet,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and they tend to spend most of their time

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in suspended animation.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to exist as individual cells

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that are alive, but in suspended animation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
for as long as 250 million years.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260
To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I want to bring it close to home.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
In the immortal germ line

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
of human beings --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
So then there's also my favorite example

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of suspended animation.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
This is Sea-Monkeys.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Those of you with children,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
you know about them.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
You go to the pet store or the toy store,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and you can buy these things.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You just open the bag, and you just dump them

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
into the plastic aquarium,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I was interested in what was going on in the bag,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the bag on the toy store shelf

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
where those shrimp sat

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
in suspended animation indefinitely.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So these ideas of suspended animation

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Occasionally, human beings

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
are briefly de-animated,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
that interest me the most

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
are those having to do with the cold.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
that was trapped in an icy waterfall,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and she was there for two hours before they extracted her.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
She was extremely cold,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and she had no heartbeat --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Seven hours later,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
still without a heartbeat,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
they brought her back to life, and she went on to be

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
the head radiologist

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
in the hospital that treated her.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
A couple of years later --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
so I get really excited about these things --

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
about a couple of years later,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And they found her hours later,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
frozen, lifeless,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and they brought her back to life.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
There was a 65-year-old woman

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
in Duluth, Minnesota last year

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that was found frozen and without a pulse

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
in her front yard one morning in the winter,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and they brought her back to life.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
She got cranky and just went home.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
(Laughter)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
So, these are miracles, right?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
These are truly miraculous things that happen.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Doctors have a saying

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And it's true. It's true.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
In the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
there was a study published that showed

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
that with appropriate rewarming,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
That's over 50 percent.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So what I was trying to do is think of a way

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that we could study

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
suspended animation

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to think about a way

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to reproduce, maybe,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
what happened to the skier.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Well, I have to tell you something very odd,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and that is that being exposed to low oxygen

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
does not always kill.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and if we reduce the oxygen concentration,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
we will all be dead.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
these little garden worms, nematodes --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And here's the thing that should freak you out.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.260
by 100 times, to 10 parts per million,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
they were not dead,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
they were in suspended animation,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and we could bring them back to life without any harm.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And this precise oxygen concentration,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
10 parts per million,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
that caused suspended animation,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
is conserved.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
One of the creatures we see it in

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
is a fish.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
of suspended animation like you would a light switch.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
So this was pretty shocking to me,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
that we could do this.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And so I was wondering, when we were trying

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to reproduce the work with the skier,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
that we noticed that, of course,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
she had no oxygen consumption,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
But, of course, she was also extremely cold.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So we wondered what would happen

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And so, what we found out

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
was that, if you take animals

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that are animated like you and I,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
now they're dead.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
But if you have them in suspended animation,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and move them into the cold, they're all alive.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And there's the very important thing there:

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
If you want to survive the cold,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
you ought to be suspended. Right?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
It's a really good thing.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And so, we were thinking about that,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
about this relationship between these things,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And so we wondered: Might there be some agent

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that is in us, something that we make ourselves,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
in such a way as to be able to survive

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
You know?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
I should mention briefly here

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
that physiology textbooks that you can read about

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
until we take our last dying breath --

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that's when we're newborn to when we're dead --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
we cannot reduce our metabolic rate

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
below what's called a standard,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or basal metabolic rate.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But I knew that there were examples

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
of creatures, also mammals,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
that do reduce their metabolic rate

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
such as ground squirrels and bears,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
they reduce their metabolic rate

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
in the wintertime when they hibernate.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that might induce such a state in us?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And so, we went looking for such things.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Well, we had a lot of them.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
We tried many different chemicals and agents,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and we failed over and over again.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So, one time, I was at home

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
watching television on the couch

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
while my wife was putting our child to bed,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and I was watching a television show.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
It was a television show --

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
it was a NOVA show on PBS --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
about caves in New Mexico.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
It's filled with this toxic gas,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
hydrogen sulfide.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We make it ourselves.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
The highest concentration is in our brains.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
Yet, it was used

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
In fact, in chemical accidents,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
hydrogen sulfide is known to --

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
you appear dead,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
if they do that quickly.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
So, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
(Laughter)

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Now, it's post-9/11 America,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
and when you go into the research institute,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
and you say, "Hi.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I'd like to buy some concentrated,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
compressed gas cylinders

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
of a lethal gas

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
because I have these ideas, see,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
about wanting to suspend people.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
It's really going to be OK."

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So that's kind of a tough day,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
but I said, "There really is

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.260
some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
As I said, this agent is in us,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and, in fact, here's a curious thing,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
it binds to the very place inside of your cells

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
where oxygen binds, and where you burn it,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and that you do this burning to live.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.260
might we be able to give a person

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
some hydrogen sulfide,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and might it be able to occupy that place

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And because you can't bind the oxygen,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
maybe you wouldn't consume it,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
I mean, who knows?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
So -- (Laughter)

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
So, there's the bit about the dopamine

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and you might suggest that was it.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And so, we wanted to find out

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
might we be able to use

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and we wanted to see whether we could

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
reproduce this skier in a mammal.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
by actually burning more oxygen.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
So, it was interesting for us

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
when we applied hydrogen sulfide

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
to a mouse when it was also cold

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
because what happened is the core temperature

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
of the mouse got cold.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
It stopped moving.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It appeared dead.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Its oxygen consumption rate

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
fell by tenfold.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And here's the really important point.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
It's rapidly metabolized,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and all you have to do after six hours of being

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
in this state of de-animation

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
is simply put the thing out in room air,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Now, this was cosmic.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Really. Because we had found a way

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
to de-animate a mammal,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and it didn't hurt it.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Now, we'd found a way to reduce

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
its oxygen consumption

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Now, in this state of de-animation,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
it could not go out dancing,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
but it was not dead,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and it was not harmed.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
So we started to think: Is this the agent

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
that might have been present in the skier,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and might have she had more of it than someone else,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and might that have been able to reduce

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
her demand for oxygen

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
before she got so cold that

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
she otherwise would have died,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
as we found out with our worm experiments?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
So, we wondered:

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Can we do anything useful

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
with this capacity to

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
control metabolic flexibility?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And one of the things we wondered --

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
I'm sure some of you out there are economists,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and you know all about supply and demand.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And when supply is equal to demand,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
everything's fine,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
but when supply falls,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
in this case of oxygen,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and demand stays high, you're dead.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
So, what I just told you

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
is we can now reduce demand.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
We ought to be able to lower supply

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And with money we got from DARPA,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
we could show just that.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
If you give mice hydrogen sulfide,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
you can lower their demand for oxygen,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
and you can put them into oxygen concentrations

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Well this was really cool.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
We also found out that we could subject animals

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
So these proof of concept experiments

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
led me to say "I should found a company,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and we should take this out to a wider playing field."

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
I founded a company called Ikaria

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
with others' help.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And this company, the first thing it did

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
an injectable form that we could put in

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and send it out to physician scientists all over the world

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
who work on models of critical care medicine,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
and the results are incredibly positive.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
In one model of heart attack,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
animals given hydrogen sulfide

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
compared to those who got the standard of care that

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Same is true for organ failure,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.260
when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
acute respiratory distress syndrome

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
all over the world saying this is true,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.260
so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
decreases damage that you receive

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
required to get this benefit

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
are low, incredibly low.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
the metabolism of people much at all

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
to see the benefit I just mentioned,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
You don't want to be gorking people out

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
just to save them, it's really confusing.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
(Laughter)

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So, I want to say that we're in human trials.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
Now, and so --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:27.260
(Applause)

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
This has all moved very quickly,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and the mouse experiments

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
of hibernating mice happened in 2005;

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
the first human studies were done in 2008,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and we should know in a couple of years

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
whether it works or not.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
And this all happened really quickly

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
because of a lot of help from a lot of people.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
I want to mention that, first of all,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
so thank you very much.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and also others on staff,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington --

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
wonderful place to work.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
And also the wonderful scientists

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and businesspeople at Ikaria.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
One thing those people did out there

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
and they fused it with another company

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
that sells another toxic gas

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.260
that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
And this gas that is delivered in over

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
now is approved, on label,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and saves thousands of babies a year

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
from certain death.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
(Applause)

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
So it's really incredible

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
for me to be a part of this.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And I want to say that I think we're on the path

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
of understanding metabolic flexibility

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
in a fundamental way,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.260
and that in the not too distant future,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
or some related compound,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
to a person suffering severe injuries,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
and that person might de-animate a bit,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
they might become a little more immortal.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Their metabolism will fall

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:26.260
as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
to be transported to the hospital

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.260
to get the care they need.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.260
And then, after they get that care --

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
like the mouse, like the skier,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
like the 65-year-old woman --

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
they'll wake up.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
A miracle?

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
We hope not, or maybe we just hope

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
to make miracles a little more common.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:04.260
(Applause)
