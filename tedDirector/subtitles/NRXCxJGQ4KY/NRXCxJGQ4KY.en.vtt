00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:15.170
When I was preparing for this talk,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.146
I went to search for a couple of quotes

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:18.991
that I can share with you.

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.162
Good news: I found three

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.994
that I particularly liked,

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:26.472
the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:28.712
"When making your choice in life,

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.468
do not forget to live,"

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:35.000
the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.305
"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:42.830
and the third is one by Groucho Marx

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.920
who said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.252
to any club that would have me as a member."

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:53.318
Now, bad news:

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:55.429
I didn't know which one of these quotes

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.178
to choose and share with you.

00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:01.403
The sweet anxiety of choice.

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:05.446
In today's times of post-industrial capitalism,

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:09.109
choice, together with individual freedom

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.970
and the idea of self-making,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.500
has been elevated to an ideal.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.387
Now, together with this, we also have a belief

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:22.155
in endless progress.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:24.911
But the underside of this ideology

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.443
has been an increase of anxiety,

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:30.513
feelings of guilt,

00:01:30.513 --> 00:01:34.217
feelings of being inadequate,

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:38.954
feeling that we are failing in our choices.

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:42.950
Sadly, this ideology of individual choice

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.400
has prevented us from thinking about social changes.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.319
It appears that this ideology was actually

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.001
very efficient in pacifying us

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.797
as political and social thinkers.

00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.113
Instead of making social critiques,

00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:02.869
we are more and more engaging in self-critique,

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.122
sometimes to the point of self-destruction.

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:09.867
Now, how come that ideology of choice

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:11.450
is still so powerful,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.546
even among people who have

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.655
not many things to choose among?

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:20.229
How come that even people who are poor

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:24.620
very much still identify with the idea of choice,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.689
the kind of rational idea of choice

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.322
which we embrace?

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:33.340
Now, the ideology of choice is very successful

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.320
in opening for us a space to think

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.987
about some imagined future.

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:43.000
Let me give you an example.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.913
My friend Manya,

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:47.962
when she was a student at university in California,

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.660
was earning money

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.720
by working for a car dealer.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.531
Now, Manya, when she encountered

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.389
the typical customer, would debate with him

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.233
about his lifestyle,

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.956
how much he wants to spend,

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.700
how many children he has,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.973
what does he need the car for?

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:08.660
They would usually come to a good conclusion

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.214
what would be a perfect car.

00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:14.702
Now, before Manya's customer would go home

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:17.140
and think things through,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.960
she would say to him,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.745
"The car that you are buying now is perfect,

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:24.770
but in a few year's time,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.403
when your kids will be already out of the house,

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:30.370
when you will have a little bit more money,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.399
that other car will be ideal.

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.936
But what you are buying now is great."

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.293
Now, the majority of Manya's customers

00:03:39.293 --> 00:03:40.913
who came back the next day

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:43.738
bought that other car,

00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:45.795
the car they did not need,

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:48.833
the car that cost far too much money.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.769
Now, Manya became so successful in selling cars

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.671
that soon she moved on to selling airplanes.

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:59.265
(Laughter)

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:03.350
And knowing so much about
the psychology of people

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.924
prepared her well for her current job,

00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:08.755
which is that of a psychoanalyst.

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:13.278
Now, why were Manya's customers so irrational?

00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:15.775
Manya's success was that she was able

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:18.700
to open in their heads an image

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.280
of an idealized future,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190
an image of themselves

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.420
when they are already more successful, freer,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.669
and for them, choosing that other car

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.729
was as if they are coming closer to this ideal

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.578
in which it was as if Manya already saw them.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:42.981
Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.559
Choices are influenced by our unconscious,

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.398
by our community.

00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:50.328
We're often choosing

00:04:50.328 --> 00:04:52.482
by guessing, what would other people

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:55.466
think about our choice?

00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:56.671
Also we are choosing

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.040
by looking at what others are choosing.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.845
We're also guessing what is
socially acceptable choice.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.916
Now, because of this, we actually

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:08.805
even after we have already chosen,

00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:10.560
like bought a car,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.710
endlessly read reviews about cars,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.070
as if we still want to convince ourselves

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.671
that we made the right choice.

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.870
Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.951
They are linked to risks, losses.

00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:27.306
They are highly unpredictable.

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:29.415
Now, because of this,

00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:31.918
people have now more and more problems

00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:35.376
that they are not choosing anything.

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:39.207
Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:41.511
and I met a young, beautiful woman

00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:46.137
who immediately started telling
me about her anxiety over choice.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.108
She said to me, "I needed one month

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:51.154
to decide which dress to wear."

00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:53.675
Then she said, "For weeks I was researching

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.936
which hotel to stay for this one night.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:01.434
And now, I need to choose a sperm donor."

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:04.201
(Laughter)

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:07.700
I looked at this woman in shock.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.737
"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:14.911
She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:19.736
and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."

00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:24.142
Now choice, because it's linked to risk,

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:26.419
is anxiety-provoking,

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.276
and it was already the famous

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:31.869
Danish philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.583
who pointed out that anxiety

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:37.848
is linked to the possibility of possibility.

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:42.281
Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.

00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:45.362
We have endless market analysis,

00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.871
projections of the future earnings.

00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:50.571
Even with market, which is about chance,

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.711
randomness, we think we can predict rationally

00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.434
where it's going.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:07:01.281
Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.171
Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourt

00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:08.446
at the University of Chicago organized an event,

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:11.843
a conference on the idea of chance.

00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:13.929
He and I were together on the panel,

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:16.446
and just before delivering our papers â€”

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.796
we didn't know each other's papers â€”

00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:21.304
we decided to take chance seriously.

00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:23.140
So we informed our audience

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.489
that what they will just now hear

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:27.502
will be a random paper,

00:07:27.502 --> 00:07:29.674
a mixture of the two papers

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:33.545
which we didn't know what each was writing.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:37.725
Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.

00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:39.946
Bernard read his first paragraph,

00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:42.070
I read my first paragraph,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.277
Bernard read his second paragraph,

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:45.762
I read my second paragraph,

00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:49.384
in this way towards the end of our papers.

00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:51.263
Now, you will be surprised

00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:53.445
that a majority of our audience

00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:56.188
did not think that what they'd just listened to

00:07:56.188 --> 00:07:59.473
was a completely random paper.

00:07:59.473 --> 00:08:01.419
They couldn't believe that

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.939
speaking from the position of authority

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.817
like two professors we were,

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.888
we would take chance seriously.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.475
They thought we prepared the papers together

00:08:11.475 --> 00:08:14.953
and were just joking that it's random.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:19.120
Now, we live in times with a lot of information,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.711
big data,

00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.715
a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:25.458
We decoded our genome.

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:28.569
We know about our brains more than before.

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:31.205
But surprisingly, people are more and more

00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:35.640
turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.633
Ignorance and denial are on the rise.

00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:43.851
Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,

00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:46.505
we think that we will just wake up again

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:48.721
and everything will be the same as before,

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:51.984
and no political or social changes are needed.

00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:54.234
In regard to ecological crisis,

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.350
we think nothing needs to be done just now,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.252
or others need to act before us.

00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:03.548
Or even when ecological crisis already happens,

00:09:03.548 --> 00:09:05.877
like a catastrophe in Fukushima,

00:09:05.877 --> 00:09:08.701
often we have people living in the same environment

00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.523
with the same amount of information,

00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:14.210
and half of them will be anxious about radiation

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.531
and half of them will ignore it.

00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:20.343
Now, psychoanalysts know very well

00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:22.818
that people surprisingly don't have

00:09:22.818 --> 00:09:24.607
passion for knowledge

00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:27.689
but passion for ignorance.

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:29.174
Now, what does that mean?

00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:30.990
Let's say when we are facing

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.783
a life-threatening illness,

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:36.989
a lot of people don't want to know that.

00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:40.387
They'd rather prefer denying the illness,

00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:43.661
which is why it's not so wise to inform them

00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:45.370
if they don't ask.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.800
Surprisingly, research shows that sometimes

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.644
people who deny their illness

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:53.560
live longer than those who are rationally choosing

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.999
the best treatment.

00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:58.120
Now, this ignorance, however,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.849
is not very helpful on the level of the social.

00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:06.179
When we are ignorant about where we are heading,

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:10.364
a lot of social damage can be caused.

00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:12.445
Now, on top of facing ignorance,

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.683
we are also facing today

00:10:14.683 --> 00:10:17.844
some kind of an obviousness.

00:10:17.844 --> 00:10:19.971
Now, it was French philosopher

00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:22.080
Louis Althusser who pointed out

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.643
that ideology functions in such a way

00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:28.509
that it creates a veil of obviousness.

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:32.244
Before we do any social critique,

00:10:32.244 --> 00:10:36.631
it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness

00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:39.960
and to think through a little bit differently.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.997
If we go back to this ideology

00:10:41.997 --> 00:10:44.528
of individual, rational choice

00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:46.856
we often embrace,

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:48.836
it's necessary precisely here

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:51.165
to lift this obviousness

00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:54.296
and to think a little bit differently.

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:57.260
Now for me, a question often is

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.863
why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man

00:11:01.863 --> 00:11:05.395
on which capitalism relied from its beginning?

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:07.880
Why do we think that we are really such masters

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.705
of our lives that we can rationally

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:13.157
make the best ideal choices,

00:11:13.157 --> 00:11:16.386
that we don't accept losses and risks?

00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:19.671
And for me, it's very shocking to
see sometimes very poor people,

00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:22.015
for example, not supporting the idea

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.633
of the rich being taxed more.

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:27.681
Quite often here they still identify

00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:30.279
with a certain kind of a lottery mentality.

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.562
Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:34.964
in the future, but maybe they think,

00:11:34.964 --> 00:11:38.153
my son might become the next Bill Gates.

00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:41.370
And who would want to tax one's son?

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.200
Or, a question for me is also,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.580
why would people who have no health insurance

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.561
not embrace universal healthcare?

00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:52.090
Sometimes they don't embrace it,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.914
again identifying with the idea of choice,

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.472
but they have nothing to choose from.

00:11:57.472 --> 00:12:01.922
Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.554
that there is nothing like a society.

00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:08.334
Society doesn't exist, it is only individuals

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:10.130
and their families.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:15.263
Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:17.547
which is why people who are poor might feel

00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:19.470
ashamed for their poverty.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.732
We might endlessly feel guilty that we are

00:12:21.732 --> 00:12:23.846
not making the right choices,

00:12:23.846 --> 00:12:26.142
and that's why we didn't succeed.

00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:29.674
We are anxious that we are not good enough.

00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:31.597
That's why we work very hard,

00:12:31.597 --> 00:12:33.138
long hours at the workplace

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:37.576
and equally long hours on remaking ourselves.

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:39.989
Now, when we are anxious over choices,

00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:44.421
sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.

00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:46.217
We identify with the guru

00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:47.496
who tells us what to do,

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:50.140
self-help therapist,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.919
or we embrace a totalitarian leader

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:55.706
who appears to have no doubts about choices,

00:12:55.706 --> 00:12:57.790
who sort of knows.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.566
Now, often people ask me,

00:13:00.566 --> 00:13:02.940
"What did you learn by studying choice?"

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.111
And there is an important message that I did learn.

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.598
When thinking about choices,

00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:13.558
I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.

00:13:13.558 --> 00:13:16.180
First, I realized a lot of choice I make

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.639
is not rational.

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:19.543
It's linked to my unconscious,

00:13:19.543 --> 00:13:21.737
my guesses of what others are choosing,

00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:25.393
or what is a socially embraced choice.

00:13:25.393 --> 00:13:27.690
I also embrace the idea

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.330
that we should go beyond

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.254
thinking about individual choices,

00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:34.910
that it's very important to rethink social choices,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.611
since this ideology of individual
choice has pacified us.

00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:41.749
It really prevented us to think about social change.

00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:45.480
We spend so much time
choosing things for ourselves

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.250
and barely reflect on

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.476
communal choices we can make.

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:51.176
Now, we should not forget that choice

00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:53.860
is always linked to change.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.676
We can make individual changes,

00:13:55.676 --> 00:13:57.861
but we can make social changes.

00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:01.627
We can choose to have more wolves.

00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:04.394
We can choose to change our environment

00:14:04.394 --> 00:14:06.824
to have more bees.

00:14:06.824 --> 00:14:11.110
We can choose to have different rating agencies.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.573
We can choose to control corporations

00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:17.437
instead of allowing corporations to control us.

00:14:17.437 --> 00:14:20.852
We have a possibility to make changes.

00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:24.130
Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.859
who said that when we make choice in life,

00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:29.446
we shouldn't forget to live.

00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:31.673
Finally, you can see

00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:33.180
I did have a choice

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.467
to choose one of the three quotes

00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:38.491
with which I wanted to start my lecture.

00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:40.390
I did have a choice,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.698
such as nations, as people,

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.970
we have choices too to rethink

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.282
in what kind of society we want to live in the future.

00:14:48.282 --> 00:14:50.333
Thank you.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:54.563
(Applause)
