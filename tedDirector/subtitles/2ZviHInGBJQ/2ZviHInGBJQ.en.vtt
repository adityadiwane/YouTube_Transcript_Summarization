00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.134
It was April, last year.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.461
I was on an evening out with friends

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.238
to celebrate one of their birthdays.

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.070
We hadn't been all together
for a couple of weeks;

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:24.490
it was a perfect evening,
as we were all reunited.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.473
At the end of the evening,

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:30.182
I caught the last underground train
back to the other side of London.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.455
The journey was smooth.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.987
I got back to my local station

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.038
and I began the 10-minute walk home.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.523
As I turned the corner onto my street,

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:41.063
my house in sight up ahead,

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:42.980
I heard footsteps behind me

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.167
that seemed to have
approached out of nowhere

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:46.591
and were picking up pace.

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:50.305
Before I had time to process
what was happening,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.460
a hand was clapped around my mouth
so that I could not breathe,

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:56.184
and the young man behind me
dragged me to the ground,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.334
beat my head repeatedly
against the pavement

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.340
until my face began to bleed,

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:02.572
kicking me in the back and neck

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.248
while he began to assault me,

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.734
ripping off my clothes
and telling me to "shut up,"

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:08.417
as I struggled to cry for help.

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.819
With each smack of my head
to the concrete ground,

00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:14.773
a question echoed through my mind
that still haunts me today:

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:17.327
"Is this going to be how it all ends?"

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.740
Little could I have realized,
I'd been followed the whole way

00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:23.715
from the moment I left the station.

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:24.942
And hours later,

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.510
I was standing topless and barelegged
in front of the police,

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:31.306
having the cuts and bruises
on my naked body photographed

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.852
for forensic evidence.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:37.195
Now, there are few words to describe
the all-consuming feelings

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.424
of vulnerability, shame, upset
and injustice that I was ridden with

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:42.504
in that moment and for the weeks to come.

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:46.492
But wanting to find a way
to condense these feelings

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.838
into something ordered
that I could work through,

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.997
I decided to do what
felt most natural to me:

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.557
I wrote about it.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.582
It started out as a cathartic exercise.

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:58.664
I wrote a letter to my assaulter,

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.783
humanizing him as "you,"

00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:03.684
to identify him as part
of the very community

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:05.856
that he had so violently
abused that night.

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.265
Stressing the tidal-wave
effect of his actions,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.505
I wrote:

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250
"Did you ever think
of the people in your life?

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:16.178
I don't know who the people
in your life are.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.159
I don't know anything about you.

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:19.815
But I do know this:

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.920
you did not just attack me that night.

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:23.836
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.545
I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.871
I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:28.062
I'm a neighbor;

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.135
I'm the employee
who served everyone coffee

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.712
in the cafÃ© under the railway.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:34.848
And all the people who form
these relations to me

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:36.525
make up my community.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.684
And you assaulted
every single one of them.

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.254
You violated the truth that I
will never cease to fight for,

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:44.215
and which all of these people represent:

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.509
that there are infinitely more
good people in the world than bad."

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.789
But, determined not to let
this one incident make me lose faith

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:54.526
in the solidarity in my community
or humanity as a whole,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.028
I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings
in July 2005 on London transport,

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:02.452
and how the mayor of London at the time,
and indeed my own parents,

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:05.323
had insisted that we all get back
on the tubes the next day,

00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:07.110
so we wouldn't be defined or changed

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:09.033
by those that had made us feel unsafe.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.944
I told my attacker,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.289
"You've carried out your attack,

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:15.453
but now I'm getting back on my tube.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.429
My community will not feel we are unsafe
walking home after dark.

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:21.156
We will get on the last tubes home,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.014
and we will walk up our streets alone,

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:25.374
because we will not ingrain
or submit to the idea

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:28.166
that we are putting ourselves
in danger in doing so.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.790
We will continue
to come together, like an army,

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:33.761
when any member
of our community is threatened.

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.895
And this is a fight you will not win."

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:39.428
At the time of writing this letter --

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.827
(Applause)

00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:41.996
Thank you.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020
(Applause)

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:46.437
At the time of writing this letter,

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:48.316
I was studying for my exams in Oxford,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.724
and I was working
on the local student paper there.

00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:54.048
Despite being lucky enough to have
friends and family supporting me,

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:55.280
it was an isolating time.

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:57.791
I didn't know anyone
who'd been through this before;

00:03:57.815 --> 00:03:59.259
at least I didn't think I did.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:02.777
I'd read news reports, statistics,
and knew how common sexual assault was,

00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.858
yet I couldn't actually name
a single person

00:04:04.882 --> 00:04:07.965
that I'd heard speak out
about an experience of this kind before.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.926
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.946
I decided that I would publish
my letter in the student paper,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.878
hoping to reach out to others in Oxford

00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:18.273
that might have had a similar experience
and be feeling the same way.

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:19.523
At the end of the letter,

00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:21.913
I asked others to write in
with their experiences

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:23.629
under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.679
to emphasize that survivors of assault
could express themselves

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.609
without feeling shame or guilt
about what happened to them --

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:32.209
to show that we could all
stand up to sexual assault.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:35.065
What I never anticipated
is that almost overnight,

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:37.007
this published letter would go viral.

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:40.145
Soon, we were receiving
hundreds of stories

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.952
from men and women across the world,

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:44.648
which we began to publish
on a website I set up.

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:46.730
And the hashtag became a campaign.

00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:51.342
There was an Australian mother in her 40s
who described how on an evening out,

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:52.922
she was followed to the bathroom

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.272
by a man who went
to repeatedly grab her crotch.

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:56.918
There was a man in the Netherlands

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:59.634
who described how he was date-raped
on a visit to London

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:02.540
and wasn't taken seriously
by anyone he reported his case to.

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:05.998
I had personal Facebook messages
from people in India and South America,

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:09.133
saying, how can we bring
the message of the campaign there?

00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:11.971
One of the first contributions we had
was from a woman called Nikki,

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:14.812
who described growing up,
being molested my her own father.

00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:16.319
And I had friends open up to me

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:19.436
about experiences ranging
from those that happened last week

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.587
to those that happened years ago,
that I'd had no idea about.

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:25.685
And the more we started
to receive these messages,

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.293
the more we also started
to receive messages of hope --

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:30.792
people feeling empowered
by this community of voices

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.320
standing up to sexual assault
and victim-blaming.

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:34.643
One woman called Olivia,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.452
after describing how she was attacked

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:39.302
by someone she had trusted
and cared about for a long time,

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.724
said, "I've read many
of the stories posted here,

00:05:41.748 --> 00:05:44.738
and I feel hopeful that if so many
women can move forward,

00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:45.944
then I can, too.

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:47.275
I've been inspired by many,

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:49.492
and I hope I can be as strong
as them someday.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.670
I'm sure I will."

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:53.808
People around the world began
tweeting under this hashtag,

00:05:53.832 --> 00:05:56.909
and the letter was republished
and covered by the national press,

00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:00.229
as well as being translated into several
other languages worldwide.

00:06:00.642 --> 00:06:03.016
But something struck me
about the media attention

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.651
that this letter was attracting.

00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:06.753
For something to be front-page news,

00:06:06.777 --> 00:06:09.744
given the word "news" itself,

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:13.148
we can assume it must be something new
or something surprising.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.398
And yet sexual assault
is not something new.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.731
Sexual assault, along with other
kinds of injustices,

00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:20.643
is reported in the media all the time.

00:06:21.154 --> 00:06:22.352
But through the campaign,

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:24.983
these injustices were framed
as not just news stories,

00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:28.325
they were firsthand experiences
that had affected real people,

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.699
who were creating,
with the solidarity of others,

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.814
what they needed
and had previously lacked:

00:06:32.838 --> 00:06:34.235
a platform to speak out,

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.711
the reassurance they weren't alone
or to blame for what happened to them

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:41.364
and open discussions that would help
to reduce stigma around the issue.

00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:45.056
The voices of those directly affected
were at the forefront of the story --

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.306
not the voices of journalists
or commentators on social media.

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:51.116
And that's why the story was news.

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:54.346
We live in an incredibly
interconnected world

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.270
with the proliferation of social media,

00:06:56.294 --> 00:06:59.927
which is of course a fantastic resource
for igniting social change.

00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:02.678
But it's also made us
increasingly reactive,

00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:06.089
from the smallest annoyances
of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.484
to the greatest injustices of war,
genocides, terrorist attacks.

00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:14.006
Our default response has become
to leap to react to any kind of grievance

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.178
by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.854
anything to show others
that we, too, have reacted.

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:22.111
The problem with reacting
in this manner en masse

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:25.056
is it can sometimes mean
that we don't actually react at all,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.529
not in the sense of actually
doing anything, anyway.

00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:29.291
It might make ourselves feel better,

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.866
like we've contributed
to a group mourning or outrage,

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.852
but it doesn't actually change anything.

00:07:33.876 --> 00:07:35.040
And what's more,

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:36.868
it can sometimes drown out the voices

00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.990
of those directly
affected by the injustice,

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:40.593
whose needs must be heard.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.633
Worrying, too, is the tendency
for some reactions to injustice

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.254
to build even more walls,

00:07:47.278 --> 00:07:50.640
being quick to point fingers
with the hope of providing easy solutions

00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:51.857
to complex problems.

00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:54.867
One British tabloid,
on the publication of my letter,

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.420
branded a headline stating,

00:07:56.444 --> 00:08:00.101
"Oxford Student Launches
Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."

00:08:01.567 --> 00:08:03.834
But the campaign never
meant to shame anyone.

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:07.384
It meant to let people speak
and to make others listen.

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:11.600
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick
to create even more injustice,

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.574
commenting on
my attacker's ethnicity or class

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:16.835
to push their own prejudiced agendas.

00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:20.842
And some even accused me
of feigning the whole thing

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:22.972
to push, and I quote,

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:26.810
my "feminist agenda of man-hating."

00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:27.896
(Laughter)

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.080
I know, right?

00:08:29.104 --> 00:08:31.969
As if I'm going to be like,
"Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,

00:08:31.993 --> 00:08:34.358
I'm busy trying to hate
the entire male population

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:35.767
by the time I'm 30."

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:36.929
(Laughter)

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:39.001
Now, I'm almost sure

00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:41.997
that these people wouldn't say
the things they say in person.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.783
But it's as if because they might
be behind a screen,

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:46.366
in the comfort in their own home

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.541
when on social media,

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:50.219
people forget that what
they're doing is a public act --

00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:53.019
that other people will be reading it
and be affected by it.

00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:55.772
Returning to my analogy
of getting back on our trains,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.473
another main concern I have
about this noise that escalates

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.373
from our online responses to injustice

00:09:01.397 --> 00:09:04.872
is that it can very easily slip
into portraying us as the affected party,

00:09:04.896 --> 00:09:06.916
which can lead to a sense of defeatism,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.659
a kind of mental barrier to seeing
any opportunity for positivity or change

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.258
after a negative situation.

00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:15.327
A couple of months
before the campaign started

00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:16.792
or any of this happened to me,

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:18.562
I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,

00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:20.521
and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:22.806
the former private secretary
to Nelson Mandela.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.975
One of the stories
she told really struck me.

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:27.824
She spoke of when
Mandela was taken to court

00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:29.438
by the South African Rugby Union

00:09:29.462 --> 00:09:32.013
after he commissioned
an inquiry into sports affairs.

00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:33.188
In the courtroom,

00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:36.203
he went up to the South African
Rugby Union's lawyers,

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.387
shook them by the hand

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.854
and conversed with them,
each in their own language.

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:41.218
And Zelda wanted to protest,

00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:43.149
saying they had no right to his respect

00:09:43.173 --> 00:09:45.448
after this injustice they had caused him.

00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:47.549
He turned to her and said,

00:09:48.324 --> 00:09:52.453
"You must never allow the enemy
to determine the grounds for battle."

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.610
At the time of hearing these words,

00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:57.902
I didn't really know why
they were so important,

00:09:57.926 --> 00:10:01.287
but I felt they were, and I wrote them
down in a notebook I had on me.

00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:03.808
But I've thought about this line
a lot ever since.

00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:06.715
Revenge, or the expression of hatred

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:08.675
towards those who have done us injustice

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:11.713
may feel like a human instinct
in the face of wrong,

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.651
but we need to break out of these cycles

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:16.783
if we are to hope to transform
negative events of injustice

00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:18.510
into positive social change.

00:10:18.906 --> 00:10:20.079
To do otherwise

00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:23.382
continues to let the enemy
determine the grounds for battle,

00:10:23.406 --> 00:10:24.592
creates a binary,

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:27.120
where we who have suffered
become the affected,

00:10:27.144 --> 00:10:29.524
pitted against them, the perpetrators.

00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:32.013
And just like we got back on our tubes,

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:35.073
we can't let our platforms
for interconnectivity and community

00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:37.169
be the places that we settle for defeat.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:42.588
But I don't want to discourage
a social media response,

00:10:42.612 --> 00:10:45.279
because I owe the development
of the #NotGuilty campaign

00:10:45.303 --> 00:10:46.847
almost entirely to social media.

00:10:46.871 --> 00:10:49.396
But I do want to encourage
a more considered approach

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.543
to the way we use it
to respond to injustice.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.018
The start, I think,
is to ask ourselves two things.

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:56.574
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?

00:10:56.598 --> 00:10:58.904
In my case, there were
several answers to this.

00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:01.161
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,

00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:04.085
under the assumption they
wouldn't have to be held to account

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:06.022
or recognize the damage they had caused.

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:08.954
Not only that, but thousands
of men and women suffer every day

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:10.696
from sexual abuse, often in silence,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.272
yet it's still a problem we don't give
the same airtime to as other issues.

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:16.816
It's still an issue many people
blame victims for.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.122
Next, ask yourself: How,
in recognizing these reasons,

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.822
could I go about reversing them?

00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:25.771
With us, this was holding my attacker
to account -- and many others.

00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:28.401
It was calling them out
on the effect they had caused.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.159
It was giving airtime
to the issue of sexual assault,

00:11:31.183 --> 00:11:34.544
opening up discussions amongst friends,
amongst families, in the media

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.209
that had been closed for too long,

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:38.590
and stressing that victims
shouldn't feel to blame

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:39.885
for what happened to them.

00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:43.227
We might still have a long way to go
in solving this problem entirely.

00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:44.402
But in this way,

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:47.737
we can begin to use social media
as an active tool for social justice,

00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:49.859
as a tool to educate,
to stimulate dialogues,

00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:52.568
to make those in positions
of authority aware of an issue

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:55.113
by listening to those
directly affected by it.

00:11:56.112 --> 00:12:00.582
Because sometimes these questions
don't have easy answers.

00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:02.272
In fact, they rarely do.

00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:05.979
But this doesn't mean we still
can't give them a considered response.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.574
In situations where
you can't go about thinking

00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:10.693
how you'd reverse
this feeling of injustice,

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:13.371
you can still think,
maybe not what you can do,

00:12:13.395 --> 00:12:14.944
but what you can not do.

00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:19.373
You can not build further walls
by fighting injustice with more prejudice,

00:12:19.397 --> 00:12:20.559
more hatred.

00:12:20.894 --> 00:12:24.736
You can not speak over those
directly affected by an injustice.

00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:29.100
And you can not react to injustice,
only to forget about it the next day,

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.432
just because the rest
of Twitter has moved on.

00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:36.265
Sometimes not reacting
instantly is, ironically,

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:38.683
the best immediate course
of action we can take.

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:43.729
Because we might be angry, upset
and energized by injustice,

00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:46.522
but let's consider our responses.

00:12:47.413 --> 00:12:50.649
Let us hold people to account,
without descending into a culture

00:12:50.673 --> 00:12:53.459
that thrives off shaming
and injustice ourselves.

00:12:54.345 --> 00:12:55.992
Let us remember that distinction,

00:12:56.016 --> 00:12:58.214
so often forgotten by internet users,

00:12:58.238 --> 00:13:00.678
between criticism and insult.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.346
Let us not forget
to think before we speak,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.787
just because we might
have a screen in front of us.

00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:07.782
And when we create noise on social media,

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:10.124
let it not drown out the needs
of those affected,

00:13:10.148 --> 00:13:12.589
but instead let it amplify their voices,

00:13:12.613 --> 00:13:15.555
so the internet becomes a place
where you're not the exception

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:18.747
if you speak out about something
that has actually happened to you.

00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:20.824
All these considered
approaches to injustice

00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:23.544
evoke the very keystones
on which the internet was built:

00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:26.572
to network, to have signal, to connect --

00:13:26.596 --> 00:13:29.088
all these terms that imply
bringing people together,

00:13:29.112 --> 00:13:30.335
not pushing people apart.

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:35.165
Because if you look up the word
"justice" in the dictionary,

00:13:35.977 --> 00:13:37.243
before punishment,

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:40.543
before administration of law
or judicial authority,

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:42.775
you get:

00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:44.911
"The maintenance of what is right."

00:13:45.794 --> 00:13:49.560
And I think there are few things
more "right" in this world

00:13:49.584 --> 00:13:51.320
than bringing people together,

00:13:51.344 --> 00:13:52.646
than unions.

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:55.892
And if we allow social media
to deliver that,

00:13:55.916 --> 00:13:59.854
then it can deliver a very powerful
form of justice, indeed.

00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:01.706
Thank you very much.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:08.615
(Applause)
