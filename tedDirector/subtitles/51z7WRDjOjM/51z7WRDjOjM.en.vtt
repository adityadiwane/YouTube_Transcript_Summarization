00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
being here over these past few days.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
this extraordinary gathering of people,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
these amazing talks that we've had.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to some of the things that I've heard.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I came directly here

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with indigenous people with paint on their faces

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and parrot feathers on their headdresses,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and keep the roads, out of their forests.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a world that isn't polluted.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with what we're all talking about here at TED,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and that was mainly to bring water up by pump

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so that the women wouldn't have to go down.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they were able to store a lot of electricity.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in this little community -- could have light

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We want to know about health care.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And we want to learn other languages.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and we're good at languages."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So there he is with his little laptop computer,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but fighting against the might of the pressures --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And so, coming directly from there to here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But, of course, my real field of expertise

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
lies in an even different kind of civilization --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I can't really call it a civilization.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
A different way of life, a different being.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
about the different cultures of the humans around the world --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but the world is not composed only of human beings;

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there are also other animal beings.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I propose to bring into this TED conference,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but these beings have voices that mean something.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And so, I want to give you a greeting,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Applause)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
During that time, there have been modern technologies

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that have really transformed the way

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that field biologists do their work.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
For example, for the first time, a few years ago,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
by simply collecting little fecal samples

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
are the fathers of each individual infant.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to determine the range of the chimps.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but we're using satellite imagery

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to look at the deforestation in the area.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And of course, there's developments in infrared,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
so you can watch animals at night,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and equipment for recording by video,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and tape recording is getting lighter and better.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So in many, many ways, we can do things today

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with large brains, are studied in captivity,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
modern technology is helping us to search

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So that we know today, they're capable of performances

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that would have been thought absolutely impossible

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
by science when I began.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
her name means love --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
She loves her computer --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
she'll leave her big group, and her running water,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and her trees and everything.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And she'll come in to sit at this computer --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but the amazing thing about this female is

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
she doesn't like making mistakes.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
because she can't see the experimenter --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
which is asking to have another go.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
just for the satisfaction of having done it better.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
like one raisin for a correct response --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the first time, when I was going through the vegetation,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
although some were a little bit acclimatized --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and I peered with my binoculars.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
he was picking little pieces of grass and using them

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to fish termites from their underground nest.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and strip the leaves --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the beginning of tool-making.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is at that time, it was thought that humans,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and only humans, used and made tools.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
or accept chimpanzees as humans."

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
(Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
wherever chimps have been studied,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
there are completely different tool-using behaviors.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And because it seems that these patterns are passed

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
from one generation to the next, through observation,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
What we find is that over these 40-odd years

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that I and others have been studying chimpanzees

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
with complex brains and social systems,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It's a very wuzzy line.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but they have this long childhood, five years

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of suckling and sleeping with the mother,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and then another three, four or five years

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
with the brothers and sisters,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and which can last through a lifetime,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
which may be up to 60 years.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
but they also use touch, posture, gesture,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and what do they do?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the kind of things that we do,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and they do them in the same kind of context.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
They have very sophisticated cooperation.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and they share the prey.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They know mental as well as physical suffering.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And I don't have time to go into the information

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that will prove some of these things to you,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other."

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Once we're prepared to admit that after all,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
we're not the only beings with personalities, minds

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and above all feelings, and then we start to think

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
about ways we use and abuse

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
are in the wild, disappearing very fast.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
They're disappearing for the reasons

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that all of you in this room know only too well.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
They're disappearing because some timber companies

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
go in with clear-cutting.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
as they want to do in Ecuador

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and other parts where the forests remain untouched --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
to take out oil or timber.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to what is known as the bush-meat trade.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
for themselves and their families --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
now, suddenly, because of the roads,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the hunters can go in from the towns.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
who've lived there with their wonderful way of living

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Their culture is being destroyed,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
along with the animals upon whom they depend.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and what do we see in Africa?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We see deforestation;

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
we see disease and we see population growth in areas

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
where there are more people living on a certain piece of land

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
than the land can possibly support,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Were the people that we heard about yesterday,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Didn't they know what was happening?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in some of these parts of the world

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
"How am I going to feed my family today?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
which will keep us going a little bit longer,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and then we'll pray that something will happen

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
to save us from the inevitable end."

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So, this is a pretty grim picture.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The one thing we have, which makes us so different

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
from chimpanzees or other living creatures,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
is this sophisticated spoken language --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
a language with which we can tell children

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
about things that aren't here.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
discuss ideas with each other,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We can do it by talking to each other;

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and we're destroying the world.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
because we have so much access to knowledge

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
of the stupidity of what we're doing.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Do you know, we're bringing little babies

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
from the contaminated land is poisoning them.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And so many of these diseases, like asthma

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
We're harming ourselves around the world,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Mother Nature, that brought us into being;

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
where there's trees and flowers and birds

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
for our good psychological development.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
in the developed world who never see nature,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
because they're growing up in concrete

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and all they know is virtual reality,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
coming down from the canopy above.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
As I was traveling around the world, you know,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
for my students and field staff to continue studying

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
because, finding they dwindled from about two million

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
100 years ago to about 150,000 now,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
to raise awareness around the world.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and the problems of the developing world

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
so often stem from the greed of the developed world,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
How can we do it?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Somebody said that yesterday.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
They were feeling despair,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And then I met some who were angry,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and anger that can turn to violence,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and we're all familiar with that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And I have three little grandchildren,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
and when some of these students would say to me

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,"

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
or "We're filled with despair, because we feel

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
There's little brochures all around outside,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I beg that you pick up that brochure.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Roots make a firm foundation.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Shoots seem tiny,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
See the brick walls as all the problems

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
that we've inflicted on this planet.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Then, you see, it is a message of hope.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
can break through, and can make this a better world.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
is that every single individual makes a difference.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Every individual has a role to play.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
and you scientists know that you can't actually --

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and things like that --

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
you're making a difference in the world.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
So, the Roots and Shoots program

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
involves youth in three kinds of projects.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I learned everything I know about animal behavior

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
who was my childhood companion.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
and we go now from pre-school right through university.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
are different from the problems in New York.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
It's going to depend on which country they're in --

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and spreading it themselves.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Why?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Because they're buying into it,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
It isn't something that their parents tell them,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
or their teachers tell them.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
That's effective, but if they decide themselves,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
"We want to clean this river

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
and put the fish back that used to be there.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
We want to clear away the toxic soil

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
from this area and have an organic garden.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
We want to go and spend time with the old people

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
and hear their stories and record their oral histories.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
We want to go and work in a dog shelter.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
We want to learn about animals. We want ... "

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
As I travel around the world 300 days a year,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
"Look at the difference we've made."

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And now comes the technology into it,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
because with this new way of communicating electronically

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
these kids can communicate with each other around the world.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
The philosophy is very simple.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
We do not believe in violence.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
No violence, no bombs, no guns.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That's not the way to solve problems.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
So how do we solve?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Hard work and persistence --don't give up --

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
How many more minutes? Two, one?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
(Laughter)

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Are you going to come and drag me off?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
(Laughter)

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
is beginning to change young people's lives.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
not just because you can share technology with us,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
but because so many of you have children.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And if you take this program out, and give it to your children,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
because they've got parents like you.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And it's been so clear how much you all care

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
about trying to make this world a better place.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
It's very encouraging.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
But the kids do ask me --

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening."

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now that we know what the problems are around the world,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And we've talked a lot about that.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Secondly, the resilience of nature.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
We can destroy a river,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
and we can bring it back to life.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
We can see a whole area desolated,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
talked about the indomitable human spirit.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
We are surrounded by the most amazing people

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
so much love and so much compassion.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the fear that was leading to people feeling

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
they couldn't worry about the environment any more,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
in case they seemed not to be patriotic --

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and I was trying to encourage them,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
"If you look back through human history,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and I want to end on this note.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
from the killing fields of Pol Pot --

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
one of the most evil regimes in human history --

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
where people are now beginning to put their lives back together

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
after the regime has crumbled.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Is it out there with the politicians?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It's in our hands.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It's in your hands and my hands

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
and those of our children.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
It's really up to us.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We're the ones who can make a difference.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
If we lead lives where we consciously leave

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
the lightest possible ecological footprints,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
and don't buy the things that are not,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
we can change the world overnight.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Thank you.
