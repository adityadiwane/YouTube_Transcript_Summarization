00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and, of course, with technology it never is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with such an incredible last half a dozen years,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and what we're supposed to expect about the future

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
depends on how we bucket things

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and how we categorize them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from some of the other things you might pick.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For one thing, both were very real.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
worth of gold out of California. It was very real.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
communicate with each other. It's a big deal.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I don't have to remind you of all the hype

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Some have 5,000. Many have more.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
"The Eldorado of the United States of America:

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So many people left what they were doing.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
they thought, "Ah, this isn't real."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But they keep hearing about people getting rich,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
by not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
These are community affairs, by the way.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and they would form companies.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and then take another ship north.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a surgeon in the other.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to go search for gold.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And you saw some of the excesses

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Half of them deserted to go look for gold.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because they were afraid they wouldn't come back.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"The struggle between right and six dollars a month

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
They loaded up their mules and their horses.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And they didn't plan right.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
before they could get where they were going.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
account for the myriads of ravens along the road.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
(Laughter)

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But they spent three and a half million dollars

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and I think rather severely.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
at the present time who feel keenly disappointed.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
have reached the coveted goal only to discover

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the fact that there is nothing here for them."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And that was, of course, the very common story.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Because when you take out that last piece of gold --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the entire American river region, within two years --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
who used more sophisticated mining technologies

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
started to take gold out of there.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and that analogy is the electric industry.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
With the electric industry you actually have to --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
one of them is that they're both sort of thin,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It's not a specific thing.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It's an incredible means of coordinating,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in a very fine-grained way, information flows.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is sort of the golden age of appliances.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So the light bulb is what wired the world.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
They were really thinking about --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
they weren't putting electricity into the home;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
they were putting lighting into the home.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
All the streets had to be torn up.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And they're tearing up all the streets.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
which became General Electric,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Because, remember, the Web got to stand

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
on top of all this heavy infrastructure

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
when people weren't really investing in the Web?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and then home appliances started coming into being.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
this was the 1890 electric fan.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
it depends how you want to measure it --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
The electric iron, also very big.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
(Laughter)

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
There's asbestos under that handle there.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So it wasn't a big seller.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This was truly, truly an early-adopter product --

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
(Laughter)

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, not all these things were highly successful.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
These never really caught on either:

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
This came in, like, six different colors.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
(Laughter)

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I don't know why. But I thought, you know,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
maybe it's time to give this one another shot.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
(Laughter)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Now, the toaster was huge

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
because they used to make toast on open fires,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and it took a lot of time and attention.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And you'd plug it in there.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
if you wanted to plug in an appliance.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And it would clean your clothes.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And this was a big deal.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And you'd run a long cord into the house

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
where you could screw it into your light socket.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(Laughter)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
because they hadn't invented the off switch.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
because it didn't make any sense.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And there are --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And they couldn't yank the cord out

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
(Laughter)

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to be plugging things into a light socket like this.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is a total kludge, if you ask me.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
(Laughter)

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
This is what it looks like under my desk.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I took this picture just two days ago.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
(Laughter)

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It's a total, total mess.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And, you know, we think it's getting better,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
(Laughter)

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I challenge you to try. It's very hard.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Try to get DSL installed in your house.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The engineers who do it everyday can't do it.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They have to -- typically, they come three times.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And one friend of mine was telling me a story:

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
not only did they get there and have to wait,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
for the third time, they had to call somebody.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
because then they had to wait on hold for an hour

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to talk to somebody to give them an access code

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
after they got there.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
By the way, DSL is a kludge.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
for the purpose it's being put to --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
you know it's the whole thing --

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
then you'd be pretty depressed right now

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
because the last nugget of gold would be gone.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We're in 1908.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb."

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
My mom hates this picture.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
(Laughter)

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
than there is behind us.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
It says: "Use your electricity for more than light."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And I think that's where we are.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
We're very, very early. Thank you very much.
