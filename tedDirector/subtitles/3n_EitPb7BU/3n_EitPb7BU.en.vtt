00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Four years ago, on the TED stage,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.728
I announced a company I was working with at the time

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:25.637
called Odeo.

00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:27.314
And because of that announcement,

00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:29.376
we got a big article in The New York Times,

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:32.653
which led to more press, which led to more attention,

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:35.330
and me deciding to become CEO of that company --

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
whereas I was just an adviser --

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.683
and raising a round of venture capital

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:41.330
and ramping up hiring.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.176
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:49.114
and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:53.776
Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:57.330
that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.576
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:01.422
so we kind of put two and two together,

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:06.375
and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.853
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.206
at a startup, where focus is so critical,

00:01:11.206 --> 00:01:13.545
but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:14.868
to my previous company,

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:17.330
thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.930
and it ended up taking over not only the company,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.330
but my life for the next five or six years.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.667
So I learned to follow hunches

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.530
even though you can't necessarily justify them

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.959
or know where they're going to go.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.330
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
So, for those of you unfamiliar,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.791
Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.006
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.330
and people who are interested in you get those updates.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.776
If they're really interested,

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.914
they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.

00:01:47.914 --> 00:01:50.330
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.374
that I'm giving a talk at TED.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:55.114
And in my case, when I hit send,

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:59.380
up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.752
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter

00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:05.191
lets people share moments of their lives

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.406
whenever they want,

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:08.714
be they momentous occasions

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:12.252
or mundane ones.

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:15.082
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:18.856
that lets people feel more connected and in touch,

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:21.036
despite distance, and in real time.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:24.008
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.367
and what got us excited.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.852
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses

00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:32.933
that would evolve from this very simple system.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.930
One of the things we realized

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.212
was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:41.509
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.420
in October of 2007,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.625
people turned to Twitter to report what was happening

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.659
and to find information from neighbors

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.431
about what was happening around them.

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.736
But it wasn't just individuals.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:54.319
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.336
and put a Twitter feed on the front page,

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.424
and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross

00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:01.520
used it to dispense news and updates as well.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.583
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:07.246
and thousands of people around the world are following along

00:03:07.246 --> 00:03:09.228
because they want to know what it feels like to be here

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:10.804
and what's happening.

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:13.884
Among the other interesting things that have cropped up

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:15.933
are many things from businesses,

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:18.575
from marketing and communications and predictable things,

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:21.812
to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:24.068
that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:29.084
causing a line to form around the block.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.130
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.220
In fact, there are 47 members of Congress

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.971
who currently have Twitter accounts.

00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:38.401
And they're tweeting, in some cases,

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.875
from behind closed-door sessions with the President.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.473
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.996
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:50.883
although his tweets have dropped off as of late,

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:55.674
while Senator McCain's have picked up.

00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:58.858
As have this guy's.

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:02.723
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:04.755
you send one message and it goes out to everybody,

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.811
and you receive the messages you're interested in.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:11.131
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:14.812
was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person

00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:17.118
or a specific message.

00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:20.287
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:21.991
to reply to one of his fans,

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:23.831
was completely invented by users,

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.864
and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular

00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:28.831
and then we made it easier.

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.662
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:33.431
Another is via the API.

00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:35.335
We built an application-programming interface,

00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:39.652
which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:42.335
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:43.687
that can send Twitter updates --

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:48.175
interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.567
as well as things like

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.967
a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks

00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:56.070
or a plant Twitter when it needs water.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.695
Probably the most important third-party development

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:01.455
came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.726
Summize built a Twitter search engine.

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:05.536
And they tapped into the fact

00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:07.743
that, if you have millions of people around the world

00:05:07.743 --> 00:05:10.151
talking about what they're doing and what's around them,

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:14.978
you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:16.623
while it's going on.

00:05:16.623 --> 00:05:18.963
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:23.143
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:26.432
This is another way that our mind was shifted,

00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:28.792
and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:31.209
We liked this so much we actually bought the company

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.640
and are folding it into the main product.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.024
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:39.464
but it introduces new use cases as well.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.176
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:44.723
when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:46.463
Some users figured out

00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:49.476
that they would Twitter when they found gas --

00:05:49.476 --> 00:05:51.752
where it was, and how much it cost --

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:54.266
and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:57.944
which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.

00:05:57.944 --> 00:06:00.273
And this trend of people using this communication network

00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:01.649
to help each other out

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:05.492
goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.

00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:08.659
It's happened more and more lately,

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.145
whether it's raising money for homeless people

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:12.881
or to dig wells in Africa

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.145
or for a family in crisis.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:17.969
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.421
in a matter of days on several occasions.

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:27.498
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:30.066
more good things happen.

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:34.298
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.

00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:36.362
I've learned to follow the hunch,

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.506
but never assume where it will go.

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:41.690
Thanks.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.575
(Applause)

00:06:47.575 --> 00:06:49.346
Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:51.684
So, look, if we could have this screen live.

00:06:51.684 --> 00:06:54.052
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:55.714
after they've been to an event.

00:06:55.714 --> 00:06:58.690
It's totally intimidating.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.810
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.545
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.

00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:10.945
For example: "Evan Williams."

00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:15.253
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."

00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:18.330
"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.144
Oh.

00:07:19.144 --> 00:07:21.052
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:24.190
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.744
Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.

00:07:25.744 --> 00:07:28.114
CA: Just kidding.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.868
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.221
there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.

00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:35.822
So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:38.082
the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:39.467
the fact that it came out of TED.

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:42.421
I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.

00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:44.698
You have build something very fascinating,

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:47.021
and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:48.729
So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:55.330
CA: That was very interesting.
