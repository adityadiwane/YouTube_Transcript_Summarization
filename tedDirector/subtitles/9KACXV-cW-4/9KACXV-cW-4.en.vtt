00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.416
Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start
by just telling us about your country.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.296
It's three dots there on the globe.
Those dots are pretty huge.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.976
I think each one
is about the size of California.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.856
Tell us about Kiribati.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.376
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin
by saying how deeply grateful I am

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.536
for this opportunity to share my story
with people who do care.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.136
I think I've been sharing my story with
a lot of people who don't care too much.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.016
But Kiribati is comprised
of three groups of islands:

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.856
the Gilbert Group on the west,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.216
we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.656
and the Line Islands in the east.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.776
And quite frankly, Kiribati
is perhaps the only country

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.141
that is actually
in the four corners of the world,

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.465
because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,
in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.545
and also in the east and the west
of the International Date Line.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.896
These islands are entirely
made up of coral atolls,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.855
and on average about
two meters above sea level.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.336
And so this is what we have.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.176
Usually not more
than two kilometers in width.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.136
And so, on many occasions,
I've been asked by people,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.696
"You know, you're suffering,
why don't you move back?"

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.936
They don't understand.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.656
They have no concept
of what it is that's involved.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.256
With the rising sea, they say,
"Well, you can move back."

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.856
And so this is what I tell them.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.216
If we move back, we will fall off
on the other side of the ocean. OK?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.016
But these are the kinds of issues
that people don't understand.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.256
CA: So certainly this is
just a picture of fragility there.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.816
When was it that you yourself realized

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.456
that there might be
impending peril for your country?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.936
AT: Well, the story of climate change
has been one that has been going on

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.416
for quite a number of decades.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.176
And when I came into office in 2003,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.456
I began talking about climate change
at the United Nations General Assembly,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.216
but not with so much passion,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.856
because then there was still
this controversy among the scientists

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.136
whether it was human-induced,
whether it was real or it wasn't.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.296
But I think that that debate
was fairly much concluded in 2007

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.896
with the Fourth Assessment
Report of the IPCC,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.776
which made a categorical statement
that it is real, it's human-induced,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.736
and it's predicting
some very serious scenarios

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.296
for countries like mine.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.576
And so that's when I got very serious.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.576
In the past, I talked about it.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.816
We were worried.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.576
But when the scenarios,
the predictions came in 2007,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.936
it became a real issue for us.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.576
CA: Now, those predictions are,
I think, that by 2100,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.376
sea levels are forecast to rise
perhaps three feet.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.020
There's scenarios where
it's higher than that, for sure,

00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:19.180
but what would you say
to a skeptic who said,

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:20.376
"What's three feet?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.576
You're on average
six feet above sea level.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.176
What's the problem?"

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.256
AT: Well, I think
it's got to be understood

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.336
that a marginal rise in sea level

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.936
would mean a loss of a lot of land,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.216
because much of the land is low.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.336
And quite apart from that,
we are getting the swells at the moment.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.536
So it's not about getting two feet.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.576
I think what many people do not understand

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.776
is they think climate change is something
that is happening in the future.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.616
Well, we're at the very
bottom end of the spectrum.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.896
It's already with us.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.736
We have communities
who already have been dislocated.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.696
They have had to move,
and every parliament session,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.056
I'm getting complaints
from different communities

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.136
asking for assistance to build seawalls,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.696
to see what we can do
about the freshwater lens

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.536
because it's being destroyed,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.296
and so in my trips
to the different islands,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.016
I'm seeing evidence of communities

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.656
which are now having to cope
with the loss of food crops,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.256
the contamination of the water lenses,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.616
and I see these communities
perhaps leaving, having to relocate,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.976
within five to 10 years.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.936
CA: And then, I think the country
suffered its first cyclone,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.496
and this is connected, yes?
What happened here?

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.216
AT: Well, we're on the equator,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.656
and I'm sure many of you understand
that when you're on the equator,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.256
it's supposed to be in the doldrums.
We're not supposed to get the cyclones.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.090
We create them, and then we send them
either north or south.

00:04:53.114 --> 00:04:54.496
(Laughter)

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.376
But they aren't supposed to come back.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.924
But for the first time,
at the beginning of this year,

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:02.616
the Cyclone Pam,
which destroyed Vanuatu,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.096
and in the process,
the very edges of it actually touched

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.496
our two southernmost islands,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.896
and all of Tuvalu was underwater
when Hurricane Pam struck.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.616
But for our two southernmost islands,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.976
we had waves come over half the island,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.456
and so this has never happened before.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.056
It's a new experience.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.416
And I've just come back
from my own constituency,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.776
and I've seen these beautiful trees
which had been there for decades,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.776
they've been totally destroyed.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.496
So this is what's happening,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.376
but when we talk
about the rising sea level,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.496
we think it's something
that happens gradually.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.576
It comes with the winds,
it comes with the swells,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.536
and so they can be magnified,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.736
but what we are beginning to witness
is the change in the weather pattern,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.496
which is perhaps the more urgent challenge

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.056
that we will face sooner
than perhaps the rising sea level.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.336
CA: So the country
is already seeing effects now.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.536
As you look forward,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.496
what are your options
as a country, as a nation?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.176
AT: Well, I've been telling
this story every year.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.629
I think I visit a number of --

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:21.616
I've been traveling the world
to try and get people to understand.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.096
We have a plan, we think we have a plan.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.536
And on one occasion,
I think I spoke in Geneva

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.736
and there was a gentleman
who was interviewing me

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.496
on something like this,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.856
and I said, "We are looking
at floating islands,"

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.096
and he thought it was funny,
but somebody said,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.056
"No, this is not funny.
These people are looking for solutions."

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.616
And so I have been looking
at floating islands.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.376
The Japanese are interested
in building floating islands.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.336
But, as a country,
we have made a commitment

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.056
that no matter what happens,
we will try as much as possible

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.256
to stay and continue to exist as a nation.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.816
What that will take,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.256
it's going to be
something quite significant,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.296
very, very substantial.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.096
Either we live on floating islands,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.096
or we have to build up the islands
to continue to stay out of the water

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.856
as the sea level rises
and as the storms get more severe.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.309
But even that, it's going to be
very, very difficult

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:23.176
to get the kind of resourcing
that we would need.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.056
CA: And then the only recourse
is some form of forced migration.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.296
AT: Well, we are also looking at that

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.216
because in the event
that nothing comes forward

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.056
from the international community,

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.336
we are preparing,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.576
we don't want to be caught
like what's happening in Europe.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.296
OK? We don't want to mass migrate
at some point in time.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.736
We want to be able
to give the people the choice today,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.416
those who choose
and want to do that, to migrate.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.496
We don't want something to happen
that they are forced to migrate

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.816
without having been prepared to do so.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.336
Of course, our culture is very different,
our society is very different,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.696
and once we migrate
into a different environment,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.936
a different culture,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.896
there's a whole lot
of adjustments that are required.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.176
CA: Well, there's forced migration
in your country's past,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.856
and I think just this week,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.136
just yesterday
or the day before yesterday,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.336
you visited these people.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.536
What happened here? What's the story here?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.976
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry,
I think somebody was asking

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.976
why we were sneaking off
to visit that place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.976
I had a very good reason, because we have
a community of Kiribati people

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.096
living in that part
of the Solomon Islands,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.976
but these were people who were relocated
from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.456
in the 1960s.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.016
There was serious drought, and the people
could not continue to live on the island,

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.416
and so they were moved
to live here in the Solomon Islands.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.616
And so yesterday it was very interesting
to meet with these people.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.096
They didn't know who I was.
They hadn't heard of me.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.696
Some of them later recognized me,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.296
but I think they were very happy.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.736
Later they really wanted to have
the opportunity to welcome me formally.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.016
But I think what I saw yesterday
was very interesting

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.856
because here I see our people.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.696
I spoke in our language, and of course
they spoke back, they replied,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.416
but their accent, they are beginning
not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.936
I saw them, there was
this lady with red teeth.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.176
She was chewing betel nuts,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.456
and it's not something we do in Kiribati.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.096
We don't chew betel nuts.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.976
I met also a family who have married
the local people here,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.096
and so this is what is happening.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.696
As you go into another community,
there are bound to be changes.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.176
There is bound to be
a certain loss of identity,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.656
and this is what we will be
looking for in the future

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.936
if and when we do migrate.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.136
CA: It must have been
just an extraordinarily emotional day

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.976
because of these questions about identity,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.216
the joy of seeing you and perhaps
an emphasized sense of what they had lost.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.621
And it's very inspiring to hear you say
you're going to fight to the end

00:10:05.645 --> 00:10:10.056
to try to preserve
the nation in a location.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.376
AT: This is our wish.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.456
Nobody wants ever to leave their home,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.536
and so it's been
a very difficult decision for me.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.936
As a leader, you don't make plans
to leave your island, your home,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.216
and so I've been asked
on a number of occasions,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.456
"So how do you feel?"

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.616
And it doesn't feel good at all.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.216
It's an emotional thing,
and I've tried to live with it,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.176
and I know that on occasions, I'm accused
of not trying to solve the problem

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.176
because I can't solve the problem.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.016
It's something that's got
to be done collectively.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.816
Climate change is a global phenomenon,
and as I've often argued,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.336
unfortunately, the countries,
when we come to the United Nations --

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.256
I was in a meeting with
the Pacific Island Forum countries

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.776
where Australia and New Zealand
are also members,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.536
and we had an argument.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.256
There was a bit of a story in the news

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.576
because they were arguing
that to cut emissions,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.856
it would be something
that they're unable to do

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.096
because it would affect the industries.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.576
And so here I was saying,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.816
OK, I hear you,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.496
I understand what you're saying,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.776
but try also to understand what I'm saying

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.416
because if you do not cut your emissions,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.816
then our survival is on the line.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.176
And so it's a matter for you
to weigh this, these moral issues.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.216
It's about industry as opposed to
the survival of a people.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.896
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday
what made you angry,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.416
and you said, "I don't get angry."
But then you paused.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.056
I think this made you angry.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.976
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier
statement at the United Nations.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.936
I was very angry, very frustrated
and then depressed.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.936
There was a sense of futility

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.416
that we are fighting a fight
that we have no hope of winning.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.616
I had to change my approach.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.736
I had to become more reasonable

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.903
because I thought people would listen
to somebody who was rational,

00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:11.496
but I remain radically rational,
whatever that is.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.136
(Laughter)

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.896
CA: Now, a core part
of your nation's identity is fishing.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.416
I think you said pretty much everyone
is involved in fishing in some way.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.216
AT: Well, we eat fish
every day, every day,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.776
and I think there is no doubt
that our rate of consumption of fish

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.936
is perhaps the highest in the world.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.416
We don't have a lot of livestock,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.216
so it's fish that we depend on.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.376
CA: So you're dependent on fish,
both at the local level

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.096
and for the revenues
that the country receives

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.696
from the global fishing business for tuna,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.616
and yet despite that, a few years ago
you took a very radical step.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.016
Can you tell us about that?

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.376
I think something happened
right here in the Phoenix Islands.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.696
AT: Let me give some of the background
of what fish means for us.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.656
We have one of the largest
tuna fisheries remaining in the world.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.536
In the Pacific, I think we own
something like 60 percent

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.456
of the remaining tuna fisheries,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.736
and it remains relatively healthy
for some species, but not all.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.880
And Kiribati is one of the three
major resource owners,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.616
tuna resource owners.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.216
And at the moment, we have been getting

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.136
something like 80 to 90
percent of our revenue

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.616
from access fees, license fees.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.496
CA: Of your national revenue.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.336
AT: National revenue,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.176
which drives everything that we do

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.216
in governments, hospitals,
schools and what have you.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.456
But we decided to close this,
and it was a very difficult decision.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.016
I can assure you, politically,
locally, it was not easy,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.976
but I was convinced that we had to do this

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.576
in order to ensure
that the fishery remains sustainable.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.376
There had been some indications
that some of the species,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.536
in particular the bigeye,
was under serious threat.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.936
The yellowfin was also heavily fished.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.696
Skipjack remains healthy.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.496
And so we had to do something like that,
and so that was the reason I did that.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.416
Another reason why I did that

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.136
was because I had been asking
the international community

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.696
that in order to deal with climate change,
in order to fight climate change,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.616
there has got to be sacrifice,
there has got to be commitment.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.936
So in asking the international community
to make a sacrifice,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.776
I thought we ourselves
need to make that sacrifice.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.616
And so we made the sacrifice.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.583
And forgoing commercial fishing

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:50.216
in the Phoenix Islands protected area

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.096
would mean a loss of revenue.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.597
We are still trying to assess
what that loss would be

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:59.856
because we actually closed it off
at the beginning of this year,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.216
and so we will see by the end of this year

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.736
what it means in terms
of the lost revenue.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.016
CA: So there's so many things
playing into this.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:15.016
On the one hand,
it may prompt healthier fisheries.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.416
I mean, how much are you able
to move the price up

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.936
that you charge for the remaining areas?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.576
AT: The negotiations
have been very difficult,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.456
but we have managed
to raise the cost of a vessel day.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.096
For any vessel
to come in to fish for a day,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.736
we have raised the fee from --
it was $6,000 and $8,000,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.336
now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.576
And so there's been
that significant increase.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.176
But at the same time,
what's important to note is,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.536
whereas in the past these fishing boats

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.496
might be fishing in a day
and maybe catch 10 tons,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.416
now they're catching maybe 100 tons
because they've become so efficient.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.776
And so we've got to respond likewise.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.976
We've got to be very, very careful
because the technology has so improved.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.416
There was a time when the Brazilian fleet
moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.656
They couldn't.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.896
They started experimenting
if they could, per se.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.600
But now they've got ways of doing it,
and they've become so efficient.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.198
CA: Can you give us a sense
of what it's like in those negotiations?

00:16:24.223 --> 00:16:25.920
Because you're up against companies

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:29.536
that have hundreds of millions
of dollars at stake, essentially.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.896
How do you hold the line?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.976
Is there any advice you can give

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.056
to other leaders who are dealing
with the same companies

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.376
about how to get
the most for your country,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.416
get the most for the fish?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.976
What advice would you give?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.256
AT: Well, I think we focus
too often on licensing

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.947
in order to get the rate of return,

00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:58.776
because what we are getting
from license fees

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.416
is about 10 percent
of the landed value of the catch

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.576
on the side of the wharf,
not in the retail shops.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.576
And we only get about 10 percent.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.216
What we have been trying
to do over the years

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.096
is actually to increase
our participation in the industry,

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.736
in the harvesting, in the processing,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.617
and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.

00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:23.336
They're not easy to penetrate,

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.656
but we are working towards that,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.296
and yes, the answer would be to enhance.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.536
In order to increase our rate of return,
we have to become more involved.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.736
And so we've started doing that,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.016
and we have to restructure the industry.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.416
We've got to tell these people
that the world has changed.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.856
Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.976
CA: And meanwhile,
for your local fishermen,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.096
they are still able to fish,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.576
but what is business like for them?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.936
Is it getting harder?
Are the waters depleted?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.416
Or is that being run
on a sustainable basis?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.896
AT: For the artisanal fishery,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.176
we do not participate
in the commercial fishing activity

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.216
except only to supply the domestic market.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.536
The tuna fishery is really
entirely for the foreign market,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.776
mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.336
So I am a fisherman, very much,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.536
and I used to be able to catch yellowfin.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.336
Now it's very, very rare
to be able to catch yellowfin

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.736
because they are being lifted
out of the water by the hundreds of tons

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.640
by these purse seiners.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.296
CA: So here's a couple
of beautiful girls from your country.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.536
I mean, as you think about their future,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.216
what message would you have for them

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.256
and what message
would you have for the world?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.709
AT: Well, I've been telling the world
that we really have to do something

00:18:51.733 --> 00:18:53.576
about what is happening to the climate

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.376
because for us, it's about
the future of these children.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.336
I have 12 grandchildren, at least.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.376
I think I have 12, my wife knows.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.616
(Laughter)

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.656
And I think I have eight children.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.936
It's about their future.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.696
Every day I see my grandchildren,
about the same age as these young girls,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.136
and I do wonder,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.376
and I get angry sometimes, yes I do.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.456
I wonder what is to become of them.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.616
And so it's about them

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.896
that we should be telling everybody,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.176
that it's not about
their own national interest,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.856
because climate change,
regrettably, unfortunately,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.976
is viewed by many countries
as a national problem. It's not.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And this is the argument
we got into recently with our partners,

00:19:36.024 --> 00:19:37.720
the Australians and New Zealanders,

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:41.056
because they said,
"We can't cut any more."

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.696
This is what one of the leaders,
the Australian leader, said,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.976
that we've done our part,
we are cutting back.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.656
I said, What about the rest?
Why don't you keep it?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.376
If you could keep
the rest of your emissions

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.696
within your boundaries,
within your borders,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.496
we'd have no question.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.336
You can go ahead as much as you like.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.496
But unfortunately,
you're sending it our way,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.711
and it's affecting
the future of our children.

00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:10.776
And so surely I think that is the heart
of the problem of climate change today.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.856
We will be meeting in Paris
at the end of this year,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.816
but until we can think of this
as a global phenomenon,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.096
because we create it,
individually, as nations,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.056
but it affects everybody else,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.696
and yet, we refuse
to do anything about it,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.176
and we deal with it as a national problem,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.296
which it is not -- it is a global issue,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.040
and it's got to be
dealt with collectively.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.456
CA: People are incredibly bad
at responding to graphs and numbers,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.256
and we shut our minds to it.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.536
Somehow, to people, we're slightly better
at responding to that sometimes.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.496
And it seems like it's
very possible that your nation,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.976
despite, actually because of
the intense problems you face,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.896
you may yet be the warning light
to the world that shines most visibly,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.896
most powerfully.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.737
I just want to thank you, 
I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,

00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:09.256
for your extraordinary leadership
and for being here.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.853
Mr. President, thank you so much.

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:11.646
AT: Thank you.

00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:14.120
(Applause)
