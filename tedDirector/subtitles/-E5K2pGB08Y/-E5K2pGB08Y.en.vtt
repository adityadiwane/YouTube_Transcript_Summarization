(Music)

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.971
Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.714
but ...

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.022
we can see you really clearly --

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:25.086
(Laughter)

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.583
So you have to dance with us.

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:29.013
And we have this, like,

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:31.523
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do --

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:32.758
Betta Lemme: Really easy.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.599
SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:37.259
and you're going to do it with us.

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.254
And you can also stand up.

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.804
(Music)

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.830
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:51.417
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:52.948
It came, it came,

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:54.138
it went, it went

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:55.922
It conquered quick

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:59.525
I was there and then I quit

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.841
Awoo!

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.538
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:07.383
I know I did not capture it

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:08.567
It came, it came,

00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:09.757
it went, it went

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.541
It conquered quick

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:14.900
I was there and then I quit

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:16.746
Awoo!

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.238

00:01:18.262 --> 00:01:22.285
(Music)

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:24.019
SHW: We have another one coming up.

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:25.777
It's a little finger-pointing dance.

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.801
(Music)

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.035
The people sitting down,

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:44.068
I want to see your fingers pointing.

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:45.839
Yeah!

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:50.345

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.228
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:55.419
It came, it came,

00:01:55.443 --> 00:01:56.594
it went, it went

00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:58.405
It conquered quick

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.830
I was there and then I quit

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:07.235
Aaaa ...

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:09.936
(Applause)

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.182

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:23.684

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:33.737
SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:37.163
(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:41.001
I know I did not capture it

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.182
It came, it came,

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:43.364
it went, it went

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:45.139
It conquered quick

00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:48.488
I was there and then I quit

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:52.848
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:56.671
I know I did not capture it

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:57.845
It came, it came,

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.021
it went, it went

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.811
