00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:21.875
You know, we wake up in the morning,

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.395
you get dressed, put on your shoes,

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.907
you head out into the world.

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:31.158
You plan on coming back, getting undressed,

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.383
going to bed,

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:35.137
waking up, doing it again,

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:38.285
and that anticipation, that rhythm,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:40.555
helps give us a structure

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:44.143
to how we organize ourselves and our lives,

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.623
and gives it a measure of predictability.

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:50.011
Living in New York City, as I do,

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:57.250
it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.600
at the same time in such close quarters,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.839
it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.365
out of that deck.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:10.033
You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:15.036
that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:17.379
And you never think you're going to be the guy

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.009
who's walking down the street

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.431
and, because you choose to go down one side or the other,

00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.591
the rest of your life is changed forever.

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:31.319
And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.815
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:36.932
when I get on the subway.

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:39.978
I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones

00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:41.361
or a book.

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.167
And I get on the car, and I look, and I

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.751
notice this couple,

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.239
college-aged, student-looking kids,

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.036
a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:54.685
and she's got her leg draped over his knee,

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:58.845
and they're doing -- they have this little contraption,

00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:00.603
and they're tying these knots,

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:02.440
and they're doing it with one hand,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.404
they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,

00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:08.652
and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.

00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:09.853
I've never seen anything like this.

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:13.237
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:17.556
And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:21.534
and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:23.654
He's got the overstuffed leather satchel

00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:26.964
and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:29.476
and the tweed jacket with the leather patches,

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:31.453
and — (Laughter) —

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:34.276
he looks at them, and then

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:37.292
in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:38.957
and he starts to say,

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:41.026
"You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:43.645
if you do this -- " and he takes the laces out of their hand,

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:46.956
and instantly, he starts tying these knots,

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:51.617
and even better than they were doing it, remarkably.

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:54.697
And it turns out they are medical students

00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:56.809
on their way to a lecture about the latest

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.035
suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:01.643
(Laughter)

00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:04.057
So he starts to tell them, and he's like,

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:06.565
"No, this is very important here. You know,

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:08.845
when you're needing these knots,

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.437
it's going to be, you know, everything's

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:14.190
going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be --

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.827
you're going to have all this information coming at you,

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:19.323
there's going to be organs getting in the way,

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:21.358
it's going to be slippery,

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:22.668
and

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.426
it's just very important that you be able to do these

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.796
beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:31.624
you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."

00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:33.994
And at that moment, when I heard that,

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:41.066
I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:44.200
when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.691
from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed

00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:53.010
to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.999
and what had happened was

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.208
a gang had come in from Brooklyn.

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.831
As part of an initiation for three of their members,

00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:02.535
they had to kill somebody,

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:05.922
and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:07.219
that night,

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.656
and they jumped on me without a word.

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.981
One of the very lucky things,

00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:16.989
when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.637
so I put my hands up right away, instinctively.

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:25.189
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.482
and he went in under my elbow,

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:32.949
and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.669
If you know anything about anatomy,

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.377
that's not a good thing to get cut,

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.535
and everything, of course, on the way up,

00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:41.425
and then — I still had my hands up —

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:43.914
he pulled it out and went for my neck,

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:48.119
and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.843
and I got one straight right punch

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:52.614
and knocked the middle guy out.

00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:54.827
The other guy was still working on me,

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.692
collapsing my other lung,

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:02.672
and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.

00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:04.765
I ran down the street and collapsed,

00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:07.812
and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:10.285
and let the trauma room know

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:11.903
they had an incoming.

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:14.902
And one of the

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:18.843
side effects of having major massive blood loss

00:05:18.843 --> 00:05:20.690
is you get tunnel vision,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.503
so I remember being on the stretcher

00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:26.508
and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,

00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:28.057
and I was moving my head around

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:29.413
and we got to St. Vincent's,

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:31.056
and we're racing down this hallway,

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.324
and I see the lights going,

00:05:33.324 --> 00:05:40.052
and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.

00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:44.231
They don't really go to the usual place that memories go.

00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:49.435
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,

00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.920
and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.416
So sometimes, remembering them, it's like,

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:02.140
it's not like any other kind of memories.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.812
And I get into the trauma room,

00:06:04.812 --> 00:06:07.834
and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:13.129
and I'd been able to breathe a little more now,

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.608
because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:18.574
and I was having a very hard time breathing,

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:21.616
but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:24.920
And I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?"

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.692
and — (Laughter) —

00:06:26.692 --> 00:06:30.006
the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:32.254
I'm turning my head trying to see everybody,

00:06:32.254 --> 00:06:36.070
and I had this weird memory of being in college

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.982
and raising,

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:43.039
raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.496
and then I look over and my anesthesiologist

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:47.029
is clamping the mask on me, and I think,

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.090
"He looks Bangladeshi," — (Laughter) —

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.575
and I just have those two facts, and I just think,

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:56.289
"This could work somehow." (Laughter)

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.567
And then I go out, and

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:00.343
they work on me for the rest of the night,

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:05.356
and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there

00:07:05.356 --> 00:07:08.401
while they did their work,

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:12.625
and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:16.044
my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:18.415
and he later told me one of the last things he did

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:21.760
while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.983
which I thought was great, you know,

00:07:23.983 --> 00:07:27.146
just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:31.464
And I came to in the morning.

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:33.280
Out of anesthetic, he had let them know

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.768
that he wanted to be there, and he had given me

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:39.963
about a two percent chance of living.

00:07:39.963 --> 00:07:41.875
So he was there when I woke up,

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.036
and it was, waking up was like

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:50.253
breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.

00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:52.356
It was that enveloping,

00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:56.528
and there was only one spot that didn't hurt

00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:58.001
worse than anything I'd ever felt,

00:07:58.001 --> 00:07:59.407
and it was my instep,

00:07:59.407 --> 00:08:03.153
and he was holding the arch of my foot

00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:07.021
and rubbing the instep with his thumb.

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.957
And I looked up, and he's like,

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:11.078
"Good to see you,"

00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:15.014
and I was trying to remember what had happened

00:08:15.014 --> 00:08:16.732
and trying to get my head around everything,

00:08:16.732 --> 00:08:20.789
and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:24.165
"You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought

00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:28.537
you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,

00:08:28.537 --> 00:08:31.320
and you're going to need all the strength you can get."

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.029
And in those days, my hair was down to my waist,

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.901
I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,

00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:43.210
I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.470
But

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.442
I had three days of life support,

00:08:48.442 --> 00:08:52.223
and everybody was expecting,

00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:56.716
due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do

00:08:56.716 --> 00:08:58.544
that I wasn't going to make it,

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.589
so it was three days of

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:03.416
everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,

00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:05.012
and — (Laughter) —

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.971
when I finally pooped, then that somehow,

00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:11.378
surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,

00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:12.418
and, um — (Laughter) —

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:15.683
on that day, the surgeon came in

00:09:15.683 --> 00:09:18.875
and whipped the sheet off of me.

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.536
He had three or four friends with him,

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:22.938
and he does that, and they all look,

00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:24.819
and there was no infection,

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:27.689
and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:29.786
and they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah,

00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.656
look at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.579
and I'm, like, this restored automobile

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:38.770
that he's just going, "Yeah, I did that." (Laughter)

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.794
And it was just,

00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:44.930
it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.990
over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.511
And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in

00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:51.747
and everything.

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:53.962
And

00:09:53.962 --> 00:09:56.573
later on, when I got out

00:09:56.573 --> 00:10:02.185
and the flashbacks and the

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:06.690
nightmares were giving me a hard time,

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.372
I went back to him

00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:12.265
and I was sort of asking him,

00:10:12.265 --> 00:10:14.446
you know, what am I gonna do?

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:19.054
And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,

00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:20.780
"Kid, I saved your life.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.430
Like, now you can do whatever you want, like,

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.096
you gotta get on with that.

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:26.928
It's like I gave you a new car

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:29.220
and you're complaining about not finding parking.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.821
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.

00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:37.627
But you're alive. That's what it's about."

00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:43.408
And then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:49.647
are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,

00:10:49.647 --> 00:10:51.516
and I go, I think to myself,

00:10:51.516 --> 00:10:53.078
"I'm going to lift my shirt up

00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:54.695
and show them," — (Laughter) —

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.924
and then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway,

00:10:56.924 --> 00:11:00.555
that's going to lead to other things." (Laughter)

00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:04.597
And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:08.558
I step off, I'm standing on the platform,

00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:11.422
and I feel my index finger

00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:13.601
in

00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:17.304
the first scar that I ever got,

00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:20.418
from my umbilical cord,

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:23.656
and then around that, is traced

00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:26.152
the last scar that I got

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.529
from my surgeon,

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:33.843
and I think that, that chance encounter

00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:37.732
with those kids on the street with their knives

00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:40.165
led me

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:43.290
to my surgical team,

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.365
and their training

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:49.481
and their skill

00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.901
and, always, a little bit of luck

00:11:52.901 --> 00:11:55.872
pushed back against chaos.

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:59.926
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:59.926 --> 00:12:08.870
(Applause)

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:15.290
Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)
