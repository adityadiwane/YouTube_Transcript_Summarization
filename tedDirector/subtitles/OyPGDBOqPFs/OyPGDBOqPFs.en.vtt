00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I normally teach courses on

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
how to rebuild states after war.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
This is a picture of my family,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
And we're actually Cambodians.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
to explain the Khmer Rouge regime

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
during 1975 and 1979.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Video: April 17th, 1975.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
The communist Khmer Rouge

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
and American bombing campaigns.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
Led by peasant-born Pol Pot,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
in order to create a rural communist utopia,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.160
much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
In a country of only seven million people,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Sophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
on April 17th 1975

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
we lived in Phnom Penh.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
because they're easy to bring into wars.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
more munitions that fell on Cambodia

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
than in all of World War II Japan,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
including the two nuclear bombs

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
of August 1945.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
in Cambodia was bombed.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
But not just that, they actually banned money.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
I think it's the only precedent in which

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
money has ever been stopped from being used.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And we know money is the root of all evil,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
where rice growing takes place.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
So my father and mother ended up in

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
a sort of concentration camp, labor camp.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
And it was at that time that my mother got word

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
from the commune chief

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
that the Vietnamese were actually asking

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And she spoke some Vietnamese,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
that she would take the chance

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
and claim to be Vietnamese

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
so that we could have a chance to survive,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And they're giving about --

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess --

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
And at about this time actually

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
my father got very sick.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And he didn't speak Vietnamese.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
So he died actually, in January 1976.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And it made it possible, in fact,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
for us to take on this plan.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
So the Khmer Rouge took us

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
which is across from the border from Vietnam.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And there they had a detention camp

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.160
where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
that to make our story more credible,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
But she'd given the boys girls' names,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
and the girls boys' names.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
that she was able to go into her exam

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And then onwards to Chau Doc.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
But for us it meant freedom.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Last year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
started, and I decided that as a matter of record

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
I should file a Civil Complaint

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
And I got word last month

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And she was able to return to a place

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
that for her meant freedom, but also fear,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
because we had just come out of Cambodia.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
She's here today with us in the audience.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Thank you mother.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:52.160
(Applause)
