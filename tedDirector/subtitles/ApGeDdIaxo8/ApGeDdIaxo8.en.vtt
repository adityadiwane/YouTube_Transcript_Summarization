00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.714
So I've had the great privilege

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:17.154
of traveling to some incredible places,

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:21.412
photographing these distant landscapes
and remote cultures

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:22.862
all over the world.

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.296
I love my job.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.885
But people think it's
this string of epiphanies

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.398
and sunrises and rainbows,

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:32.186
when in reality, it looks
more something like this.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.432
(Laughter)

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:34.981
This is my office.

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:38.104
We can't afford the fanciest places
to stay at night,

00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:40.966
so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:42.794
As long as we can stay dry,

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:44.219
that's a bonus.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.648
We also can't afford
the fanciest restaurants.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.592
So we tend to eat
whatever's on the local menu.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.117
And if you're in the Ecuadorian PÃ¡ramo,

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.903
you're going to eat
a large rodent called a cuy.

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:57.544
(Laughter)

00:00:57.568 --> 00:01:01.186
But what makes our experiences
perhaps a little bit different

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.932
and a little more unique
than that of the average person

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:07.412
is that we have this gnawing thing
in the back of our mind

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:11.353
that even in our darkest moments,
and those times of despair,

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:15.279
we think, "Hey, there might be
an image to be made here,

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.426
there might be a story to be told."

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.081
And why is storytelling important?

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.039
Well, it helps us to connect with our
cultural and our natural heritage.

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:26.222
And in the Southeast,

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:29.304
there's an alarming disconnect
between the public

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:33.051
and the natural areas that allow
us to be here in the first place.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.975
We're visual creatures,

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.351
so we use what we see
to teach us what we know.

00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:42.171
Now the majority of us
aren't going to willingly go

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.847
way down to a swamp.

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:48.232
So how can we still expect
those same people to then advocate

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:49.974
on behalf of their protection?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.584
We can't.

00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:55.853
So my job, then, is to use photography
as a communication tool,

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:59.852
to help bridge the gap
between the science and the aesthetics,

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:01.494
to get people talking,

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:02.887
to get them thinking,

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:04.568
and to hopefully, ultimately,

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:05.983
get them caring.

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.751
I started doing this 15 years ago
right here in Gainesville,

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.650
right here in my backyard.

00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:14.522
And I fell in love
with adventure and discovery,

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.603
going to explore
all these different places

00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:18.920
that were just minutes
from my front doorstep.

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:21.532
There are a lot
of beautiful places to find.

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:24.174
Despite all these years that have passed,

00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:26.492
I still see the world
through the eyes of a child

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:29.369
and I try to incorporate
that sense of wonderment

00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:34.074
and that sense of curiosity
into my photography

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:35.848
as often as I can.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.304
And we're pretty lucky
because here in the South,

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:42.400
we're still blessed
with a relatively blank canvas

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:45.608
that we can fill with the most
fanciful adventures

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.079
and incredible experiences.

00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:52.047
It's just a matter of how far
our imagination will take us.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.601
See, a lot of people
look at this and they say,

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.403
"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:57.898
But I don't just see a tree --

00:02:57.922 --> 00:03:00.501
I look at this and I see opportunity.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.122
I see an entire weekend.

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:05.759
Because when I was a kid,
these were the types of images

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:08.251
that got me off the sofa
and dared me to explore,

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:09.716
dared me to go find the woods

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.635
and put my head underwater
and see what we have.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.234
And folks, I've been photographing
all over the world

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:17.599
and I promise you,

00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:19.118
what we have here in the South,

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:20.823
what we have in the Sunshine State,

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:23.142
rivals anything else that I've seen.

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:27.955
But yet our tourism industry is busy
promoting all the wrong things.

00:03:28.698 --> 00:03:31.429
Before most kids are 12,
they'll have been to Disney World

00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:33.414
more times than they've been in a canoe

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:36.280
or camping under a starry sky.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:40.363
And I have nothing against Disney
or Mickey; I used to go there, too.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.046
But they're missing out on those
fundamental connections

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.292
that create a real sense
of pride and ownership

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:48.419
for the place that they call home.

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.290
And this is compounded by the issue
that the landscapes

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:54.423
that define our natural heritage

00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:57.423
and fuel our aquifer
for our drinking water

00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:01.890
have been deemed as scary
and dangerous and spooky.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.082
When our ancestors first came here,

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:06.742
they warned, "Stay out
of these areas, they're haunted.

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:09.863
They're full of evil spirits and ghosts."

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:12.233
I don't know where
they came up with that idea.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:15.436
But it's actually led
to a very real disconnect,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.221
a very real negative mentality

00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:20.823
that has kept the public
disinterested, silent,

00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:23.412
and ultimately, our environment at risk.

00:04:24.523 --> 00:04:27.975
We're a state that's surrounded
and defined by water,

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.275
and yet for centuries,

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:31.192
swamps and wetlands have been regarded

00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:33.923
as these obstacles to overcome.

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:38.349
And so we've treated them
as these second-class ecosystems,

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:40.637
because they have
very little monetary value

00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:44.346
and of course, they're known
to harbor alligators and snakes --

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.668
which, I'll admit, these aren't
the most cuddly of ambassadors.

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:48.828
(Laughter)

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:51.630
So it became assumed, then,
that the only good swamp

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:52.972
was a drained swamp.

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:54.515
And in fact,

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.950
draining a swamp to make way
for agriculture and development

00:04:57.974 --> 00:05:01.887
was considered the very essence
of conservation not too long ago.

00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:04.068
But now we're backpedaling,

00:05:04.092 --> 00:05:07.443
because the more we come to learn
about these sodden landscapes,

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.433
the more secrets we're starting to unlock

00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:11.820
about interspecies relationships

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:16.394
and the connectivity of habitats,
watersheds and flyways.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.025
Take this bird, for example:

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:20.937
this is the prothonotary warbler.

00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:23.147
I love this bird because
it's a swamp bird,

00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:24.875
through and through, a swamp bird.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:28.547
They nest and they mate and they breed
in these old-growth swamps

00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.035
in these flooded forests.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.607
And so after the spring,
after they raise their young,

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:35.436
they then fly thousand of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.409
into Central and South America.

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:39.058
And then after the winter,

00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:41.097
the spring rolls around
and they come back.

00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:44.020
They fly thousands of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.950
And where do they go? Where do they land?

00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:49.990
Right back in the same tree.

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:51.836
That's nuts.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.498
This is a bird the size
of a tennis ball --

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.199
I mean, that's crazy!

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:59.773
I used a GPS to get here today,

00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:01.464
and this is my hometown.

00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:02.759
(Laughter)

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:03.940
It's crazy.

00:06:04.374 --> 00:06:08.064
So what happens, then, when this bird
flies over the Gulf of Mexico

00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:09.956
into Central America for the winter

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.421
and then the spring rolls around
and it flies back,

00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:15.212
and it comes back to this:

00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:17.130
a freshly sodded golf course?

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:20.531
This is a narrative that's
all too commonly unraveling

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:21.742
here in this state.

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:25.005
And this is a natural process
that's occurred for thousands of years

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.807
and we're just now learning about it.

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.994
So you can imagine all else we have
to learn about these landscapes

00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:31.876
if we just preserve them first.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.431
Now despite all this rich life
that abounds in these swamps,

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:38.279
they still have a bad name.

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:42.494
Many people feel uncomfortable
with the idea of wading

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:44.182
into Florida's blackwater.

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:45.995
I can understand that.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:49.160
But what I loved about growing up
in the Sunshine State

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:50.466
is that for so many of us,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.279
we live with this latent
but very palpable fear

00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:56.644
that when we put our toes into the water,

00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:59.650
there might be something much more ancient

00:06:59.674 --> 00:07:01.811
and much more adapted than we are.

00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:07.463
Knowing that you're not top dog
is a welcomed discomfort, I think.

00:07:08.082 --> 00:07:11.968
How often in this modern
and urban and digital age

00:07:11.992 --> 00:07:15.636
do you actually get the chance
to feel vulnerable,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.826
or consider that the world may not
have been made for just us?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.132
So for the last decade,

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:24.551
I began seeking out these areas
where the concrete yields to forest

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:26.753
and the pines turn to cypress,

00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:30.422
and I viewed all these
mosquitoes and reptiles,

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:31.945
all these discomforts,

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.501
as affirmations that I'd found
true wilderness,

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:37.685
and I embrace them wholly.

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:41.112
Now as a conservation photographer
obsessed with blackwater,

00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:43.256
it's only fitting that I'd
eventually end up

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.457
in the most famous swamp of all:

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:46.731
the Everglades.

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:49.113
Growing up here in North Central Florida,

00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:50.867
it always had these enchanted names,

00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:54.233
places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:56.379
Corkscrew, Big Cypress.

00:07:56.403 --> 00:07:59.943
I started what turned
into a five-year project

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:03.717
to hopefully reintroduce
the Everglades in a new light,

00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.422
in a more inspired light.

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:09.147
But I knew this would be a tall order,
because here you have an area

00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.200
that's roughly a third the size
the state of Florida, it's huge.

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:13.501
And when I say Everglades,

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:15.993
most people are like,
"Oh, yeah, the national park."

00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:21.030
But the Everglades is not just a park;
it's an entire watershed,

00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:24.059
starting with the Kissimmee
chain of lakes in the north,

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.308
and then as the rains
would fall in the summer,

00:08:26.332 --> 00:08:28.964
these downpours would flow
into Lake Okeechobee,

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:32.235
and Lake Okeechobee would fill up
and it would overflow its banks

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.533
and spill southward, ever slowly,
with the topography,

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.153
and get into the river of grass,
the Sawgrass Prairies,

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:40.222
before meting into the cypress slews,

00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:42.933
until going further south
into the mangrove swamps,

00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:46.707
and then finally -- finally --
reaching Florida Bay,

00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.504
the emerald gem of the Everglades,

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.711
the great estuary,

00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:51.988
the 850 square-mile estuary.

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:56.797
So sure, the national park
is the southern end of this system,

00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.124
but all the things that make it unique
are these inputs that come in,

00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:02.955
the fresh water that starts
100 miles north.

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:06.244
So no manner of these political
or invisible boundaries

00:09:06.268 --> 00:09:10.655
protect the park from polluted water
or insufficient water.

00:09:11.242 --> 00:09:14.068
And unfortunately, that's precisely
what we've done.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.163
Over the last 60 years,

00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:19.544
we have drained, we have dammed,
we have dredged the Everglades

00:09:19.568 --> 00:09:23.549
to where now only one third of the water
that used to reach the bay

00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:25.580
now reaches the bay today.

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:30.254
So this story is not all sunshine
and rainbows, unfortunately.

00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:32.839
For better or for worse,

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:36.280
the story of the Everglades
is intrinsically tied

00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:39.500
to the peaks and the valleys
of mankind's relationship

00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:40.864
with the natural world.

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:43.280
But I'll show you
these beautiful pictures,

00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:44.765
because it gets you on board.

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:47.917
And while I have your attention,
I can tell you the real story.

00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:49.892
It's that we're taking this,

00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:52.879
and we're trading it for this,

00:09:52.903 --> 00:09:54.398
at an alarming rate.

00:09:55.358 --> 00:09:57.068
And what's lost on so many people

00:09:57.092 --> 00:09:59.603
is the sheer scale
of which we're discussing.

00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:03.055
Because the Everglades is not just
responsible for the drinking water

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:05.283
for 7 million Floridians;

00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:07.845
today it also provides
the agricultural fields

00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:10.428
for the year-round tomatoes and oranges

00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:13.283
for over 300 million Americans.

00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:17.705
And it's that same seasonal pulse
of water in the summer

00:10:17.729 --> 00:10:21.622
that built the river of grass
6,000 years ago.

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:26.662
Ironically, today, it's also responsible
for the over half a million acres

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:29.141
of the endless river of sugarcane.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:32.068
These are the same fields
that are responsible

00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:36.116
for dumping exceedingly high levels
of fertilizers into the watershed,

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.303
forever changing the system.

00:10:38.749 --> 00:10:41.961
But in order for you to not just
understand how this system works,

00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:44.048
but to also get personally
connected to it,

00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:47.347
I decided to break the story down
into several different narratives.

00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:50.159
And I wanted that story to start
in Lake Okeechobee,

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:52.930
the beating heart of the Everglade system.

00:10:52.954 --> 00:10:55.417
And to do that, I picked an ambassador,

00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:56.690
an iconic species.

00:10:57.204 --> 00:10:59.196
This is the Everglade snail kite.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.966
It's a great bird,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.864
and they used to nest in the thousands,

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:04.691
thousands in the northern Everglades.

00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:08.219
And then they've gone down
to about 400 nesting pairs today.

00:11:08.243 --> 00:11:09.588
And why is that?

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:12.736
Well, it's because they eat
one source of food, an apple snail,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.161
about the size of a ping-pong ball,
an aquatic gastropod.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:19.410
So as we started damming up
the Everglades,

00:11:19.434 --> 00:11:22.911
as we started diking Lake Okeechobee
and draining the wetlands,

00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:25.047
we lost the habitat for the snail.

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:27.863
And thus, the population
of the kites declined.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:31.950
And so, I wanted a photo that would
not only communicate this relationship

00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:35.063
between wetland, snail and bird,

00:11:35.087 --> 00:11:37.336
but I also wanted a photo
that would communicate

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.154
how incredible this relationship was,

00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:44.334
and how very important it is
that they've come to depend on each other,

00:11:44.358 --> 00:11:46.025
this healthy wetland and this bird.

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:48.021
And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.

00:11:48.045 --> 00:11:51.283
I started sketching
out these plans to make a photo,

00:11:51.307 --> 00:11:54.194
and I sent it to the wildlife biologist
down in Okeechobee --

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:57.305
this is an endangered bird,
so it takes special permission to do.

00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:59.023
So I built this submerged platform

00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:01.529
that would hold snails
just right under the water.

00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:06.011
And I spent months planning
this crazy idea.

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:09.011
And I took this platform
down to Lake Okeechobee

00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:11.107
and I spent over a week in the water,

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.847
wading waist-deep,
9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,

00:12:14.871 --> 00:12:18.031
to get one image that I thought
might communicate this.

00:12:18.055 --> 00:12:20.270
And here's the day that it finally worked:

00:12:20.294 --> 00:12:23.151
[Video: (Mac Stone narrating)
After setting up the platform,

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.712
I look off and I see a kite
coming over the cattails.

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:27.658
And I see him scanning and searching.

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:29.287
And he gets right over the trap,

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:30.832
and I see that he's seen it.

00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:33.579
And he beelines,
he goes straight for the trap.

00:12:33.603 --> 00:12:36.759
And in that moment,
all those months of planning, waiting,

00:12:36.783 --> 00:12:38.893
all the sunburn, mosquito bites --

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:41.455
suddenly, they're all worth it.

00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:45.394
(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,
I can't believe it!]

00:12:45.695 --> 00:12:48.292
You can believe how excited I was
when that happened.

00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:49.656
But what the idea was,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.879
is that for someone
who's never seen this bird

00:12:51.903 --> 00:12:53.973
and has no reason to care about it,

00:12:53.997 --> 00:12:56.622
these photos, these new perspectives,

00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:59.768
will help shed a little new light
on just one species

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:04.074
that makes this watershed
so incredible, so valuable, so important.

00:13:04.615 --> 00:13:07.538
Now, I know I can't come
here to Gainesville

00:13:07.562 --> 00:13:09.808
and talk to you about animals
in the Everglades

00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:11.620
without talking about gators.

00:13:11.644 --> 00:13:13.934
I love gators, I grew up loving gators.

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:17.777
My parents always said I had
an unhealthy relationship with gators.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.269
But what I like about them is,

00:13:19.293 --> 00:13:21.897
they're like the freshwater
equivalent of sharks.

00:13:21.921 --> 00:13:23.569
They're feared, they're hated,

00:13:23.593 --> 00:13:25.957
and they are tragically misunderstood.

00:13:26.386 --> 00:13:30.150
Because these are a unique species,
they're not just apex predators.

00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:31.464
In the Everglades,

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:33.982
they are the very architects
of the Everglades,

00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:36.149
because as the water drops
down in the winter

00:13:36.173 --> 00:13:37.331
during the dry season,

00:13:37.355 --> 00:13:40.377
they start excavating these holes
called gator holes.

00:13:40.401 --> 00:13:42.711
And they do this because
as the water drops down,

00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:46.122
they'll be able to stay wet
and they'll be able to forage.

00:13:46.645 --> 00:13:48.964
And now this isn't just affecting them,

00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:51.221
other animals also depend
on this relationship,

00:13:51.245 --> 00:13:53.923
so they become a keystone species as well.

00:13:54.677 --> 00:13:58.912
So how do you make an apex predator,
an ancient reptile,

00:13:58.936 --> 00:14:01.414
at once look like it dominates the system,

00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:03.881
but at the same time, look vulnerable?

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:08.749
Well, you wade into a pit
of about 120 of them,

00:14:08.773 --> 00:14:11.179
then you hope that you've made
the right decision.

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:12.967
(Laughter)

00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:15.915
I still have all my fingers, it's cool.

00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:19.379
But I understand, I know
I'm not going to rally you guys,

00:14:19.403 --> 00:14:23.013
I'm not going to rally the troops to
"Save the Everglades for the gators!"

00:14:23.037 --> 00:14:25.235
It won't happen because
they're so ubiquitous,

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:26.410
we see them now,

00:14:26.434 --> 00:14:29.776
they're one of the great conservation
success stories of the US.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.126
But there is one species in the Everglades
that no matter who you are,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.229
you can't help but love, too,
and that's the roseate spoonbill.

00:14:36.253 --> 00:14:39.884
These birds are great, but they've had
a really tough time in the Everglades,

00:14:39.908 --> 00:14:43.374
because they started out with thousands
of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,

00:14:43.398 --> 00:14:45.461
and at the turn of the 20th century,

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:49.077
they got down to two -- two nesting pairs.

00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:50.265
And why?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.577
That's because women thought
they looked better on their hats

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.614
then they did flying in the sky.

00:14:56.324 --> 00:14:58.733
Then we banned the plume trade,

00:14:58.757 --> 00:15:00.875
and their numbers started rebounding.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.924
And as their numbers started rebounding,

00:15:02.948 --> 00:15:04.687
scientists began to pay attention,

00:15:04.711 --> 00:15:06.424
they started studying these birds.

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:07.933
And what they found out is that

00:15:07.957 --> 00:15:10.115
these birds' behavior
is intrinsically tied

00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:13.057
to the annual draw-down
cycle of water in the Everglades,

00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:15.760
the thing that defines
the Everglades watershed.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:17.828
What they found out is that

00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:20.920
these birds started nesting in the winter
as the water drew down,

00:15:20.944 --> 00:15:24.524
because they're tactile feeders,
so they have to touch whatever they eat.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.646
And so they wait for these
concentrated pools of fish

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.067
to be able to feed enough
to feed their young.

00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:33.866
So these birds became the very icon
of the Everglades --

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.382
an indicator species
of the overall health of the system.

00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:40.613
And just as their numbers were rebounding
in the mid-20th century --

00:15:40.637 --> 00:15:45.286
shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.066
just as that started happening, we started
draining the southern Everglades.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.594
And we stopped two-thirds
of that water from moving south.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.117
And it had drastic consequences.

00:15:55.584 --> 00:15:58.198
And just as those numbers
started reaching their peak,

00:15:58.222 --> 00:16:01.295
unfortunately, today,
the real spoonbill story,

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:05.936
the real photo of what it looks like
is more something like this.

00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:11.623
And we're down to less than 70
nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,

00:16:11.647 --> 00:16:14.191
because we've disrupted
the system so much.

00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:17.466
So all these different organizations
are shouting, they're screaming,

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.505
"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:20.680
It is not.

00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:22.254
It is resilient.

00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:25.770
Because despite all we've taken,
despite all we've done and we've drained

00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:27.633
and we've dammed and we've dredged it,

00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:30.553
pieces of it are still here,
waiting to be put back together.

00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:32.831
And this is what I've loved
about South Florida,

00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:36.629
that in one place, you have
this unstoppable force of mankind

00:16:36.653 --> 00:16:40.088
meeting the immovable object
of tropical nature.

00:16:40.973 --> 00:16:44.813
And it's at this new frontier
that we are forced with a new appraisal.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.520
What is wilderness worth?

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:50.213
What is the value of biodiversity,
or our drinking water?

00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:53.628
And fortunately, after decades of debate,

00:16:53.652 --> 00:16:56.619
we're finally starting to act
on those questions.

00:16:56.643 --> 00:16:59.000
We're slowly undertaking these projects

00:16:59.024 --> 00:17:01.520
to bring more freshwater back to the bay.

00:17:01.544 --> 00:17:05.199
But it's up to us as citizens,
as residents, as stewards

00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:08.178
to hold our elected officials
to their promises.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.987
What can you do to help?

00:17:11.011 --> 00:17:12.266
It's so easy.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.258
Just get outside, get out there.

00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:16.313
Take your friends out, take your kids out,

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:17.912
take your family out.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.598
Hire a fishing guide.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.605
Show the state that protecting wilderness

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:25.716
not only makes ecological sense,
but economic sense as well.

00:17:26.288 --> 00:17:29.615
It's a lot of fun, just do it --
put your feet in the water.

00:17:29.639 --> 00:17:32.153
The swamp will change you, I promise.

00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:35.223
Over the years, we've been so generous

00:17:35.247 --> 00:17:38.317
with these other landscapes
around the country,

00:17:38.341 --> 00:17:41.162
cloaking them with this American pride,

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.557
places that we now consider to define us:

00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:46.706
Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.139
And we use these parks
and these natural areas

00:17:49.163 --> 00:17:52.406
as beacons and as cultural compasses.

00:17:53.184 --> 00:17:55.229
And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly

00:17:55.253 --> 00:17:57.169
left out of that conversation.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.108
But I believe it's every bit
as iconic and emblematic

00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:02.005
of who we are as a country

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:04.530
as any of these other wildernesses.

00:18:04.554 --> 00:18:07.041
It's just a different kind of wild.

00:18:08.057 --> 00:18:09.384
But I'm encouraged,

00:18:09.408 --> 00:18:12.102
because maybe we're finally
starting to come around,

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:14.713
because what was once deemed
this swampy wasteland,

00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:16.800
today is a World Heritage site.

00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:20.158
It's a wetland
of international importance.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.502
And we've come a long way
in the last 60 years.

00:18:23.526 --> 00:18:27.920
And as the world's largest and most
ambitious wetland restoration project,

00:18:27.944 --> 00:18:32.285
the international spotlight
is on us in the Sunshine State.

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:34.042
Because if we can heal this system,

00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:37.515
it's going to become an icon
for wetland restoration

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:38.904
all over the world.

00:18:40.236 --> 00:18:44.782
But it's up to us to decide which legacy
we want to attach our flag to.

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:48.892
They say that the Everglades
is our greatest test.

00:18:49.984 --> 00:18:52.654
If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.968
I love that quote,

00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:57.025
because it's a challenge, it's a prod.

00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:58.928
Can we do it? Will we do it?

00:18:58.952 --> 00:19:00.691
We have to, we must.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.472
But the Everglades is not just a test.

00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:05.535
It's also a gift,

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:08.426
and ultimately, our responsibility.

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:10.110
Thank you.

00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:14.000
(Applause)
