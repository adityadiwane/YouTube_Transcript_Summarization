00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.356
I took a cell phone

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.036
and accidentally made myself famous.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.756
(Laughter)

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.396
I was just talking
about the things that I cared about,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.036
but with the click of a button

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.956
and an incendiary viral video

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.820
I propelled myself into overnight stardom.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.956
When I say overnight,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.036
I mean I literally woke up
the next morning

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.356
with so many notifications on my phone,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.836
I thought I slept
through a national tragedy.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.396
(Laughter)

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.556
It was the craziest thing, guys,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.916
but when it came to my influence
and my exposure,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180
I literally took a quantum leap.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.876
So I made more videos

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.316
and the subject matter of my videos

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.676
was often the most divisive subject
in American life,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.236
but it was the way that I articulated race

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.620
that made me somewhat
of a digital lightning rod.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.396
See, being a survivor myself
of police brutality

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.716
and having lost a childhood friend,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.316
Alonzo Ashley,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.116
at the hands of the police,

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.796
I had a little something
to say about the topic.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.196
You see, this was at the height
of the Black Lives Matter furor

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.476
and people seemed to be turning
to me to articulate their viewpoints,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.476
and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.156
You see, the internet
has this interesting quality.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.276
In one way, it totally
brought the world together,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.956
and I remember being a kid

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.156
and all of this utopian propaganda
was being dumped on us

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.996
about how the World Wide Web

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
was going to span the reaches
of people across the globe.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.476
But as it turns out, people are people.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.116
(Laughter)

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.996
And this magical superhighway

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.916
also took the demons of our nature

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.556
and gave them Ferraris.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.116
(Laughter)

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.836
You see, technology, y'all,
is a lot like money.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.436
It just brings out what's already
inside you and amplifies it.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.740
And so I soon became familiar
with the phenomenon of the internet troll.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.196
These guys seem to live
beneath the bridges

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.835
of said superhighway --

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.596
(Laughter)

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.820
And they also missed the memo about
the enlightenment of the internet age.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.636
I remember being called

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.476
highly colorful racial slurs

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.156
by those who use
the anonymity of the internet

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.860
as a Klan hood.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.620
And some of them
were pretty creative, actually,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.276
but others were pretty wounding,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.076
especially navigating
the post-traumatic world

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.596
of a police brutality survivor

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.756
in the height of Black Lives Matter,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.756
with all of these people
being killed on my timeline.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.956
To these trolls, I wasn't a human.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.396
I was an idea, an object,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.796
a caricature.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.996
Did I mention that this race stuff
can be kind of divisive?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.876
You see, I'm an innately curious person

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.796
and as I drew my sword to engage
in epic battles in the comment section --

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.140
(Laughter)

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.116
I also began to notice

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.596
that a few of my trolls
actually had brains,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.516
which made me even more curious
and what to understand them even further.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.556
And although these supposed morons

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.916
engaged in what appeared
to be original thought,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.796
I said to myself,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.516
"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.260
at least according to my knowledge."

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.356
Where are these guys
getting these arguments from?

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.716
Like, was there some kind
of alternative universe

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.996
with alternative facts?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.996
(Laughter)

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.980
(Applause)

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.636
Was history and gravity
optional over there?

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.860
I don't know.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.676
But I needed to know.
Like, I wanted to know.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.076
And as it turns out, I had no idea
about digital echo chambers.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.116
That same target marketing algorithm

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.796
that feeds you more
of the products you like to buy

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.916
also feeds you more
of the news that you like to hear.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.716
I had been living in an online universe

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.315
that just reflected
my worldview back to me.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.156
So my timeline was pretty liberal.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.036
I had no Breitbart
or Infowars or Fox News.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.500
No, no, I was all MSNBC
and The Daily Show,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.316
CNN and theGrio, right?

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.196
Well, these trolls were hopping
the dimensional doorway

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.276
and I needed to figure out how.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.580
(Laughter)

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.116
So what I decided to do

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.516
was trick the Facebook algorithm

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.876
into feeding me more news
that I didn't necessarily agree with,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.716
and this worked fine for a while,
but it wasn't enough,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.196
because my online footprint

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.116
already established the patterns
that I like to hear.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.756
So with the anonymity of the internet,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.996
I went undercover.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.356
(Laughter)

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.140
I set up this ghost profile
and went crazy.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.956
Now, on a practical level,
it was very simple,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.756
but on an emotional level,
it was kind of daunting,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.196
especially with the racist vitriol
that I had experienced.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.676
But what I didn't realize
is that my trolls were inoculating me,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.316
thickening my skin,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.156
making me immune to viewpoints
that I didn't necessarily agree with,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.556
and so I didn't react to the same things
as I would have several months prior.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.236
All right? So I pressed on.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.116
Noticing that this stuff
also worked on YouTube,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.156
I became Lucius25,
white supremacist lurker --

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.180
(Laughter)

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.340
And digitally I began to infiltrate
the infamous alt-right movement.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.836
Now, my doppelgÃ¤nger

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.516
was Edgar Rice Burroughs'
John Carter character --

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.196
(Laughter)

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.300
a sci-fi hero who was once
a Confederate soldier.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.636
And to think, like, years ago,
I would have needed acting training

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.556
and, like, makeup and a fake ID.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.020
Now I could just lurk.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.396
And so I started

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.396
with a little Infowars,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.876
went on into some American Renaissance,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.156
National Vanguard Alliance,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.036
and, you know, I started
commenting on videos,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.820
talking bad about Al Sharpton
and Black Lives Matter.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.020
I started bemoaning race baiters
like Eric Holder and Barack Obama

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.796
and just mirroring
the antiblack sentiments

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.476
that were thrown at me.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.236
And to be honest,
it was kind of exhilarating.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.316
(Laughter)

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.556
Like, I would literally spend days
clicking through my new racist profile --

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.756
(Laughter)

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.996
Goofing off at work in Aryan land.
It was something else.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.156
(Laughter)

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.556
And so I then started
visiting some of the pages

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.516
of my former trolls,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.316
and a lot of these guys
were just regular Joes,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.116
a lot of outdoorsmen,
hunters, computer nerds,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.276
some of them family guys
with videos of their families.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.920
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all
could be in this room right now. Right?

00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:43.236
(Laughter)

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.356
But when I went undercover,
I found a lovely plethora of characters,

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.396
luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos,
Richard Spencer and David Duke.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.756
All of these guys were
thought leaders in their own right,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.516
but over time, the alt-right movement
ended up using their information

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.196
to fuel their momentum.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.676
And I'm going to tell you what else
led to the momentum of the alt-right:

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:13.436
the left wing's wholesale demonization
of everything white and male.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.156
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver,
you're in league with Satan.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.180
(Laughter)

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.116
Now, would you believe,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.020
would you believe that some people
find that offensive?

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.436
And --

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.596
(Laughter)

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.356
And so, I mean, listen,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.836
the fact is that millennials
get a lifetime of diet brand history.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.316
I mean, America seems to be hellbent
on filling its textbooks

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.636
with CliffsNotes versions
of its dark past.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:55.955
This severely, severely decontextualizes
race and the anger associated with it,

00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:59.156
and that is fertile ground
for alt-facts to grow.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.196
Add in the wild landscape of the internet

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.516
and it's easy to sell
rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.260
to a generation who has been
failed by public schools.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.876
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.756
Alt-facts have that quality.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:20.116
However, one theme kept screaming at me
through the subtext of those arguments,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.036
and that was,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.060
why should I be hated
for who I cannot help but be?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.156
Now, as a black man in America,
that resonated with me.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.196
I have spent so much time

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.036
defending myself
against attempts to demonize me

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.396
and make me apologize for who I am,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.636
trying to portray me
as something that I'm not,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.220
some kind of thug or gangster,
a menace to society.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.620
Unexpected compassion.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.596
Wow.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.156
Now, listen,

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.756
the historical source of the demonization
of black males and white males

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.116
is highly different,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.636
and where you fall on this argument,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.020
sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.236
Now, you're probably surprised
by this perspective,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.460
and so was I.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.716
Never in a billion years did I think
that I could have some kind of compassion

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.300
for people who hated my guts.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.036
Now, mind you, not enough compassion
like I want to be friends.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.236
I don't have infinite olive branches
to extend to people

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.036
who, like, would not want
to see me on this planet. Right?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.836
But just enough compassion to understand
how they got to where they are.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.196
And to be honest,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.276
there were a couple of fair points.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.796
One of them was how liberals
have this wide acceptance for everybody

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.036
except for those with honestly held
conservative viewpoints.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.676
(Laughter)

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.140
Heaven forbid you love God,
this country and mean it. Right?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.156
And another thing that they talked about
was this fear that they had

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.276
of something that they labeled
as "white genocide,"

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.500
that diversity would be a force
that would wipe them out.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.396
Now listen, I know what it is to fear

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.036
for the fate of your people.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.996
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.196
mass incarceration,
gentrification, police shootings,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.180
black people have more
than enough reasons to stay up at night.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.636
But if nature is into diversity
and you are not,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.956
you're going to lose that fight, buddy.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.796
(Laughter)

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.940
(Applause)

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.236
You see, nature doesn't care
about your race. That's man-made.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.316
Nature just cares about healthy organisms,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.620
and your precious ethnic features
are expendable to that aim.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.876
So the moment that you let go
of that racist identity

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.716
and relatch onto humanity,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.276
all your problems go away.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.180
(Applause)

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.876
I'm going to tell you
what race ain't about to die out:

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.116
the human race.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.780
Join the party. The water's great.

00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:02.236
Until the water gets too hot,
but that's another TED Talk.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.020
(Laughter)

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.636
The point is that to get
to this point of understanding,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.436
you have to let go of that fear

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.156
and embrace your curiosity,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.636
and sadly, too many people
will not take that journey

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.676
to see the world from the other side.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.276
And, I mean, let's be honest,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.436
that doesn't just go for progressives,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.716
but also to the right wing
and conservatives.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.956
You know, as fair
as some of their points were,

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.396
they were still trapped
in their own echo chambers,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.796
recycling old, outdated points of view,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.356
never getting a diversity in perspective,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.116
not making them well-rounded
in their worldview.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.956
So they're not hearing
certain anti-racist and political voices,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.956
voices like Tim Wise

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.436
and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy,
Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.396
All of these voices have the answers
to the questions that they want,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.236
but unfortunately they will not hear them
due to the power of these echo chambers.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.916
We have got to break out
of these digital divides,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.556
because as our technology advances,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.076
the consequences of our tribalism
become more dangerous.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.716
And this whole experience
taught me something:

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.580
our gadgets ain't going to save us.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.156
All these technological devices

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.876
are only mastery of the universe
out there, not the one in here.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.156
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.996
That's a dangerous imbalance.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.836
Where do you get
the emotional intelligence,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.716
the character development,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.436
the virtues of patience,
forbearance, compassion,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.636
you know, the things that make sure
that these devices, however advanced,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.580
become a blessing and not a curse?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.340
Seems to be me that humanity itself
needs an upgrade.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.756
Now --

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.636
(Applause)

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.316
That's a big task, understandably,

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.076
but I don't believe
in any kind of unbeatable monster.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.356
There was no giant out there
without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.716
And what if I told you

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.516
that one of the best ways
to actually overcome this

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.756
is to have courageous conversations

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.996
with difficult people,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.436
people who do not see the world
the same way that you see the world?

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.316
Oh yes, folks, conversations may be
indeed the key to that upgrade,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.876
because remember,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.916
language was the first form
of virtual reality.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.036
It is literally a symbolic representation
of the physical world,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.116
and through this device,
we change the physical world.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.276
Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.436
conversations start countries,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.716
they build bridges,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.276
and when the chips are down,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.956
conversations are the last tools
that humans use

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.460
before they pick up their guns.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.916
And I ain't talking
about online safe conversations

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.556
from the security of your laptop.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.996
No.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.716
I'm talking about in-your-face
conversations with real, breathing people.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.956
And for me, this looks
like running a community forum

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.876
called Shop Talk Live.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.500
Now, in Shop Talk Live --
somebody's been there, right?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.436
In Shop Talk Live,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.916
we have the conversations
that change lives.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.716
We meet the community
right where they are,

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.156
and we've done everything
from divert gang violence in real time

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.836
to help find people jobs

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.996
to mentoring homeless youth.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.916
And the reason why we needed to do this

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.036
is because there was a severe lack
of trust in the black community

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.236
due to the violence of the crack era.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.516
And so we ended up taking
agency into our own hands,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.076
solving our own problems,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.156
not waiting for anybody else.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.396
And the truth is,

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.796
from the mayor to the felon,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.996
you're going to find them
in that barber shop.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.036
And so what we did was just
organize what was already going on.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.796
And so what I started doing
was mining these alternative viewpoints

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.116
from these alternative digital universes,

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.676
dissecting them, breaking them down
into controversial talking points.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.276
Then, with my cell phone,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.356
I flipped the internet against itself

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.116
and began to broadcast
these live conversations

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.836
to my online followers.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.876
This made them want to leave
the safety of their laptops

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.236
and meet us in person
to have real conversations

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.060
with real people in real life.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.996
And we did this. Thank you.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.700
(Applause)

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.476
Sometimes I sit back,
and I reflect on the paradox

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.716
of me just trying to solve the problems,

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.756
us trying to solve the problems
in our own communities --

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.156
we build bridges
to so many other communities,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.796
from the LGBTQ community
to the Arab immigrant community

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.756
and even sat down with somebody
with a Confederate flag on their hat

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.476
and talked about the things
that actually matter.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.236
It is time that we stop trying

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.596
to hack our way
around the human experience.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.676
There is no way out of each other.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.036
Stop trying to find one.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.356
(Applause)

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.076
We have to understand something.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.236
Human beings all want the same things

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.956
and we have to go through
each other to get these things.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.636
These courageous conversations
are the way that these bridges are built.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.196
It's time that we start
seeing people as people

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.156
and not simply the ideas
that we project onto them or react to.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.876
Human beings are not the barriers

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:20.220
but the gateways
to the very things that we want.

00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:23.580
This is a collective
and conscious evolution.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.515
My journey began with
a terribly popular cell phone video

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.235
and a fallen friend.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.980
Your journey begins right about now.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.235
Join the renaissance in human connection.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.995
It is going to happen with or without you.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.916
My suggestion: pick a topic,
and start a community dialogue

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.756
in your neck of the woods.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.556
Meet folks back in real life.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.116
And I'm going to tell you,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.516
when you trick the algorithm
of your existence,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.980
you will get some diversified experiences.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.476
It is time to grow, people.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.436
And when we do this, not if,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.996
it will be clear
that the key to this upgrade

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.956
was always our inner world,
not some device that we create,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.276
and the doorways
to this experience is now,

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.076
and will forever be, each other.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.876
Thank you.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.900
(Applause)
