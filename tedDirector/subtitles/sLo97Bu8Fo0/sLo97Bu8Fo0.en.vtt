00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.659
Talking about empowerment is odd,

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.761
because when we talk about empowerment,

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.967
what affects us most are the stories.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.179
So I want to begin with an everyday story.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.702
What is it really like to be a young woman in India?

00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:30.974
Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:33.073
in India, lived in three small towns,

00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:34.889
two major cities,

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:38.118
and I've had several experiences.

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:39.974
When I was seven,

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:41.931
a private tutor who used to come home

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.646
to teach me mathematics molested me.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.363
He would put his hand up my skirt.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.970
He put his hand up my skirt and told me

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.930
he knew how to make me feel good.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.060
At 17, a boy from my high school

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.507
circulated an email

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:06.940
detailing all the sexually aggressive things

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.704
he could do to me

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:13.789
because I didn't pay attention to him.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.500
At 19, I helped a friend

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.592
whose parents had forcefully
married her to an older man

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:24.259
escape an abusive marriage.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.401
At 21, when my friend and I were walking

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.734
down the road one afternoon,

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.273
a man pulled down his pants

00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:35.483
and masturbated in front of us.

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:39.910
We called people for help, and nobody came.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.900
At 25, when I was walking home one evening,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.726
two men on a motorcycle attacked me.

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:49.843
I spent two nights in the hospital

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:53.085
recovering from trauma and injuries.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:58.305
So throughout my life, I've seen women —

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.171
family, friends, colleagues —

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.964
live through these experiences,

00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:06.137
and they seldom talk about it.

00:02:06.137 --> 00:02:10.777
So in simple words, life in India is not easy.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:14.295
But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:16.049
I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.427
of learning that this fear took me on.

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:23.930
So, what happened one night in December 2012

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.704
changed my life.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:29.000
So a young girl, a 23-year-old student,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.904
boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.513
There were six men on the bus, young men

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:39.591
who you might encounter every day in India,

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.923
and the chilling account of what followed

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.667
was played over and over again

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.491
in the Indian and international media.

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:49.765
This girl was raped repeatedly,

00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.745
forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.996
beaten, bitten, and left to die.

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:58.000
Her friend was gagged, attacked,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.577
and knocked unconscious.

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:05.761
She died on the 29th of December.

00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:07.739
And at a time when most of us here

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.242
were preparing to welcome the new year,

00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:13.479
India plunged into darkness.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.645
For the first time in our history,

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:18.823
men and women in Indian cities

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.014
woke up to the horrific truth

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:24.536
about the true state of women in the country.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.955
Now, like many other young women,

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.149
I was absolutely terrified.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:30.416
I couldn't believe that something like this

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:33.591
could happen in a national capital.

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.144
I was angry and I was frustrated,

00:03:36.144 --> 00:03:40.247
but most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:42.388
But really, what do you do, right?

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.413
Some write blogs, some ignore it,

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:46.145
some join protests.

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.710
I did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.388
two years ago.

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:53.367
So the media was filled with stories about

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.133
all the horrific deeds

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.237
that Indian men are capable of.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.472
They were compared to animals,

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.659
sexually repressed beasts.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.663
In fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event

00:04:04.663 --> 00:04:05.977
in an Indian mind

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:08.393
that the response from the Indian media,

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:12.300
public and politicians proved one point:

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.179
No one knew what to do.

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:16.776
And no one wanted to be responsible for it.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:19.260
In fact, these were a few insensitive comments

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.441
which were made in the media

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.468
by prominent people

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:26.624
in response to sexual violence
against women in general.

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:29.826
So the first one is made by a member of parliament,

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:33.219
the second one is made by a spiritual leader,

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.930
and the third one was actually
the defendants' lawyer

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.776
when the girl was fighting for her life

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:40.630
and she passed away.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.483
Now, as a woman watching this day after day,

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:46.283
I was tired.

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:47.927
So as a writer and gender activist,

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:51.176
I have written extensively on women,

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:53.822
but this time, I realized it was different,

00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:55.403
because a part of me realized

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.751
I was a part of that young woman too,

00:04:57.751 --> 00:04:59.929
and I decided I wanted to change this.

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:03.960
So I did something spontaneous, hasty.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.506
I logged on to a citizen journalism platform

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.962
called iReport,

00:05:07.962 --> 00:05:10.713
and I recorded a video talking about

00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:12.693
what the scene was like in Bangalore.

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:14.380
I talked about how I felt,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.722
I talked about the ground realities,

00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:21.227
and I talked about the frustrations of living in India.

00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:24.845
In a few hours, the blog was shared widely,

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:26.680
and comments and thoughts poured in

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.340
from across the world.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.015
In that moment, a few things occurred to me.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:35.743
One, technology was always at hand

00:05:35.743 --> 00:05:38.960
for many young women like me.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.504
Two, like me, most young women

00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:45.925
hardly use it to express their views.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:49.849
Three, I realized for the first time

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.707
that my voice mattered.

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:55.440
So in the months that followed,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.487
I covered a trail of events in Bangalore

00:05:57.487 --> 00:06:01.469
which had no space in the mainstream news.

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.240
In Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.840
I gathered with over 100 others

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.749
when groups of young men came forward

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.561
to wear skirts to prove that clothing

00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.241
does not invite rape.

00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:15.075
When I reported about these events,

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:18.168
I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel

00:06:18.168 --> 00:06:22.337
to release all the emotions I had inside me.

00:06:22.337 --> 00:06:24.409
I attended the town hall march

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.343
when students held up signs saying

00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:28.872
"Kill them, hang them."

00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:32.699
"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.177
I went to a candlelight vigil

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.280
where citizens gathered together

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.237
to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,

00:06:40.237 --> 00:06:42.277
and I recorded a lot of blogs

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.980
in response to how worrying the situation was

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.249
in India at that point.

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.898
["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"]

00:06:47.898 --> 00:06:49.357
Now, the reactions confused me.

00:06:49.357 --> 00:06:52.227
While supportive comments poured
in from across the world,

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:54.241
as did vicious ones.

00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:55.675
So some called me a hypocrite.

00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:58.438
Some called me a victim, a rape apologist.

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.403
Some even said I had a political motive.

00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:03.523
But this one comment kind of describes

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:08.330
what we are discussing here today.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.440
But I was soon to learn that this was not all.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.429
As empowered as I felt

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:14.879
with the new liberty that this

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.236
citizen journalism channel gave me,

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:20.570
I found myself in an unfamiliar situation.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.737
So sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook

00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:25.140
and I was looking through my news feed,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.183
and I noticed there was a link

00:07:27.183 --> 00:07:28.856
that was being shared by my friends.

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:31.039
I clicked on the link; it led me back

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.114
to a report uploaded by an American girl

00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:37.322
called Michaela Cross.

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:38.710
The report was titled,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.951
"India: The story you never wanted to hear."

00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.096
And in this report, she recounted her firsthand

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:48.796
account of facing sexual harassment in India.

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:52.763
She wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.850
the eyes that every day stared

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.574
with such entitlement at my body,

00:07:57.574 --> 00:07:59.424
with no change of expression

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:02.072
whether I met their gaze or not.

00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:05.210
Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.309
I got stares so sharp

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:10.746
that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:14.640
She called India a traveler's
heaven and a woman's hell.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.656
She said she was stalked, groped,

00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:18.253
and masturbated at.

00:08:18.253 --> 00:08:20.692
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.

00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:24.304
It was on news channels across the world.

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:25.910
Everyone was discussing it.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.018
It had over a million views,

00:08:27.018 --> 00:08:28.923
a thousand comments and shares,

00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:30.837
and I found myself witnessing

00:08:30.837 --> 00:08:33.401
a very similar thing.

00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.097
The media was caught in this vicious cycle

00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:38.395
of opinion and outburst

00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:41.700
and no outcome whatsoever.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.105
So that night, as I sat wondering

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:45.437
how I should respond,

00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:47.847
I found myself filled with doubt.

00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:51.208
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:53.586
as an observer,

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:57.964
as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:02.443
and as an activist, I looked
at it as a defender of rights,

00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.578
but as a citizen journalist,

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.852
I suddenly felt very vulnerable.

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:10.183
I mean, here she was, a young woman

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:11.583
who was using a channel to talk about

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.721
her experience just as I was,

00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:16.545
and yet I felt unsettled.

00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:18.467
You see, no one ever tells you

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:21.407
that true empowerment comes from giving yourself

00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:23.783
the permission to think and act.

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:26.245
Empowerment is often made to sound as if

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:29.442
it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.

00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:31.274
When we talk about empowerment, we often

00:09:31.274 --> 00:09:34.559
talk about giving people access to materials,

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.295
giving them access to tools.

00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:39.744
But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.

00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:41.206
It's a feeling.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.938
The first step to empowerment

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:46.818
is to give yourself the authority,

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.793
the key to independent will,

00:09:48.793 --> 00:09:50.393
and for women everywhere,

00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:52.941
no matter who we are or where we come from,

00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:56.261
that is the most difficult step.

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:58.870
We fear the sound of our own voice,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.656
for it means admission, but it is this that gives us

00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:04.740
the power to change our environment.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.581
Now in this situation where I was faced

00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:09.267
with so many different kinds of realities,

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:10.753
I was unsure how to judge,

00:10:10.753 --> 00:10:13.838
because I didn't know what it would mean for me.

00:10:13.838 --> 00:10:16.843
I feared to judge because I
didn't know what it would be

00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:20.124
if I didn't support the same view as this girl.

00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:21.490
I didn't know what it would mean for me

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:26.370
if I was challenging someone else's truth.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.863
But yet, it was simple.

00:10:27.863 --> 00:10:29.312
I had to make a decision:

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:32.502
Should I speak up or should I stay quiet?

00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:34.786
So after a lot of thought,

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:37.282
I recorded a video blog in response,

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.252
and I told Michaela, well,

00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:41.955
there are different sides to India,

00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:47.364
and I also tried to explain

00:10:47.364 --> 00:10:49.425
that things would be okay

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:52.091
and I expressed my regret for what she had faced.

00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:54.692
And a few days later, I was invited to talk

00:10:54.692 --> 00:10:56.061
on air with her,

00:10:56.061 --> 00:11:00.181
and for the first time, I reached out to this girl

00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:02.982
who I had never met, who was so far away,

00:11:02.982 --> 00:11:05.820
but yet I felt so close to.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.350
Since this report came to light,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.655
more young people than ever

00:11:10.655 --> 00:11:14.006
were discussing sexual harassment on the campus,

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.797
and the university that Michaela belonged to

00:11:16.797 --> 00:11:20.645
gave her the assistance she needed.

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:22.990
The university even took measures

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.049
to train its students to equip them

00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:26.685
with the skills that they need

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:30.155
to confront challenges such as harassment,

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:34.448
and for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.

00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:36.534
You see, if there's anything that I've learned

00:11:36.534 --> 00:11:39.169
as an active citizen journalist

00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:42.252
over the past few years,

00:11:42.252 --> 00:11:46.225
it is our dire lack as a society to actively find

00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:49.222
avenues where our voices can be heard.

00:11:49.222 --> 00:11:53.526
We don't realize that when we are standing up,

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:55.368
we are not just standing up as individuals,

00:11:55.368 --> 00:11:58.605
we are standing up for our communities,

00:11:58.605 --> 00:12:00.464
our friends, our peers.

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:03.837
Most of us say that women are denied their rights,

00:12:03.837 --> 00:12:06.213
but the truth is, oftentimes,

00:12:06.213 --> 00:12:09.613
women deny themselves these rights.

00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:12.250
In a recent survey in India,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.781
95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,

00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:20.197
aviation, hospitality and call centers,

00:12:20.197 --> 00:12:22.764
said they didn't feel safe returning home alone

00:12:22.764 --> 00:12:26.150
after work in the late hours or in the evening.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.551
In Bangalore, where I come from,

00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:30.017
this number is 85 percent.

00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:32.563
In rural areas in India,

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:35.720
if anything is to go by the recent

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.287
gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha

00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:40.308
and Aligarh are supposed to go by,

00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:43.885
we need to act really soon.

00:12:43.885 --> 00:12:45.578
Don't get me wrong,

00:12:45.578 --> 00:12:48.285
the challenges that women will face

00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:51.077
in telling their stories is real,

00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:53.782
but we need to start pursuing

00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:56.269
and trying to identify mediums

00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:57.760
to participate in our system

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.124
and not just pursue the media blindly.

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:05.122
Today, more women than ever

00:13:05.122 --> 00:13:06.767
are standing up and questioning

00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:08.146
the government in India,

00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:11.169
and this is a result of that courage.

00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:14.222
There is a sixfold increase in women

00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:15.784
reporting harassment,

00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:17.173
and the government passed

00:13:17.173 --> 00:13:20.149
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:23.968
to protect women against sexual assault.

00:13:23.968 --> 00:13:25.920
As I end this talk,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.040
I just want to say

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.620
that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.572
but let us speak up.

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:38.241
Let us fight the shame and talk about it.

00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:41.761
It could be a platform, a community,

00:13:41.761 --> 00:13:45.648
your loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,

00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:47.740
but let us speak up.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.800
The truth is, the end to this problem

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.542
begins with us.

00:13:52.542 --> 00:13:54.187
Thank you.

00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:57.748
(Applause)
