00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I've been spending a lot of time

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
traveling around the world these days,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
talking to groups of students and professionals,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
On the one hand, people say,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
"The time for change is now."

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
They want to be part of it.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
But on the other hand,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I hear people talking about fear,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
a sense of risk-aversion.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
but I don't know where to start.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I work in global poverty.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And they say, "I want to work in global poverty,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
but what will it mean about my career?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Will I be marginalized?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Will I not make enough money?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Will I never get married or have children?"

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and I'm glad I waited --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
(Laughter)

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
-- and has no children,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I look at these young people

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Your job is only to be human.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And nothing important happens in life

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
without a cost."

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
These conversations really reflect what's happening

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
at the national and international level.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Our leaders and ourselves

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
want everything,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
but we don't talk about the costs.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
We don't talk about the sacrifice.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
One of my favorite quotes from literature

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
was written by Tillie Olsen,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
the great American writer from the South.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
In a short story called "Oh Yes,"

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
she talks about a white woman in the 1950s

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
who has a daughter

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
who befriends a little African American girl,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and she looks at her child with a sense of pride,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
but she also wonders,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
what price will she pay?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
"Better immersion

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
than to live untouched."

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
But the real question is,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
what is the cost of not daring?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
What is the cost of not trying?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I've been so privileged in my life

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to know extraordinary leaders

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
who have chosen to live lives of immersion.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
One woman I knew who was a fellow

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
was named Ingrid Washinawatok.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
a Native American peoples.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And when we would gather as fellows,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
she would push us to think about

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
how the elders in Native American culture

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
make decisions.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And she said they would literally visualize

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
the faces of children

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
for seven generations into the future,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
looking at them from the Earth,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and they would look at them, holding them as stewards

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
for that future.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
not only as human beings,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
but to every living thing on the planet.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And tragically, in 1999,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
when she was in Colombia

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
working with the U'wa people,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
focused on preserving their culture and language,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
she and two colleagues were abducted

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and tortured and killed by the FARC.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And more than a decade later,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
when I talk to NGO fellows,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and we talk about Ingrid,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and her spirit

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and really build on the unfulfilled work

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
of her life's mission.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And when we think about legacy,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I can think of no more powerful one,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
despite how short her life was.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And I've been touched by Cambodian women --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
beautiful women,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And I met them in the early '90s.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
the artists, the dancers.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And at the end of the war,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And the women, who I was so privileged to meet

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
when there were three survivors,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
told these stories about lying in their cots

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
in the refugee camps.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
They said they would try so hard

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to remember the fragments of the dance,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
hoping that others were alive and doing the same.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
her hands at her side,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and she talked about

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
the reunion of the 30 after the war

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and how extraordinary it was.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And these big tears fell down her face,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
but she never lifted her hands to move them.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And the women decided that they would train

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
but the next generation.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And I sat there in the studio

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
watching these women clapping their hands --

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
beautiful rhythms --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
as these little fairy pixies

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
were dancing around them,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
wearing these beautiful silk colors.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And I thought, after all this atrocity,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
this is how human beings really pray.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Because they're focused on honoring

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
what is most beautiful about our past

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and building it into

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the promise of our future.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And what these women understood

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
is sometimes the most important things that we do

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and that we spend our time on

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
are those things that we cannot measure.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I also have been touched

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
by the dark side of power and leadership.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And I have learned that power,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
particularly in its absolute form,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
is an equal opportunity provider.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
to start that country's first microfinance bank.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And one of the women was Agnes --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
there on your extreme left --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
she was one of the first three

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
women parliamentarians in Rwanda,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
and her legacy should have been

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
We built this institution based on social justice,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
gender equity,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
this idea of empowering women.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
than she did principle at the end.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And though she had been part of building a liberal party,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
a political party

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that was focused on diversity and tolerance,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
about three months before the genocide, she switched parties

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and she became the Minister of Justice

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
under the genocide regime

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and was known for inciting men to kill faster

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and stop behaving like women.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
She was convicted

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of category one crimes of genocide.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And I would visit her in the prisons,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
sitting side-by-side, knees touching,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and I would have to admit to myself

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that monsters exist in all of us,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but that maybe it's not monsters so much,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
but the broken parts of ourselves,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
sadnesses, secret shame,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
to prey on those parts,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
those fragments, if you will,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and to make us look at other beings, human beings,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
as lesser than ourselves --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and in the extreme, to do terrible things.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And there is no group

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
than young men.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
is the adolescent male.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And so in a gathering

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
where we're focused on women,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
while it is so critical that we invest in our girls

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and we even the playing field

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and we find ways to honor them,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
we have to remember that the girls and the women

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
are most isolated and violated

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and victimized and made invisible

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
in those very societies

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
where our men and our boys

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
feel disempowered,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
unable to provide.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And that, when they sit on those street corners

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and all they can think of in the future

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is no job, no education,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
no possibility,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
well then it's easy to understand

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
how the greatest source of status

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
can come from a uniform

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and a gun.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Sometimes very small investments

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
can release enormous, infinite potential

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that exists in all of us.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Suraj Sudhakar,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
has what we call moral imagination --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and lead from that perspective.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And he's been working with this young group of men

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And they're incredible guys.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And together they started a book club

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
for a hundred people in the slums,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and they're reading many TED authors and liking it.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And then they created a business plan competition.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And I have learned so much

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
from Chris and Kevin

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and Alex and Herbert

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and all of these young men.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Alex, in some ways, said it best.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
He said, "We used to feel like nobodies,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
but now we feel like somebodies."

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And I think we have it all wrong

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
when we think that income is the link.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
What we really yearn for as human beings

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is to be visible to each other.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
And the reason these young guys

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
told me that they're doing these TEDx's

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
is because they were sick and tired

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
of the only workshops coming to the slums

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
being those workshops focused on HIV,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
or at best, microfinance.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And they wanted to celebrate

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
the photojournalists and the creatives,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And they're doing it.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And my hat's off to you in Kibera.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
My own work focuses

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
on making philanthropy more effective

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and capitalism more inclusive.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and we invest what we call patient capital --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
not as passive recipients of charity,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
but as full-bodied agents of change

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
who want to solve their own problems

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and make their own decisions.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that focus on change.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
I know it works.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
into these forgotten markets.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
like maternal health care and housing,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
emergency services, solar energy,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
so that people can have more dignity

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
in solving their problems.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Patient capital is uncomfortable

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
for people searching for simple solutions,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
easy categories,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
But we find those entrepreneurs

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
who put people and the planet

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
before profit.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
that is about measuring impact,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
measuring what is most important to us.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And my dream is we'll have a world one day

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
where we don't just honor those who take money

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
and make more money from it,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
but we find those individuals who take our resources

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and convert it into changing the world

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
in the most positive ways.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And it's only when we honor them

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and celebrate them and give them status

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
that the world will really change.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
where I saw two visions of the world

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
living side-by-side --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
one based on violence

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
and the other on transcendence.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
on the day that two mosques were attacked

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
by suicide bombers.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And the reason these mosques were attacked

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
is because the people praying inside

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
were from a particular sect of Islam

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And not only did those suicide bombers

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
take a hundred lives,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
but they did more,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and certainly despair.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
But less than 24 hours,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
I was 13 miles away from those mosques,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
visiting one of our Acumen investees,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
an incredible man, Jawad Aslam,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
who dares to live a life of immersion.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Born and raised in Baltimore,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
named Tasneem Saddiqui.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
on this barren piece of land

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
using patient capital,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
but he continued to pay a price.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
He stood on moral ground

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
and refused to pay bribes.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
It took almost two years just to register the land.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
from one person's action.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
in this beautiful community.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And there's schools and clinics and shops.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
But there's only one mosque.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And so I asked Jawad,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
He said, "Long story.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
It was hard, it was a difficult road,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
but ultimately the leaders of the community came together,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
realizing we only have each other.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And we decided that we would elect

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
the three most respected imams,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and those imams would take turns,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
But the whole community,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
would sit together and pray."

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
in our worlds.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
We face huge issues as a world --

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
the financial crisis,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
global warming

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and this growing sense of fear and otherness.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And every day we have a choice.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
We can take the easier road,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
the more cynical road,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
which is a road based on

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
sometimes dreams of a past that never really was,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
a fear of each other,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
distancing and blame.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Or we can take the much more difficult path

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
of transformation, transcendence,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
compassion and love,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
but also accountability and justice.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
I had the great honor

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
who stood up for change

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
And he tells this incredible story

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
the first child to desegregate schools in the South --

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
in this case, New Orleans.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And he said that every day

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
would walk with real grace

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
through a phalanx of white people

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
screaming angrily, calling her a monster,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
threatening to poison her --

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
distorted faces.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
And every day he would watch her,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
and it looked like she was talking to the people.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And she'd say, "I'm not talking."

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
What are you saying?"

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
I'm praying."

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?"

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
for they know not what they are doing.'"

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
At age six,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
this child was living a life of immersion,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
and her family paid a price for it.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
But she became part of history

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and opened up this idea

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
that all of us should have access to education.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
My final story is about a young, beautiful man

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
named Josephat Byaruhanga,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
who was another Acumen Fund fellow,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
who hails from Uganda, a farming community.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
just 200 miles away.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And he said to me at the end of his year,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
because I thought as a farmer and as an African

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
I would understand how to transcend culture.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
But especially when I was talking to the African women,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
I sometimes made these mistakes --

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
leadership is like a panicle of rice.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Because at the height of the season,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
at the height of its powers,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
it reaches to the heavens."

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And he said, "But right before the harvest,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
it bends over

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
with great gratitude and humility

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
to touch the earth from where it came."

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
We need leaders.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
We ourselves need to lead

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
from a place that has the audacity

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
to believe we can, ourselves,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
extend the fundamental assumption

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
that all men are created equal

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
to every man, woman and child on this planet.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
And we need to have the humility to recognize

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
that we cannot do it alone.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Robert Kennedy once said

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
but each of us can work

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
to change a small portion of events."

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
And it is in the total of all those acts

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
that the history of this generation will be written.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Our lives are so short,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
and our time on this planet

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
is so precious,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
and all we have is each other.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
So may each of you

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
live lives of immersion.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
They won't necessarily be easy lives,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.260
but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
Thank you.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:39.260
(Applause)
