00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A fact

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
came out of MIT,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
couple of years ago. Ken Hale,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who's a linguist,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
said that of the 6,000 languages

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
spoken on Earth right now,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
3,000 aren't spoken by the children.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So that in one generation,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we're going to halve our cultural diversity.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He went on to say

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that every two weeks,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
an elder goes to the grave

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
carrying the last spoken word

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of that culture.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So an entire philosophy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a body of knowledge about the natural world

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
goes away.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And this happens every two weeks.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So for the last 20 years,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
since my dental experience,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have been traveling the world

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and coming back

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
with stories about some of these people.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What I'd like to do right now

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is share some of those stories with you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is Tamdin.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
She is a 69-year-old nun.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for putting up a little tiny placard

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
protesting the occupation of her country.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And when I met her, she had just

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
taken a walk over the Himalayas

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
into Nepal, across to India --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
30 days --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So I took this picture three days

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
after she arrived,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
with her toes sticking out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And she crossed in March,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This is Paldin.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And he spent 33 years in prison.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
His whole monastery was thrown into prison

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at the time of the uprising,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
when the Dalai Lama had to leave

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Tibet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
he was beaten, starved,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And it really impressed me --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that he went through that experience, and ended up

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
with the demeanor that he had.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and I'd spent about five weeks there,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and I was hearing these similar stories

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
into Dharamsala.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And it just so happened, on the fifth week,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
many of which I had just interviewed,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and heard their stories,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and I watched their faces,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and they gave us a little FM radio,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And what he said was:

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
because it's your enemies

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that build your tolerance and patience

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
on the road to your enlightenment.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That hit me so hard,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
telling these people that had been through this experience.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So, two months later, I went into

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Tibet, and I started

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I interview and do portraits.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And this is a little girl.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I'd snuck in --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it's the quickest way you can get arrested.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and I would hand them out.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And when I gave them to the people,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
they'd either hold them to their heart,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And this is --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
way in the western part of the country.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is at 17,000 feet.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And they had just come down from the high pastures,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
at 18,000 feet.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Same thing: gave her a picture,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
she held it up to her forehead.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I usually hand out Polaroids

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and checking my lights,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This is Tenzin Gyatso;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
out in a peasant's house,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
way out in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
At the age of four, he was installed

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
as the 14th Dalai Lama.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
As a teenager, he faced

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the invasion of his country,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to kill him,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
they dressed him up like a beggar

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and snuck him out of the country on horseback,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and took the same trip that Tamdin did.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And he's never been back to his country since.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
if you think about this man,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
46 years later,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
still sticking

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to this non-violent response

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to a severe political and human rights issue.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And the young people,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know, violence as a political tool

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is all the rage right now.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
he still is holding this line.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So this is our icon

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to non-violence in our world --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
one of our living icons.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This is another leader of his people.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And Moi is 35 years old.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
oil was discovered in 1972.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And in this period of time -- since that time --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
as much oil, or twice as much oil

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And Moi

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
belongs to the Huaorani tribe,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and they're known as

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
very fierce, they're known as "auca."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And they've managed to keep out

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
the seismologists and the oil workers

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
with spears and blowguns.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And we spent --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I was with a team --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
two weeks with these guys out in the jungle

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
watching them hunt.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This was on a monkey hunt,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
hunting with curare-tipped darts.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And the knowledge that these people have

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
about the natural environment is incredible.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I couldn't even see the monkeys

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that they were

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
getting with these darts.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This is Yadira,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and Yadira is

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
five years old. She's in a

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And her tribe has had to move

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And we never hear about that. And the latest

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
infraction against these people is,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
as part of Plan Colombia,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
we're defoliating thousands of acres

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
of the Ecuadorian Amazon

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in our war on drugs.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This is Mengatoue.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He's the shaman of the Huaorani,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
of spearing these oil workers.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I wish they would just go away.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And I was -- I usually travel alone

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
when I do my work, but I did this --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I hosted a program for Discovery,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and when I went down with the team,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I was quite concerned about

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
deep into the Huaorani tribe.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
as it turned out, these guys really

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
taught me a thing or two about blending in

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
with the locals.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Laughter)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
One of the things I did

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
just before 9/11 --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
August of 2001 --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I took my son, Dax,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
who was 16 at the time,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and I took him to Pakistan.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because at first I wanted --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but I wanted him to see

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
people that live on a dollar a day or less.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I wanted him to get an experience

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
in the Islamic world

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and I also wanted him to --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I was going there to work with a group,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
do a story on a group called the Kalash,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that live -- very small area --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
drumming and dancing.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And he brought a soccer ball,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and we had soccer every night in this little village.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And then we went up

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and met their shaman.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
of his tribe as well.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And this is John Doolikahn,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
who's the shaman of the Kalash.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And he's up in the mountains,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
right on the border with Afghanistan.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
the area where

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And we watched

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and stayed with

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
John Doolikahn.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
which is

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
an interesting phenomenon.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But around the world,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
they go into trance in different ways,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and in Pakistan,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and they sacrifice an animal,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
pour the blood of the animal on the leaves

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and then inhale the smoke.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And they're all praying

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to the mountain gods

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
as they go into trance.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
You know,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
getting kids used to different realities,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
having a curriculum where they study different religions,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
just to make a mental flexibility,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
give them a mental flexibility

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in different belief systems --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I think this is so necessary in our world today

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And all the security issues they cause us.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So, one thing we did five years ago:

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we started a program that links kids

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So we first hooked up

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We now have 15 sites.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and one-third animist, the community is --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Ollantaytambo, Peru,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and Arctic Village, Alaska.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
This is Daniel; he's one of our students

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
in Arctic Village, Alaska.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
He lives in this log cabin --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
no running water, no heat other than --

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
no windows

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and high-speed Internet connection.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And this is --

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I see this rolling out all over --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
where they first saw their first computers;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
now they have computers in their classrooms.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And the way we've done this --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we teach digital storytelling to these kids.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in their community that they care about.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
about a river that they cleaned up.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and we bring people who want to learn

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
digital workflow and storytelling,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and have them

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
work with the kids.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and this has worked the best.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So our dream is to bring teenagers together,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
so they'll have a community service experience

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
as well as a cross-cultural experience,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
as they teach kids in these areas

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and help them build their communication infrastructure.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is teaching Photoshop

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that these kids have made,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and they're quite incredible.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The one I want to show you --

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
after we get them to make the movies,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
we have a night where we show the movies to the community.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And this is in Takaungu --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
we've got a generator and a digital projector,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and we're projecting it up against a barn,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and showing one of the movies that they made.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the incredible work these kids do.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The other thing:

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
That was one of the big motivating factors.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But the other motivating factor is

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the insular nature of our country.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
National Geographic just did a Roper Study

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
of 18 to 26 year olds

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
in our country

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and in nine other industrialized countries.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It was a two million dollar study.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
United States came in second to last

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
in geographic knowledge.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
70 percent of the kids couldn't find

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
60 percent couldn't find India;

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And this is a study

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
that was just done a couple of years ago.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So what I'd like to show you now,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
in the couple of minutes I have left,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
is a film that a student made in Guatemala.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We just had a workshop in Guatemala.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
A week before we got to the workshop,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
last October, came in and buried

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
600 people alive in their village.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And this kid lived in the village --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
he wasn't there at the time --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and this is the little movie he put together about that.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And he hadn't seen a computer before

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
yeah, we can play it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is an old Mayan funeral chant

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
that he got from his grandfather.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
(Applause)
