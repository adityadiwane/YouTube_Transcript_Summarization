00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I was informed by this kind of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
unoriginal and trite idea

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that new technologies were an opportunity

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
for social transformation,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
which is what drove me then,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
but it's still the same theme song --

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and introduce you to my lab and current work,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
which is the Environmental Health Clinic

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that I run at NYU.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is redefine what counts as health.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
except people come to the clinic

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
with environmental health concerns,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and they walk out with prescriptions

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for things they can do to improve environmental health,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
But that suggests the issue

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
that I'm trying to get at here,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Because this idea that health is internal

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and atomized and individual

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and pharmaceutical

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
is largely an error.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And I would use this study,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
a recent study by Philip Landrigan,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
to motivate a different view of health,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and the New York area

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and logged what they spent their patient hours on.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
80 to 90 percent of their time

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
was spent on five things.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Number one was asthma,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
number two was developmental delays,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
number three was 400-fold increases

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
in rare childhood cancers

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in the last eight to 10, 15 years.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Number four and five were childhood obesity

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and diabetes-related issues.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
This is not the germs

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that medicos were trained to deal with;

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
this is a different definition of health,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
health that has a great advantage

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
because it's external, it's shared,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
we can do something about it,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
or individualized.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
but impatients,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
to address local and environmental health issues.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that I set up in various places

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that provide an immersion

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
in some of the environmental challenges we face.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
I like this one from the Belgian field office,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
where we met in a roundabout,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
precisely because the roundabout iconified

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the headless social movement

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that informs much social transformation,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
as opposed to the top-down control

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
of red light traffic intersections.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
In this case, of course, the roundabout

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
with that micro-decisions being made in situ

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
by people not being told what to do.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But, of course, affords greater throughput,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
fewer accidents,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and an interesting model of social movement.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
or keeping tabs, if you will.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
What they are is an addition of tadpoles

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that are named after a local bureaucrat

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
whose decisions affect your water quality.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So an impatient concerned for water quality

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
would raise a tadpole bureaucrat

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
in a sample of water in which they're interested.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And we give them a couple of things to do that,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to help them do companion animal devices

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
while they're blogging and doing their email.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
This is a tadpole walker

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
to take your tadpole walking in the evening.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And the interesting thing that happens --

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
because we're using tadpoles, of course,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
several orders of magnitude more sensitive

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
than some of our senses

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
for sensing,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
responding in a biologically meaningful way,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to that whole class of industrial contaminants

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
we call endocrine disruptors

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
or hormone emulators.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
there's a few action shots --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And then you have to introduce your tadpole

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and who it's named after.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
You have to explain what you're doing

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
and how the developmental events of a tadpole

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
are, of course, very observable

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And so next time your neighbor sees you

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And you can let them social network with your tadpole,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
for, not only impatients, humans,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
but non-humans,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
social networking for humans and non-humans.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And of course, these endocrine disruptors

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
the obesity epidemic,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and other related things.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
observing the behavioral

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and developmental events,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
you will then go and introduce your tadpole

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to its namesake

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and discuss the evidence that you've seen.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
instead of asking you for urine samples,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
I'll ask you for a mouse sample.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
a domestic partnership with mice?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Very lucky.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Mice, of course, are the quintessential

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
model organism.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
They're even better models of environmental health,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
because not only the same mammalian biology,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
but they share your diet, largely.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
They share your environmental stressors,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the asbestos levels and lead levels,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
whatever you're exposed to.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And they're geographically more limited than you are,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
because we don't know if you've been exposed

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
to persistent organic pollutants

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
in your home, or occupationally

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
or as a child.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Mice are a very good representation.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
This is one of them.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Is anybody here on antidepressants?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
(Laughter)

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And we were testing if the mice

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
would also self-administer SSRIs.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So do you think the mice

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
self-administered antidepressants?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
How did you know that? They did.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Where's our expert?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Vodka, gin --

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
(Audience: [unclear])

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
They did, yes.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
which was interesting.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We take the blood sample

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
of framing health in this external way.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
But we do have a few prescription products through this.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
It's very different from the medical model.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
or to understand it or to change it,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
the benefits are enjoyed by anyone

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
you share that water quality or air quality with.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And that aggregating effect,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
that collective action effect,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
is actually something we can use to our advantage.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
called the No Park.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
This is a prescription to improve water quality.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
What we do is we take a fire hydrant,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to create an engineered micro landscape,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
to create an infiltration opportunity.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Because, many of you will know,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that the biggest pollution burden

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
is no longer the point sources,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
no longer the big polluters,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
no longer the GEs,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
but that massive network of roads,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
[those] impervious surfaces,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
or the oily hydrocarbon waste

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
washes it straight into the estuary system.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
That doesn't do a lot of good.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
before they enter the harbor,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and they're produced by impatients

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
on various city blocks

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
in some very interesting ways.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
there's about two or three fire hydrants

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
on every city block.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
we don't prevent them from being used

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
as emergency vehicle parking spaces,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
But if we did this

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
in every single --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
every fire hydrant

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
we could redefine the emergency.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
That 99 percent of the time

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
when a firetruck is not parking there,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
it's infiltrating pollutants.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
It's also increasing fixing CO2s,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And aggregated,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
these smaller interceptions

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that now runs into the estuary system,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
So these are small actions

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
that can amount to a significant effect

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
to improve local environmental health.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
This is one of the more ambitious ones.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
What the climate crisis has revealed to us

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
is a secondary, more insidious

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and more pervasive crisis,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
which is the crisis of agency,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
which is what to do.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
doesn't seem sufficient

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
in the face of climate crisis.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
And this is an interesting icon that happened --

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
you remember these: fallout shelters.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
What is the fallout shelter

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
for the climate crisis?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
This was civic mobilization.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Churches, school groups,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
hospitals, private residents --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
everyone built one of these in a matter of months.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And they still remain

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
as icons of civic response

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
I would say, looks something like this, or this,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
which is an intensive urban agriculture facility

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
What it does

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
is a very simple idea

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
of taking --

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
is building related --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
we take the CO2 from the building --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
CO2-enriched air --

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
we force it through the urban agriculture facility,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
So it's on legs,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
It's built as a barn raising,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
using open source hardware.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
This is the quarter-scale prototype

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that was functioning in Spain.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
NYU willing.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And what I want to show you is --

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
which is a solar chimney --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
that passively draws air up.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
You understand a solar chimney.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Hot air rises.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
What we do is actually

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
That actually removes about 95 percent

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
of the carbon black,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that stuff that, with ozone,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
because it changes, it settles on the snow,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
it changes the reflectors,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
it changes

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Carbon black is that grime

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and it's associated with.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
not from combustion itself.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
When we put it through our solar chimney,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
we remove actually about 95 percent of that.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And then I swap it out

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
with the students

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and actually re-release that carbon black.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that we've pulled out of the air.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Here's one of them that we have up now.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Okay, so I want to show you

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
just two more interfaces,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
because I think one of our big challenges

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
not only through this model

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
of twisted personalized health,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
but through the animals

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
with whom we cohabit.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
In fact, urban migration now describes

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
the movement of animals formerly known as wild

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
into urban centers.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
elk in Westchester County.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
It's happening all over the Developed World,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
probably for loss of habitat,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
but also because our cities are a little bit more livable

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
than they have been.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And every green space we create

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
But we've kind of lacked imagination

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
in how we could do that well or interestingly.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
which is zoo backwards and without cages --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
to try and reform

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
that relationship.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
each of which had a different argument on it,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
different sound file.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
They said things like this.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
(Whistling)

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
the ones you call bird food,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and bring it here and scatter it around.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
There's a good person.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
So there was several of these.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
These are just your average urban pigeon.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And an early test

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
which argument elicited cooperative behavior

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
from the people below --

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
about a hundred to one

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
decided that this was the argument

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
that worked best on us.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
That's the sound of genetic mutations

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
of the avian flu

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
becoming a deadly human flu.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Do you know what slows it down?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Healthy sub-populations of birds,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
increasing biodiversity generally.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
It is in your interests that I'm healthy,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
happy, well-fed.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
instead of monopolizing them.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
That is, share your lunch.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
(Laughter)

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
NJ: It worked, and it's true.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
The final project I'd like to show you

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
is a new interface for fish

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
that has just been launched --

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
it's actually officially launched next week --

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
but there is now a device for you to do so.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
project three foot up, three foot down.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
This is what it looks like.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
So there's another function on here.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
this top light is actually a water quality display

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And then you can also text the fish.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
So there's business cards down there

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
that'll give you contact details.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
And they text back.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
But perhaps the most popular has been

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
where the first beaver --

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
crazy as he is --

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
to have moved in and built a lodge in New York

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
in 250 years, hangs out.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
So updates from a beaver.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
And what I like to think of

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
is this is an interface

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
specifically by changing who has information,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
where they have it,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
who can make sense of that information,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and what you can do about it.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
that's in the middle of the city,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
and the largest pollution burden on it

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
is not the roadborne pollution,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
it's actually white bread

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
from people feeding the fish and the birds.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
that you can feed the fish.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
They're delicious.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
They're cross-species delicious that is,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
delicious for humans and non-humans.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
But they also have a chelating agent in them.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
They're nutritionally appropriate,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
not like Doritos.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And so every time

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
that desire to interact with the animals,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.260
which is at least as ubiquitous

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
And Yellowstone National Park,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
there's more "do not feed the animals" signs

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
than there are animals you might wish to feed.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
But in that action, that interaction,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
by re-scripting that,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
by changing it into an opportunity

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
that could augment the nutritional resources

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
that we ourselves have depleted

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
for augmenting the fish population

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
and also adding chelating agent,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.260
which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
that are in the fish

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
living in this particular habitat

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
where it's complexed by a reactive,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
effectively removing it from bioavailability.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
But I wanted to say that interaction,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
re-scripting that interaction,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
into collective action, collective remediative action,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
very different from the approach

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
where we're dredging the PCBs --

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.260
after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
GE's paying for the dredging

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
of the largest Superfund site in the world --

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
or the nearest Third World country,

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
where it will continue to be toxic sludge.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
And that's typically the paradigm

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
under which we've operated.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
By actually taking the opportunity

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
that new technologies,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
new interactive technologies, present

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
to re-script our interactions,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
to script them,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
not just as isolated, individuated interactions,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.260
but as collective aggregating actions

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
that can amount to something,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
we can really begin to address

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
some of our important environmental challenges.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
Thank you.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
