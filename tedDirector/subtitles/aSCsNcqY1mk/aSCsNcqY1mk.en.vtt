00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
What's happening to the climate?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
It is unbelievably bad.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
which is likely to be gone at this point

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
So we all look at what we can do.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
52 percent are tied to buildings.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
So we ran off to a sushi bar.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
And it was something called EcoRock.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
gypsum drywall process that generates

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
which is exactly what we've done.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
We started R&amp;D in 2006.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
Decided to use recycled content from cement

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
and steel manufacturing.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
But our people had to do some 5,000

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
We did the line install over the summer.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
not made using gypsum at all.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
That's the finished production line there.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
We got our first panel out on December third.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.330
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
Thank you. Thank you.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
equivalent to build one house.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
We must change everything.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Look around the room: chairs, wood,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.330
everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.330
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
We're going as fast as we can.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
you know, CO2 generated. Right?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
Those are my kids, Natalie and David.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
When they have their kids, 2050,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
with the team that you had."

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
So my hope is that when you leave TED,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
you will look at reducing your carbon footprint

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
in however you can do it.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.330
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Thank you so much.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
(Applause)
