00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
dates back hundreds of years.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
But modernization actually brought communication

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.160
started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So, here you can see the change

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
led me to a new form,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
at that point, and started developing, really,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.160
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
but to produce to our color specifications.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
At the same time, I was thinking, well,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.160
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
that could be exported and also service our local market.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
forms. The scale became very important,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
and it's become our pet project. It's successful,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
This is our group, our main group of weavers.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
They all have bank accounts.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
It's a weekly turnaround of production.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And that's also modernized today,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And the rest says it all.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Thank you very much.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
