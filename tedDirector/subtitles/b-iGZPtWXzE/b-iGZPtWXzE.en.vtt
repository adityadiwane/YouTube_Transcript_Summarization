00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.831
Running: it's basically just
right, left, right, left, yeah?

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:21.284
I mean, we've been doing it
for two million years,

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:24.854
so it's kind of arrogant to assume
that I've got something to say

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.098
that hasn't been said and performed
better a long time ago.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.052
But the cool thing about running,
as I've discovered,

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:34.661
is that something bizarre happens
in this activity all the time.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:38.260
Case in point: A couple months ago,
if you saw the New York City Marathon,

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:41.872
I guarantee you, you saw something
that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:46.324
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
turns up at the starting line.

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:48.374
She's 37 years old.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:51.084
She hasn't won a marathon
of any kind in eight years,

00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:52.536
and a few months previously,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.536
she had almost died in childbirth.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.051
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up
and retire from the sport,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.947
but she decided she'd go for broke

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.759
and try for one last big payday
in the marquee event,

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:05.398
the New York City Marathon.

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:09.136
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --
some other people had the same idea,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.014
including the Olympic gold medalist,

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:14.136
and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.732
the fastest woman marathoner
in history by far.

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:20.033
Only 10 minutes
off the men's world record,

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:22.961
Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.

00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:25.136
That's her competition.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.108
The gun goes off, and -- I mean,
she's not even an underdog;

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:29.947
she's, like, under the underdogs.

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.016
But the under-underdog hangs tough,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.851
and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:37.771
there is Derartu Tulu,
up there with the lead pack.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.255
Now, this is when something
really bizarre happens.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.041
Paula Radcliffe, the one person
who is sure to snatch the big paycheck

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.136
from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.557
suddenly grabs her leg
and starts to fall back.

00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.992
So we all know what to do
in this situation, right?

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:55.702
You give her a quick crack
in the teeth with your elbow

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.225
and blaze for the finish line.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.739
Derartu Tulu ruins the script.

00:01:59.763 --> 00:02:01.212
Instead of taking off,

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:03.485
she falls back and she grabs
Paula Radcliffe,

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.847
and says, "Come on.
Come with us. You can do it."

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:08.282
So Paula Radcliffe,
unfortunately, does it.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:09.919
She catches up with the lead pack

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:11.806
and is pushing toward the finish line.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.349
But then she falls back again.

00:02:13.373 --> 00:02:16.365
The second time, Derartu Tulu
grabs her and tries to pull her.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.227
And Paula Radcliffe, at that point,
says, "I'm done. Go."

00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.527
So that's a fantastic story,
and we all know how it ends.

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:23.841
She loses the check,

00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:26.790
but she goes home with something
bigger and more important.

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:29.310
Except Derartu Tulu
ruins the script again.

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:32.834
Instead of losing, she blazes
past the lead pack and wins.

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:34.520
Wins the New York City Marathon,

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:36.178
goes home with a big fat check.

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:38.473
It's a heartwarming story,

00:02:38.497 --> 00:02:40.474
but if you drill a little bit deeper,

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:43.906
you've got to sort of wonder
about what exactly was going on there.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.065
When you have two outliers
in one organism,

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.463
it's not a coincidence.

00:02:47.487 --> 00:02:50.978
When you have someone who is more
competitive and more compassionate

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.979
than anybody else in the race,
again, it's not a coincidence.

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.446
You show me a creature
with webbed feet and gills;

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.118
somehow water's involved.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:01.524
Someone with that kind of heart,
there's some kind of connection there.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.115
And the answer to it,
I think, can be found

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.548
down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,

00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:10.449
where there's a reclusive tribe,
called the Tarahumara Indians.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:14.032
Now, the Tarahumara
are remarkable for three things.

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:15.531
Number one is:

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:19.761
they have been living essentially
unchanged for the past 400 years.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:23.399
When the conquistadors arrived
in North America you had two choices:

00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:26.136
you either fight back and engage
or you could take off.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.018
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.488
which is why there are very few
Mayans and Aztecs.

00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:32.497
The Tarahumara had a different strategy.

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.385
They took off and hid

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.264
in this labyrinthine, networking,
spider-webbing system of canyons

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:40.689
called the Copper Canyons.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:44.136
And there they've remained
since the 1600s,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.763
essentially the same way
they've always been.

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.738
The second thing remarkable
about the Tarahumara is:

00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:53.890
deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:55.891
these guys aren't running marathons;

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:57.762
they're running mega-marathons.

00:03:57.786 --> 00:03:59.431
They're not doing 26 miles,

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:02.077
they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:04.570
and apparently without injury,
without problems.

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.932
The last thing that's remarkable
about the Tarahumara is:

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.473
all the things we're going
to be talking about today,

00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:13.302
all the things we're trying to use
all of our technology

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:14.664
and brain power to solve --

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.238
things like heart disease
and cholesterol and cancer;

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:20.860
crime, warfare and violence;
clinical depression -- all this stuff --

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:23.356
the Tarahumara don't know
what you're talking about.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.136
They are free from all
of these modern ailments.

00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:29.217
So what's the connection?

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:30.979
Again, we're talking about outliers;

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.294
there's got to be some kind
of cause and effect.

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:37.136
Well, there are teams of scientists
at Harvard and the University of Utah

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.740
that are bending their brains
and trying to figure out

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:41.707
what the Tarahumara have known forever.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.395
They're trying to solve
those same kinds of mysteries.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.842
And once again, a mystery
wrapped inside of a mystery --

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:50.985
perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu
and the Tarahumara

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.646
is wrapped in three other
mysteries, which go like this:

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.079
Three things -- if you have the answer,
come up and take the microphone,

00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:58.932
because nobody else knows the answer.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:01.841
If you know it, you're smarter
than anybody on planet Earth.

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:03.288
Mystery number one is this:

00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:06.066
Two million years ago,
the human brain exploded in size.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.201
Australopithecus
had a tiny little pea brain.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:11.271
Suddenly humans show up,
Homo erectus, big old melon head.

00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:12.818
To have a brain of that size,

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:16.445
you need to have a source
of condensed caloric energy.

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.090
In other words, early humans
are eating dead animals --

00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:20.446
no argument, that's a fact.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.377
The only problem is,

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:25.991
the first edged weapons only appeared
about 200,000 years ago.

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:28.710
So somehow, for nearly two million years,

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:31.405
we are killing animals
without any weapons.

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:33.129
Now, we're not using our strength,

00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:35.511
because we are the biggest
sissies in the jungle.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:37.577
Every other animal
is stronger than we are,

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:41.031
they have fangs, they have claws,
they have nimbleness, they have speed.

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:42.426
We think Usain Bolt is fast.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.794
Usain Bolt can get
his ass kicked by a squirrel.

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:45.969
We're not fast.

00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:47.484
That would be an Olympic event:

00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:50.345
turn a squirrel loose,
whoever catches it gets a gold medal.

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:51.384
(Laughter)

00:05:51.408 --> 00:05:54.126
So no weapons, no speed,
no strength, no fangs, no claws.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.792
How were we killing these animals?
Mystery number one.

00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:58.257
Mystery number two:

00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.334
Women have been in the Olympics
for quite some time now,

00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:04.166
but one thing that's remarkable
about all women sprinters:

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.945
they all suck; they're terrible.

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.697
There's not a fast woman on the planet
and there never has been.

00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:12.698
The fastest woman
to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:14.940
I could throw a rock
and hit a high-school boy

00:06:14.964 --> 00:06:16.460
who can run faster than 4:15.

00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:18.675
For some reason,
you guys are just really slow.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:19.857
But --

00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.940
(Laughter)

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.710
But, you get to the marathon
we were just talking about --

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.512
you've only been allowed to run
the marathon for 20 years,

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:28.807
because prior to the 1980s,
medical science said

00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:32.195
if a woman tried to run 26 miles --
does anyone know what would happen

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.652
if you tried to run 26 miles?

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:36.292
Why you were banned
from the marathon before the 1980s?

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:38.402
Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:40.954
Christopher McDougall:
Her uterus would be torn, yes.

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.218
Torn reproductive organs.

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:44.501
The uterus would literally
fall out of the body.

00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:45.546
(Laughter)

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.389
Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,

00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:49.054
and I've yet to see any ...

00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:51.987
(Laughter)

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.378
So it's only been 20 years

00:06:53.402 --> 00:06:55.781
that women have been allowed
to run the marathon.

00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:59.826
In that very short learning curve,
you've gone from broken organs

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.651
up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes
off the male world record.

00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:05.980
Then you go beyond 26 miles,
into the distance

00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:08.937
that medical science also told us
would be fatal to humans --

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.327
remember Pheidippides died
when he ran 26 miles --

00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.619
you get to 50 and 100 miles,
and suddenly, it's a different game.

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.886
You take a runner like Ann Trason
or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.337
put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles
against anybody in the world,

00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:23.338
and it's a coin toss who's going to win.

00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:24.708
I'll give you an example.

00:07:24.732 --> 00:07:27.247
A couple years ago,
Emily Baer signed up for a race

00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:28.961
called the Hardrock 100,

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:31.547
which tells you all you need
to know about the race.

00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:33.610
They give you 48 hours
to finish this race.

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.539
Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --

00:07:35.563 --> 00:07:37.910
she finishes in eighth place,
in the top 10,

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:40.188
even though she stopped
at all the aid stations

00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:42.107
to breastfeed her baby during the race.

00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:43.145
(Laughter)

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:44.867
And yet, she beat 492 other people.

00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:46.548
The last mystery:

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:49.356
Why is it that women get stronger
as distances get longer?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.716
The third mystery is this:

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.208
At the University of Utah,
they started tracking finishing times

00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.892
for people running the marathon.

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:59.723
What they found is that if you start
running the marathon at age 19,

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:02.000
you'll get progressively
faster, year by year,

00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:04.001
until you reach your peak at age 27.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:08.001
And then after that,
you succumb to the rigors of time.

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:09.617
And you'll get slower and slower,

00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:13.230
until eventually you're back to running
the same speed you were at age 19.

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:15.495
So about seven, eight years
to reach your peak,

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:17.595
and then gradually you fall off your peak,

00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:19.897
until you go back to the starting point.

00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:23.141
You'd think it might take eight years
to go back to the same speed,

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:25.897
maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.

00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:27.898
64-year-old men and women

00:08:27.922 --> 00:08:30.961
are running as fast
as they were at age 19.

00:08:30.985 --> 00:08:33.973
Now, I defy you to come
up with any other physical activity --

00:08:33.997 --> 00:08:36.959
and please don't say golf --
something that's actually hard --

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.031
(Laughter)

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:42.602
where geriatrics are performing
as well as they did as teenagers.

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:44.426
So you have these three mysteries.

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:48.898
Is there one piece in the puzzle
which might wrap all these things up?

00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:52.289
You've got to be careful anytime
someone looks back in prehistory

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:54.619
and tries to give you
a global answer because,

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:57.430
it being prehistory, you can say
whatever the hell you want

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.613
and get away with it.

00:08:58.637 --> 00:09:00.003
But I'll submit this to you:

00:09:00.027 --> 00:09:02.728
If you put one piece in the middle
of this jigsaw puzzle,

00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:05.130
suddenly it all starts
to form a coherent picture.

00:09:05.154 --> 00:09:07.542
If you're wondering
why the Tarahumara don't fight

00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:09.090
and don't die of heart disease,

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:11.874
why a poor Ethiopian
woman named Derartu Tulu

00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:14.727
can be the most compassionate
and yet the most competitive,

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:18.574
and why we somehow were able
to find food without weapons,

00:09:18.598 --> 00:09:20.575
perhaps it's because humans,

00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:23.821
as much as we like to think of ourselves
as masters of the universe,

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:27.263
actually evolved as nothing more
than a pack of hunting dogs.

00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:31.122
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:34.069
Because the one advantage
we have in the wilderness --

00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:36.549
again, it's not our fangs,
our claws or our speed --

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:38.898
the only thing we do really well is sweat.

00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:41.700
We're really good
at being sweaty and smelly.

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:44.962
Better than any other mammal
on Earth, we can sweat really well.

00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:48.850
But the advantage of that little bit
of social discomfort

00:09:48.874 --> 00:09:53.981
is the fact that, when it comes to running
under hot heat for long distances,

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.249
we're superb -- the best on the planet.

00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:58.358
You take a horse on a hot day,

00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:01.270
and after about five or six miles,
that horse has a choice:

00:10:01.294 --> 00:10:03.947
it's either going to breathe
or it's going to cool off.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.549
But it ain't doing both. We can.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.915
So what if we evolved
as hunting pack animals?

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:12.564
What if the only natural advantage
we had in the world

00:10:12.588 --> 00:10:14.985
was the fact that we could
get together as a group,

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.997
go out there on that African savanna,
pick out an antelope,

00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:20.530
go out as a pack,
and run that thing to death?

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:22.732
That's all we could do.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.733
We could run really far on a hot day.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.957
Well, if that's true, a couple
other things had to be true as well.

00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:30.810
The key to being part
of a hunting pack is the word "pack."

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:33.442
If you go out by yourself
and try to chase an antelope,

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.323
I guarantee there will be two cadavers
out in the savanna.

00:10:36.347 --> 00:10:37.990
You need a pack to pull together.

00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:40.242
You need to have
those 64- and 65-year-olds

00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:42.245
who have been doing this for a long time

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.761
to understand which antelope
you're trying to catch.

00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:46.886
The herd explodes
and it gathers back again.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.278
Those expert trackers
have to be part of the pack.

00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:50.766
They can't be 10 miles behind.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.974
You need the women
and the adolescents there,

00:10:52.998 --> 00:10:56.390
because the two times in your life
you most benefit from animal protein

00:10:56.414 --> 00:10:59.285
is when you're a nursing mother
and a developing adolescent.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:01.959
It makes no sense to have
the antelope over there, dead,

00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:04.236
and the people who want
to eat it 50 miles away.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.843
They need to be part of the pack.

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:08.704
You need those 27-year-old studs
at the peak of their powers

00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:09.884
ready to drop the kill,

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.339
and you need those teenagers
who are learning the whole thing involved.

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:14.519
The pack stays together.

00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:17.899
Another thing that has to be true:
this pack cannot be materialistic.

00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:21.352
You can't be hauling all your crap around,
trying to chase the antelope.

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.862
You can't be a pissed-off pack.

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:26.325
You can't be bearing grudges, like,
"I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.

00:11:26.349 --> 00:11:28.871
He pissed me off.
Let him go chase his own antelope."

00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:31.136
The pack has got to be able
to swallow its ego,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.938
be cooperative, and pull together.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.907
What you end up with, in other words,

00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:39.704
is a culture remarkably similar
to the Tarahumara,

00:11:39.728 --> 00:11:43.307
a tribe that has remained
unchanged since the Stone Age.

00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:45.571
It's a really compelling argument

00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:49.243
that maybe the Tarahumara are doing
exactly what all of us had done

00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:50.425
for two million years,

00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:53.493
that it's us in modern times
who have sort of gone off the path.

00:11:53.517 --> 00:11:56.798
You know, we look at running
as this kind of alien, foreign thing,

00:11:56.822 --> 00:12:00.291
this punishment you've got to do
because you ate pizza the night before.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:02.007
But maybe it's something different.

00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:05.128
Maybe we're the ones who have taken
this natural advantage we had

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:06.480
and we spoiled it.

00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:09.608
How do we spoil it?
Well, how do we spoil anything?

00:12:09.632 --> 00:12:11.196
We try to cash in on it. Right?

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.986
We try to can it and package it
and make it "better"

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.399
and then sell it to people.

00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:17.917
And then what happened was,
we started creating

00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:21.375
these fancy cushioned things
which can make running "better,"

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:22.815
called running shoes.

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:25.771
The reason I get personally
pissed-off about running shoes

00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:28.772
is because I bought a million of them
and I kept getting hurt.

00:12:28.796 --> 00:12:30.773
And I think if anybody in here runs --

00:12:30.797 --> 00:12:32.577
I just had a conversation with Carol.

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.232
We talked for two minutes backstage,
and she talked about plantar fasciitis.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.807
You talk to a runner,
I guarantee within 30 seconds,

00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:40.460
the conversation turns to injury.

00:12:40.484 --> 00:12:43.771
So if humans evolved as runners,
if that's our one natural advantage,

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:45.268
then why are we so bad at it?

00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:46.903
Why do we keep getting hurt?

00:12:46.927 --> 00:12:49.299
A curious thing about running
and running injuries

00:12:49.323 --> 00:12:51.811
is that the running injury
is new to our time.

00:12:51.835 --> 00:12:53.659
If you read folklore and mythology,

00:12:53.683 --> 00:12:55.684
any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:59.316
running is always associated
with freedom and vitality

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.136
and youthfulness and eternal vigor.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.054
It's only in our lifetime
that running has become associated

00:13:04.078 --> 00:13:05.233
with fear and pain.

00:13:05.257 --> 00:13:09.368
Geronimo used to say, "My only friends
are my legs. I only trust my legs."

00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:13.011
That's because an Apache triathlon
used to be you'd run 50 miles

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:14.186
across the desert,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.822
engage in hand-to-hand combat,
steal a bunch of horses,

00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:18.176
and slap leather for home.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.925
Geronimo was never saying, "You know
something, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.

00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:23.509
I've got to take this week off."

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.550
Or, "I need to cross-train.
I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."

00:13:26.574 --> 00:13:27.977
(Laughter)

00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.826
Humans ran and ran all the time.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.347
We are here today.
We have our digital technology.

00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.282
All of our science comes from the fact

00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:38.136
that our ancestors were able to do
something extraordinary every day,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.589
which was just rely
on their naked feet and legs

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:42.059
to run long distances.

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:43.882
So how do we get back to that again?

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:46.118
Well, I would submit
to you the first thing is:

00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:48.967
get rid of all packaging,
all the sales, all the marketing.

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:51.063
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.

00:13:51.087 --> 00:13:53.040
Stop focusing on urban marathons,

00:13:53.064 --> 00:13:55.860
which, if you do four hours, you suck,

00:13:55.884 --> 00:13:57.837
and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,

00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:00.040
because you qualified for another race.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
We need to get back to that sense
of playfulness and joyfulness

00:14:03.184 --> 00:14:06.054
and, I would say, nakedness,

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:07.980
that has made the Tarahumara

00:14:08.004 --> 00:14:10.583
one of the healthiest and serene
cultures in our time.

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.005
So what's the benefit? So what?

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:15.898
So you burn off the Häagen-Dazs
from the night before.

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:18.344
But maybe there's another
benefit there as well.

00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:21.501
Without getting too extreme about this,

00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:26.136
imagine a world where everybody
could go out the door

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.136
and engage in the kind of exercise

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.136
that's going to make them
more relaxed, more serene,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.465
more healthy,

00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:33.801
burn off stress --

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:37.014
where you don't come back into your office
a raging maniac anymore,

00:14:37.038 --> 00:14:39.522
or go home with a lot of stress
on top of you again.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.877
Maybe there's something
between what we are today

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:44.409
and what the Tarahumara have always been.

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:46.662
I don't say let's go back
to the Copper Canyons

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:50.071
and live on corn and maize,
which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,

00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:52.175
but maybe there's somewhere in between.

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.866
And if we find that thing,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.470
maybe there is a big fat
Nobel Prize out there.

00:14:56.494 --> 00:15:01.381
Because if somebody could find a way
to restore that natural ability

00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:03.577
that we all enjoyed
for most of our existence

00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:05.172
up until the 1970s or so,

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:10.587
the benefits -- social and physical
and political and mental --

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:11.884
could be astounding.

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:15.977
What I've been seeing today
is there is a growing subculture

00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:18.920
of barefoot runners,
people who've gotten rid of their shoes.

00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:20.830
And what they have found uniformly is,

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:23.381
you get rid of the shoes,
you get rid of the stress,

00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:25.873
you get rid of the injuries
and the ailments.

00:15:25.897 --> 00:15:28.687
And what you find is something
the Tarahumara have known

00:15:28.711 --> 00:15:29.876
for a very long time:

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.662
that this can be a whole lot of fun.

00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:33.513
I've experienced it personally myself.

00:15:33.537 --> 00:15:36.893
I was injured all my life; then
in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes

00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:39.136
and my running ailments
have gone away, too.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.718
So hopefully it's something
we can all benefit from.

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:43.784
I appreciate your listening to this story.

00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:44.959
Thanks very much.

00:15:44.983 --> 00:15:46.974
(Applause)
