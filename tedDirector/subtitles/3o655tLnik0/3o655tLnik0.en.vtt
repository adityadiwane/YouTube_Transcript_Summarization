00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.536
So, I had been a photographer

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.994
for 18 years

00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:19.412
before I began the Microsculpture Project.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.814
And in that time,
I had shot global ad campaigns,

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:27.019
I had the opportunity to photograph
some of my generation's icons,

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:28.699
and I was traveling the world.

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:33.066
I got to a point in my career
that I dreamed of getting to,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.763
and yet, for some reason,
I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.976
Despite the extraordinary things
I was shooting and experiencing,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.900
they'd started to feel
a little bit ordinary to me.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.451
I was also getting concerned

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:49.601
about how disposable photography
had started to feel in the digital world,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.484
and I really wanted to produce images
that had a sense of worth again.

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:55.907
And I needed a subject
that felt extraordinary.

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.952
Sometimes I wish
I had the eyes of a child.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.520
And by that I mean,
I wish I could look at the world

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:04.797
in the same as I did
when I was a small boy.

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.362
I think there is a danger,
as we get older,

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:12.465
that our curiosity becomes
slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:15.745
And as a visual creator,
one of the challenges for me

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.855
is to present the familiar
in a new and engaging way.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.124
Fortunately for me, though,
I've got two great kids

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:25.138
who are still curious about the world.

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:30.931
Sebastian -- he's still curious
about the world, and in 2014, in spring,

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:33.812
he brought in a ground beetle
from the garden.

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:36.634
There was nothing particularly special
about this insect --

00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:38.781
you know, it was a common species.

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:40.155
But he was still curious,

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.587
and he brought it up to my office,

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:45.038
and we decided to look at it
under his microscope.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:47.456
He had a little science kit for Christmas.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.487
And this is what we saw.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.217
Now, when I first saw this,
it blew me away.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.278
Up here -- this is the back
of the ground beetle.

00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:58.846
When I first saw it,
it reminded me of a galaxy.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.221
And all the time, this had just
been outside our window.

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:04.930
You know, I was looking
for this extraordinary subject,

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:08.457
and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity
to bring it in to me.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:13.059
So I decided to photograph it for him,
and this is what I produced.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.829
I basically asked myself
two simple questions.

00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:17.019
The first one:

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:20.861
Could I take all my knowledge and skill
of photographic lighting

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:24.015
and take that onto a subject
that's five millimeters long?

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.670
But also: Could I keep
creative control over that lighting

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:29.410
on a subject that size?

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:32.740
So I practiced
on some other found specimens,

00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:36.290
and I approached the Oxford University
Museum of Natural History

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:39.126
to see if I could have access
to their collection,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.628
to progress the project.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:43.066
And I went up there for a meeting,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.966
and I showed them some of the images
that I'd been shooting,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.111
and they could see
the kind of detail I was able to get.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.929
I don't think they'd ever really seen
anything quite like it before,

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:55.455
and from that point forward,
they gave me open access

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.793
to their entire collection

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.687
and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan,
their entomologist.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:04.007
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,

00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.075
I shot 37 insects from their collection.

00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:09.426
And the way I work

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.534
is that I essentially split the insect
up into multiple sections,

00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:17.366
and I treat each one of those sections
like a small still life.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.110
So for example, if I was photographing
the eye of the insect,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.922
which is normally quite smooth
and dome-shaped,

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:28.325
then I'd use a light source
that is large and soft and diffuse,

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.690
so I don't get any harsh hot spots
on that surface.

00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:35.782
But once my attention
turns over to a hairy leg,

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:38.379
that lighting setup
will change completely.

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:42.040
And so I make that one tiny section
look as beautiful as I possibly can,

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:43.888
and I work my way across the insect

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:46.684
until I have about 20 or 25
different sections.

00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:51.925
The issue with photography
at high magnification

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.194
is that there is inherently
a very shallow depth of field.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.981
So to get around that, what I do is,

00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.447
I put my camera on a rail

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.814
that I can automate
to move 10 microns in between each shot.

00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:05.493
That's about one-seventh the width
of a human hair.

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:10.124
And then that provides me
with a deep stack of images.

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:13.209
Each has a tiny sliver of focus
all the way through.

00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:15.329
And I can squash that down

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:18.784
to produce one image
that is fully focused from front to back.

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:22.353
So essentially, that gives me
25 sections that are fully focused

00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:23.753
and beautifully lit.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.508
Now, each one of my images

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:30.593
is made up of anywhere
between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:33.943
They take about three-and-a-half
weeks to create,

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:38.220
and the file sizes on average
are about four gigabytes.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:41.363
So I've got plenty of information
to play with when I'm printing.

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:45.037
And the prints at the exhibition
are around the three-meter mark.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.624
In fact, I had a show
in Milan two weeks ago,

00:04:47.648 --> 00:04:50.405
and we had some prints there
that were nine meters long.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.201
But, you know, I realize

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:56.133
that these images still have to work
in the digital world.

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:59.249
There's no point in me putting
all my blood, sweat and tears

00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:00.424
into these pictures

00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:03.573
if they're only going to be showing
500 pixels on a screen.

00:05:03.597 --> 00:05:07.138
So with the help of Rob Chandler
and Will Cookson,

00:05:07.162 --> 00:05:08.956
we developed a website

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.785
that enables the viewer
to immerse themselves

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.834
into the full four-gigabyte files,

00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:16.888
and they can explore
all that microscopic detail.

00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:19.517
So if you have the time,
and I encourage you,

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.308
please visit microsculpture.net

00:05:21.332 --> 00:05:22.847
and go and have a play.

00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.029
It's good fun.

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:27.844
I first showed the work at Oxford,

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:30.792
and since then, it's moved on
to the Middle East.

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.937
It's now back in Europe
and goes to Copenhagen this month.

00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:36.142
And the feedback has been great.

00:05:36.746 --> 00:05:41.391
You know, I get emails, actually,
from all over the world --

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.570
from teachers, at the moment,
who are using the website in school.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.422
The kids are using them on the tablet.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.147
They're zooming into the pictures

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:50.398
and using it for art class, biology class.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:52.570
And that's not something I planned.

00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:55.185
That's just a beautiful offshoot
of the project.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.838
In fact, one of the things
I like to do at the exhibitions

00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:00.939
is actually look at
the kiddies' reactions.

00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:03.686
And, you know, standing
in front of a three-meter insect,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.245
they could have been horrified.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:07.155
But they're not. They look in wonder.

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.625
This little chap here, he stood there
for five minutes, motionless.

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.111
(Laughter)

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:16.048
And at the end of the day, actually,
at the end of the day at the exhibitions,

00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:19.093
we have to wipe down
the lower third of the big prints --

00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:20.116
(Laughter)

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.315
just to remove
all those sticky handprints,

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.155
because all they want to do
is touch those big bugs.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.730
I do want to leave you
with one final image, if that's OK.

00:06:29.754 --> 00:06:31.803
This has to do with Charles Darwin.

00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:34.676
One of the recent images
that I photographed

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:36.634
was this one here.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.528
I'm talking about the creature
in the box, not my cat.

00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:43.311
And this is a shield bug

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.508
that Charles Darwin
brought back from Australia

00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:48.860
on the HMS Beagle in 1836.

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:51.521
And when I got it home,

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.414
I stood in my kitchen
and stared at it for about 20 minutes.

00:06:54.438 --> 00:06:58.251
I couldn't believe I was in possession
of this beautiful creature.

00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:00.544
And at that moment, I kind of realized

00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:02.431
that this validated the project for me.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.933
The fact that the museum
was willing to risk me playing with this

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:08.283
kind of showed me
that my images had worth --

00:07:08.307 --> 00:07:10.103
you know, they weren't disposable.

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:12.669
That's the image that I produced.

00:07:12.693 --> 00:07:14.819
I often wonder, still,
when I look at this:

00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:17.323
What would Charles Darwin
make of these images?

00:07:17.347 --> 00:07:20.945
Do you think he'd like his picture
of his shield bug? I hope so.

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:22.133
So --

00:07:22.157 --> 00:07:26.609
(Applause)

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:28.580
You know, I think it's strange in a way.

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:30.662
I'm a visual person,
I'm a creative person,

00:07:30.686 --> 00:07:34.597
but I still needed the eyes of a child
to find my extraordinary subject.

00:07:35.485 --> 00:07:36.648
That's the way it was.

00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:39.177
So all I can say is,
thank you very much, Sebastian;

00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.426
I am very, very grateful.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.615
Thank you.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:47.562
(Applause)
