00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.600
This is Pleurobot.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.016
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed
to closely mimic a salamander species

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.440
called Pleurodeles waltl.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.496
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.560
and as you'll see later, it can also swim.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.471
So you might ask,
why did we design this robot?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.722
And in fact, this robot has been designed
as a scientific tool for neuroscience.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.896
Indeed, we designed it
together with neurobiologists

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.816
to understand how animals move,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.600
and especially how the spinal cord
controls locomotion.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.256
But the more I work in biorobotics,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.661
the more I'm really impressed
by animal locomotion.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.216
If you think of a dolphin swimming
or a cat running or jumping around,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.816
or even us as humans,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.656
when you go jogging or play tennis,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.920
we do amazing things.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.016
And in fact, our nervous system solves
a very, very complex control problem.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.136
It has to coordinate
more or less 200 muscles perfectly,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.840
because if the coordination is bad,
we fall over or we do bad locomotion.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280
And my goal is to understand
how this works.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.000
There are four main components
behind animal locomotion.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.736
The first component is just the body,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.736
and in fact we should never underestimate

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.240
to what extent the biomechanics
already simplify locomotion in animals.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.376
Then you have the spinal cord,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.376
and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.856
multiple reflexes that create
a sensorimotor coordination loop

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
between neural activity in the spinal cord
and mechanical activity.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.976
A third component
are central pattern generators.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.896
These are very interesting circuits
in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.536
that can generate, by themselves,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.296
very coordinated
rhythmic patterns of activity

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.696
while receiving
only very simple input signals.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.936
And these input signals

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.016
coming from descending modulation
from higher parts of the brain,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.736
like the motor cortex,
the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.896
will all modulate activity
of the spinal cord

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.376
while we do locomotion.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.616
But what's interesting is to what extent
just a low-level component,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.576
the spinal cord, together with the body,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.056
already solve a big part
of the locomotion problem.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.502
You probably know it by the fact
that you can cut the head off a chicken,

00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:10.913
it can still run for a while,

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.476
showing that just the lower part,
spinal cord and body,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.373
already solve a big part of locomotion.

00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:17.856
Now, understanding how this works
is very complex,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.176
because first of all,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.820
recording activity in the spinal cord
is very difficult.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.616
It's much easier to implant electrodes
in the motor cortex

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.696
than in the spinal cord,
because it's protected by the vertebrae.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.536
Especially in humans, very hard to do.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.336
A second difficulty is that locomotion
is really due to a very complex

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.416
and very dynamic interaction
between these four components.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.680
So it's very hard to find out
what's the role of each over time.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.616
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot
and mathematical models

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.840
can really help.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.736
So what's biorobotics?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.496
Biorobotics is a very active field
of research in robotics

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.976
where people want to
take inspiration from animals

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.456
to make robots to go outdoors,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.136
like service robots
or search and rescue robots

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.360
or field robots.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.576
And the big goal here
is to take inspiration from animals

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.936
to make robots that can handle
complex terrain --

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.576
stairs, mountains, forests,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.616
places where robots
still have difficulties

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.696
and where animals
can do a much better job.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.216
The robot can be a wonderful
scientific tool as well.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.860
There are some very nice projects
where robots are used,

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:20.856
like a scientific tool for neuroscience,
for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.000
And this is exactly
the purpose of Pleurobot.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.536
So what we do in my lab
is to collaborate with neurobiologists

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.776
like Jean-Marie Cabelguen,
a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.840
and we want to make spinal cord models
and validate them on robots.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.096
And here we want to start simple.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.096
So it's good to start with simple animals

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.376
like lampreys, which are
very primitive fish,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.896
and then gradually
go toward more complex locomotion,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.176
like in salamanders,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.696
but also in cats and in humans,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.920
in mammals.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.256
And here, a robot becomes
an interesting tool

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.216
to validate our models.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.256
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot
is a kind of dream becoming true.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.536
Like, more or less 20 years ago
I was already working on a computer

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.216
making simulations of lamprey
and salamander locomotion

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.776
during my PhD.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.176
But I always knew that my simulations
were just approximations.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.176
Like, simulating the physics in water
or with mud or with complex ground,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.856
it's very hard to simulate that
properly on a computer.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.920
Why not have a real robot
and real physics?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.736
So among all these animals,
one of my favorites is the salamander.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.216
You might ask why,
and it's because as an amphibian,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.096
it's a really key animal
from an evolutionary point of view.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.176
It makes a wonderful link
between swimming,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.096
as you find it in eels or fish,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.240
and quadruped locomotion,
as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.816
And in fact, the modern salamander

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.216
is very close to the first
terrestrial vertebrate,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.776
so it's almost a living fossil,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.736
which gives us access to our ancestor,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.680
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.616
So the salamander swims

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.136
by doing what's called
an anguilliform swimming gait,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.800
so they propagate a nice traveling wave
of muscle activity from head to tail.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.616
And if you place
the salamander on the ground,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.976
it switches to what's called
a walking trot gait.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.863
In this case, you have nice
periodic activation of the limbs

00:05:00.887 --> 00:05:02.496
which are very nicely coordinated

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.176
with this standing wave
undulation of the body,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.856
and that's exactly the gait
that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.856
Now, one thing which is very surprising
and fascinating in fact

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.016
is the fact that all this can be generated
just by the spinal cord and the body.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.040
So if you take
a decerebrated salamander --

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:20.080
it's not so nice
but you remove the head --

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:22.776
and if you electrically
stimulate the spinal cord,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.056
at low level of stimulation
this will induce a walking-like gait.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.536
If you stimulate a bit more,
the gait accelerates.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.456
And at some point, there's a threshold,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.016
and automatically,
the animal switches to swimming.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.416
This is amazing.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.936
Just changing the global drive,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.696
as if you are pressing the gas pedal

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.856
of descending modulation
to your spinal cord,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.880
makes a complete switch
between two very different gaits.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.016
And in fact, the same
has been observed in cats.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.056
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.296
you can switch between
walk, trot and gallop.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.056
Or in birds, you can make a bird
switch between walking,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.536
at a low level of stimulation,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.376
and flapping its wings
at high-level stimulation.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.416
And this really shows that the spinal cord

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.856
is a very sophisticated
locomotion controller.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.336
So we studied salamander locomotion
in more detail,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.456
and we had in fact access
to a very nice X-ray video machine

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.056
from Professor Martin Fischer
in Jena University in Germany.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.656
And thanks to that,
you really have an amazing machine

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.136
to record all the bone motion
in great detail.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.416
That's what we did.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.616
So we basically figured out
which bones are important for us

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.656
and collected their motion in 3D.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.376
And what we did is collect
a whole database of motions,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.056
both on ground and in water,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.564
to really collect a whole database
of motor behaviors

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:32.833
that a real animal can do.

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:36.008
And then our job as roboticists
was to replicate that in our robot.

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:39.416
So we did a whole optimization process
to find out the right structure,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.096
where to place the motors,
how to connect them together,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.000
to be able to replay
these motions as well as possible.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.040
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.616
So let's look at how close
it is to the real animal.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.456
So what you see here
is almost a direct comparison

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.176
between the walking
of the real animal and the Pleurobot.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.936
You can see that we have
almost a one-to-one exact replay

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.216
of the walking gait.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.840
If you go backwards and slowly,
you see it even better.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.896
But even better, we can do swimming.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.936
So for that we have a dry suit
that we put all over the robot --

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.056
(Laughter)

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.256
and then we can go in water
and start replaying the swimming gaits.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.616
And here, we were very happy,
because this is difficult to do.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.856
The physics of interaction are complex.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.296
Our robot is much bigger
than a small animal,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.376
so we had to do what's called
dynamic scaling of the frequencies

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.736
to make sure we had
the same interaction physics.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.176
But you see at the end,
we have a very close match,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.080
and we were very, very happy with this.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.696
So let's go to the spinal cord.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.016
So here what we did
with Jean-Marie Cabelguen

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.280
is model the spinal cord circuits.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.176
And what's interesting
is that the salamander

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.820
has kept a very primitive circuit,

00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:49.496
which is very similar
to the one we find in the lamprey,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.496
this primitive eel-like fish,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.256
and it looks like during evolution,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.216
new neural oscillators
have been added to control the limbs,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.656
to do the leg locomotion.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.856
And we know where
these neural oscillators are

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.136
but what we did was to make
a mathematical model

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.776
to see how they should be coupled

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.736
to allow this transition
between the two very different gaits.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.320
And we tested that on board of a robot.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.880
And this is how it looks.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.936
So what you see here
is a previous version of Pleurobot

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.056
that's completely controlled
by our spinal cord model

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.680
programmed on board of the robot.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.496
And the only thing we do

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.696
is send to the robot
through a remote control

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.216
the two descending signals
it normally should receive

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.840
from the upper part of the brain.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.176
And what's interesting is,
by playing with these signals,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.000
we can completely control
speed, heading and type of gait.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.816
For instance,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.416
when we stimulate at a low level,
we have the walking gait,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.416
and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.600
very rapidly it switches
to the swimming gait.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.696
And finally, we can also
do turning very nicely

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.240
by just stimulating more one side
of the spinal cord than the other.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.816
And I think it's really beautiful

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.096
how nature has distributed control

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.976
to really give a lot of responsibility
to the spinal cord

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.656
so that the upper part of the brain
doesn't need to worry about every muscle.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.216
It just has to worry
about this high-level modulation,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.816
and it's really the job of the spinal cord
to coordinate all the muscles.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.360
So now let's go to cat locomotion
and the importance of biomechanics.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.336
So this is another project

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.776
where we studied cat biomechanics,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.696
and we wanted to see how much
the morphology helps locomotion.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.336
And we found three important
criteria in the properties,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.680
basically, of the limbs.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.296
The first one is that a cat limb

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.016
more or less looks
like a pantograph-like structure.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.256
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.680
which keeps the upper segment
and the lower segments always parallel.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.696
So a simple geometrical system
that kind of coordinates a bit

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.536
the internal movement of the segments.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.616
A second property of cat limbs
is that they are very lightweight.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.496
Most of the muscles are in the trunk,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.416
which is a good idea,
because then the limbs have low inertia

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.216
and can be moved very rapidly.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.056
The last final important property is this
very elastic behavior of the cat limb,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.736
so to handle impacts and forces.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.096
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.320
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.816
So this is Peter Eckert,
who does his PhD on this robot,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.896
and as you see, it's a cute little robot.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.176
It looks a bit like a toy,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.256
but it was really used
as a scientific tool

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.576
to investigate these properties
of the legs of the cat.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.216
So you see, it's very compliant,
very lightweight,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.496
and also very elastic,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.296
so you can easily press it down
and it will not break.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.776
It will just jump, in fact.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.680
And this very elastic property
is also very important.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.056
And you also see a bit these properties

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.480
of these three segments
of the leg as pantograph.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.056
Now, what's interesting
is that this quite dynamic gait

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.976
is obtained purely in open loop,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.136
meaning no sensors,
no complex feedback loops.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.576
And that's interesting, because it means

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.616
that just the mechanics
already stabilized this quite rapid gait,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.816
and that really good mechanics
already basically simplify locomotion.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.136
To the extent that we can even
disturb a bit locomotion,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.816
as you will see in the next video,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.736
where we can for instance do some exercise
where we have the robot go down a step,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.376
and the robot will not fall over,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.976
which was a surprise for us.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.416
This is a small perturbation.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.856
I was expecting the robot
to immediately fall over,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.316
because there are no sensors,
no fast feedback loop.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.536
But no, just the mechanics
stabilized the gait,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.136
and the robot doesn't fall over.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.296
Obviously, if you make the step bigger,
and if you have obstacles,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.976
you need the full control loops
and reflexes and everything.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.936
But what's important here
is that just for small perturbation,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.456
the mechanics are right.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.576
And I think this is
a very important message

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.791
from biomechanics and robotics
to neuroscience,

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:45.495
saying don't underestimate to what extent
the body already helps locomotion.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.600
Now, how does this relate
to human locomotion?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.600
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex
than cat and salamander locomotion,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.496
but at the same time, the nervous system
of humans is very similar

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.096
to that of other vertebrates.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.576
And especially the spinal cord

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.240
is also the key controller
for locomotion in humans.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.176
That's why, if there's a lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.696
this has dramatic effects.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.496
The person can become
paraplegic or tetraplegic.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.896
This is because the brain
loses this communication

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.176
with the spinal cord.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.416
Especially, it loses
this descending modulation

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.360
to initiate and modulate locomotion.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.336
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.736
is to be able to reactivate
that communication

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.200
using electrical or chemical stimulations.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.776
And there are several teams
in the world that do exactly that,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.016
especially at EPFL.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.536
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine
and Silvestro Micera,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.800
with whom I collaborate.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.056
But to do this properly,
it's very important to understand

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.816
how the spinal cord works,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.536
how it interacts with the body,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.040
and how the brain
communicates with the spinal cord.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.696
This is where the robots
and models that I've presented today

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.616
will hopefully play a key role

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.296
towards these very important goals.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.536
Thank you.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.120
(Applause)

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.736
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen
in your lab other robots

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.216
that do things like swim in pollution

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.696
and measure the pollution while they swim.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.936
But for this one,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.440
you mentioned in your talk,
like a side project,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.856
search and rescue,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.056
and it does have a camera on its nose.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.576
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.029
We have some spin-off projects

00:13:25.053 --> 00:13:28.496
where we would like to use the robots
to do search and rescue inspection,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.096
so this robot is now seeing you.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.296
And the big dream is to,
if you have a difficult situation

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.936
like a collapsed building
or a building that is flooded,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.296
and this is very dangerous
for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.216
why not send in a robot
that can crawl around, swim, walk,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.416
with a camera onboard
to do inspection and identify survivors

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.216
and possibly create
a communication link with the survivor.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.816
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors
don't get scared by the shape of this.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.136
AI: Yeah, we should probably
change the appearance quite a bit,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.976
because here I guess a survivor
might die of a heart attack

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.536
just of being worried
that this would feed on you.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.416
But by changing the appearance
and it making it more robust,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.496
I'm sure we can make
a good tool out of it.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.806
BG: Thank you very much.
Thank you and your team.
