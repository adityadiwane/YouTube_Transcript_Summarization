00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:15.222
When we think about prejudice and bias,

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:17.366
we tend to think about stupid and evil people

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.820
doing stupid and evil things.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.890
And this idea is nicely summarized

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.358
by the British critic William Hazlitt,

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.293
who wrote, "Prejudice is the child of ignorance."

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.405
I want to try to convince you here

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.040
that this is mistaken.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.772
I want to try to convince you

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:34.495
that prejudice and bias

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.783
are natural, they're often rational,

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:39.614
and they're often even moral,

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:41.866
and I think that once we understand this,

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.375
we're in a better position to make sense of them

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.432
when they go wrong,

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:47.200
when they have horrible consequences,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.525
and we're in a better position to know what to do

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:51.207
when this happens.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:54.234
So, start with stereotypes. You look at me,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.480
you know my name, you
know certain facts about me,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.309
and you could make certain judgments.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.162
You could make guesses about my ethnicity,

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:04.443
my political affiliation, my religious beliefs.

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:06.542
And the thing is, these
judgments tend to be accurate.

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:08.724
We're very good at this sort of thing.

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:10.207
And we're very good at this sort of thing

00:01:10.207 --> 00:01:12.940
because our ability to stereotype people

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.195
is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,

00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:18.511
but rather it's a specific instance

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.166
of a more general process,

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.785
which is that we have experience

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.326
with things and people in the world

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.575
that fall into categories,

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.031
and we can use our experience
to make generalizations

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:29.390
about novel instances of these categories.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.757
So everybody here has a lot of experience

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.010
with chairs and apples and dogs,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.646
and based on this, you could see

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:37.998
unfamiliar examples and you could guess,

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.314
you could sit on the chair,

00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:41.879
you could eat the apple, the dog will bark.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.643
Now we might be wrong.

00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:45.443
The chair could collapse if you sit on it,

00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:47.665
the apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:50.535
and in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn't bark.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.294
But for the most part, we're good at this.

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:55.210
For the most part, we make good guesses

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.024
both in the social domain and the non-social domain,

00:01:57.024 --> 00:01:58.973
and if we weren't able to do so,

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:02.189
if we weren't able to make guesses about
new instances that we encounter,

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.640
we wouldn't survive.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.509
And in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.994
concedes this.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.536
He writes, "Without the aid of prejudice and custom,

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:12.876
I should not be able to find
my way my across the room;

00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:15.328
nor know how to conduct
myself in any circumstances,

00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:19.531
nor what to feel in any relation of life."

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:21.040
Or take bias.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.748
Now sometimes, we break the world up into

00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:25.749
us versus them, into in-group versus out-group,

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:26.910
and sometimes when we do this,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.467
we know we're doing something wrong,

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.140
and we're kind of ashamed of it.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.623
But other times we're proud of it.

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:33.436
We openly acknowledge it.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:34.718
And my favorite example of this

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.120
is a question that came from the audience

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.837
in a Republican debate prior to the last election.

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:42.129
(Video) Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question,

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.310
the question in the hall, on foreign aid? Yes, ma'am.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.546
Woman: The American people are suffering

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:51.183
in our country right now.

00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:54.531
Why do we continue to send foreign aid

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:55.847
to other countries

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:59.950
when we need all the help we can get for ourselves?

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.645
AC: Governor Perry, what about that?

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:03.012
(Applause)

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.350
Rick Perry: Absolutely, I think it'sâ€”

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.010
Paul Bloom: Each of the people onstage

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.981
agreed with the premise of her question,

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.100
which is as Americans, we should care more

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.226
about Americans than about other people.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.091
And in fact, in general, people are often swayed

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.599
by feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.315
towards their country or towards their ethnic group.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:25.400
Regardless of your politics, many
people feel proud to be American,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.462
and they favor Americans over other countries.

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:30.312
Residents of other countries
feel the same about their nation,

00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:32.798
and we feel the same about our ethnicities.

00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:34.482
Now some of you may reject this.

00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:36.203
Some of you may be so cosmopolitan

00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:38.547
that you think that ethnicity and nationality

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:40.700
should hold no moral sway.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.462
But even you sophisticates accept

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:45.296
that there should be some pull

00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:47.997
towards the in-group in the
domain of friends and family,

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:49.418
of people you're close to,

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:50.979
and so even you make a distinction

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.954
between us versus them.

00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:55.557
Now, this distinction is natural enough

00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:58.481
and often moral enough, but it can go awry,

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:00.210
and this was part of the research

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.969
of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.574
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919.

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:07.713
He left to go to university in France,

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:10.268
because as a Jew, he couldn't
go to university in Poland,

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:12.778
and then he enlisted in the French military

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:14.061
in World War II.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:15.830
He was captured and ended up

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.361
in a prisoner of war camp,

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:19.628
and it was a terrifying time for him,

00:04:19.628 --> 00:04:21.316
because if it was discovered that he was a Jew,

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:23.408
he could have been moved to a concentration camp,

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:25.400
where he most likely would not have survived.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.987
And in fact, when the war
ended and he was released,

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:30.492
most of his friends and family were dead.

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:32.329
He got involved in different pursuits.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:33.860
He helped out the war orphans.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.591
But he had a long-lasting interest

00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.136
in the science of prejudice,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:39.796
and so when a prestigious British scholarship

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:41.641
on stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:42.998
and he won it,

00:04:42.998 --> 00:04:45.188
and then he began this amazing career.

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:47.937
And what started his career is an insight

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:49.777
that the way most people were thinking

00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:51.893
about the Holocaust was wrong.

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:54.299
Many people, most people at the time,

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:56.200
viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.204
some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:03.038
some genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:05.096
And Tajfel rejected this.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.639
Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.950
is just an exaggeration

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.728
of normal psychological processes

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.489
that exist in every one of us.

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:16.174
And to explore this, he did a series of classic studies

00:05:16.174 --> 00:05:17.918
with British adolescents.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.467
And in one of his studies, what he did was he asked

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:22.019
the British adolescents all sorts of questions,

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:23.903
and then based on their answers, he said,

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:26.260
"I've looked at your answers,
and based on the answers,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.357
I have determined that you are either" â€”

00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:29.363
he told half of them â€”

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:32.320
"a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.298
or a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee."

00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:37.114
It was entirely bogus.

00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:39.404
Their answers had nothing
to do with Kandinsky or Klee.

00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:42.132
They probably hadn't heard of the artists.

00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:44.872
He just arbitrarily divided them up.

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:48.143
But what he found was, these categories mattered,

00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:50.654
so when he later gave the subjects money,

00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:52.330
they would prefer to give the money

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.130
to members of their own group

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.963
than members of the other group.

00:05:55.963 --> 00:05:58.290
Worse, they were actually most interested

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.296
in establishing a difference

00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:02.862
between their group and other groups,

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.770
so they would give up money for their own group

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.018
if by doing so they could give
the other group even less.

00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:12.236
This bias seems to show up very early.

00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:14.536
So my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale

00:06:14.536 --> 00:06:16.147
has done a series of studies with babies

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:18.979
where she exposes babies to puppets,

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.244
and the puppets have certain food preferences.

00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:23.426
So one of the puppets might like green beans.

00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:26.001
The other puppet might like graham crackers.

00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.370
They test the babies own food preferences,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.060
and babies typically prefer the graham crackers.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.672
But the question is, does this matter to babies

00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:36.788
in how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.

00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:38.307
They tend to prefer the puppet

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:41.786
who has the same food tastes that they have,

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:44.342
and worse, they actually prefer puppets

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:47.327
who punish the puppet with the different food taste.

00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:49.604
(Laughter)

00:06:49.604 --> 00:06:53.236
We see this sort of in-group,
out-group psychology all the time.

00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:54.900
We see it in political clashes

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.314
within groups with different ideologies.

00:06:57.314 --> 00:07:00.940
We see it in its extreme in cases of war,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.157
where the out-group isn't merely given less,

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.745
but dehumanized,

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.985
as in the Nazi perspective of Jews

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:10.070
as vermin or lice,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.306
or the American perspective of Japanese as rats.

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:16.520
Stereotypes can also go awry.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.781
So often they're rational and useful,

00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:20.355
but sometimes they're irrational,

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:21.581
they give the wrong answers,

00:07:21.581 --> 00:07:22.798
and other times

00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:24.973
they lead to plainly immoral consequences.

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:27.781
And the case that's been most studied

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.448
is the case of race.

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:30.855
There was a fascinating study

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.929
prior to the 2008 election

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:35.955
where social psychologists looked at the extent

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.397
to which the candidates were
associated with America,

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:43.002
as in an unconscious association
with the American flag.

00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:44.358
And in one of their studies they compared

00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:46.372
Obama and McCain, and they found McCain

00:07:46.372 --> 00:07:49.766
is thought of as more American than Obama,

00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:52.339
and to some extent, people aren't 
that surprised by hearing that.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:54.257
McCain is a celebrated war hero,

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:55.916
and many people would explicitly say

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:58.616
he has more of an American story than Obama.

00:07:58.616 --> 00:08:00.553
But they also compared Obama

00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:03.069
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.330
and they found that Blair was also thought of

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.837
as more American than Obama,

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:09.910
even though subjects explicitly understood

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.900
that he's not American at all.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.324
But they were responding, of course,

00:08:14.324 --> 00:08:17.375
to the color of his skin.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.426
These stereotypes and biases

00:08:19.426 --> 00:08:20.876
have real-world consequences,

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.748
both subtle and very important.

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:26.410
In one recent study, researchers

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.679
put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:32.413
Some of them were held by white hands,

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:33.631
others by black hands.

00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:35.210
They were the same baseball cards.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.454
The ones held by black hands

00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:38.521
got substantially smaller bids

00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:41.005
than the ones held by white hands.

00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:43.367
In research done at Stanford,

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:47.597
psychologists explored the case of people

00:08:47.597 --> 00:08:51.166
sentenced for the murder of a white person.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.970
It turns out, holding everything else constant,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.340
you are considerably more likely to be executed

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.117
if you look like the man on the right

00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.090
than the man on the left,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.119
and this is in large part because

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:04.653
the man on the right looks more prototypically black,

00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:07.283
more prototypically African-American,

00:09:07.283 --> 00:09:09.332
and this apparently influences people's decisions

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:11.103
over what to do about him.

00:09:11.103 --> 00:09:12.650
So now that we know about this,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.307
how do we combat it?

00:09:14.307 --> 00:09:15.929
And there are different avenues.

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:17.363
One avenue is to appeal

00:09:17.363 --> 00:09:19.409
to people's emotional responses,

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:21.542
to appeal to people's empathy,

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:23.415
and we often do that through stories.

00:09:23.415 --> 00:09:25.980
So if you are a liberal parent

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.852
and you want to encourage your children

00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:30.226
to believe in the merits of nontraditional families,

00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:32.499
you might give them a book like this.
["Heather Has Two Mommies"]

00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:34.225
If you are conservative and have a different attitude,

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:36.156
you might give them a book like this.

00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:37.905
(Laughter)
["Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!"]

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:41.241
But in general, stories can turn

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:43.473
anonymous strangers into people who matter,

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:46.158
and the idea that we care about people

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:47.860
when we focus on them as individuals

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.139
is an idea which has shown up across history.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.722
So Stalin apocryphally said,

00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.339
"A single death is a tragedy,

00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:56.379
a million deaths is a statistic,"

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:57.830
and Mother Teresa said,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.371
"If I look at the mass, I will never act.

00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.696
If I look at the one, I will."

00:10:01.696 --> 00:10:03.766
Psychologists have explored this.

00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:05.067
For instance, in one study,

00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:07.850
people were given a list of facts about a crisis,

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.106
and it was seen how much they would donate

00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:13.690
to solve this crisis,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.527
and another group was given no facts at all

00:10:15.527 --> 00:10:17.625
but they were told of an individual

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:20.065
and given a name and given a face,

00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:23.284
and it turns out that they gave far more.

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:25.145
None of this I think is a secret

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.256
to the people who are engaged in charity work.

00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:29.904
People don't tend to deluge people

00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:31.227
with facts and statistics.

00:10:31.227 --> 00:10:32.249
Rather, you show them faces,

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:33.985
you show them people.

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:37.212
It's possible that by extending our sympathies

00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:39.183
to an individual, they can spread

00:10:39.183 --> 00:10:42.061
to the group that the individual belongs to.

00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:44.527
This is Harriet Beecher Stowe.

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:46.970
The story, perhaps apocryphal,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.044
is that President Lincoln invited her

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:51.042
to the White House in the middle of the Civil War

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.626
and said to her,

00:10:52.626 --> 00:10:55.290
"So you're the little lady who started this great war."

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.175
And he was talking about "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

00:10:57.175 --> 00:10:59.706
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is not
a great book of philosophy

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:02.850
or of theology or perhaps not even literature,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.365
but it does a great job

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.863
of getting people to put themselves in the shoes

00:11:07.863 --> 00:11:10.196
of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of,

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:12.598
put themselves in the shoes of slaves.

00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:14.379
And that could well have been a catalyst

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:15.983
for great social change.

00:11:15.983 --> 00:11:18.345
More recently, looking at America

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.414
in the last several decades,

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:24.563
there's some reason to believe
that shows like "The Cosby Show"

00:11:24.563 --> 00:11:27.251
radically changed American attitudes
towards African-Americans,

00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:30.234
while shows like "Will and Grace" and "Modern Family"

00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:31.597
changed American attitudes

00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:32.897
towards gay men and women.

00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:35.352
I don't think it's an exaggeration to say

00:11:35.352 --> 00:11:38.013
that the major catalyst in America for moral change

00:11:38.013 --> 00:11:40.906
has been a situation comedy.

00:11:40.906 --> 00:11:42.322
But it's not all emotions,

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:43.598
and I want to end by appealing

00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:45.833
to the power of reason.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:47.989
At some point in his wonderful book

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:49.212
"The Better Angels of Our Nature,"

00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:51.228
Steven Pinker says,

00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:53.810
the Old Testament says love thy neighbor,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.532
and the New Testament says love thy enemy,

00:11:56.532 --> 00:11:59.218
but I don't love either one of them, not really,

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:00.885
but I don't want to kill them.

00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:02.751
I know I have obligations to them,

00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:06.221
but my moral feelings to them, my moral beliefs

00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:07.934
about how I should behave towards them,

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.981
aren't grounded in love.

00:12:09.981 --> 00:12:11.920
What they're grounded in is the
understanding of human rights,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.143
a belief that their life is as valuable to them

00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:16.499
as my life is to me,

00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:18.431
and to support this, he tells a story

00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.279
by the great philosopher Adam Smith,

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.965
and I want to tell this story too,

00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:23.261
though I'm going to modify it a little bit

00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:24.939
for modern times.

00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:26.840
So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.741
the death of thousands of people,

00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:30.781
and imagine that the thousands of people

00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:33.020
are in a country you are not familiar with.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.574
It could be China or India or a country in Africa.

00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:39.058
And Smith says, how would you respond?

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.365
And you would say, well that's too bad,

00:12:41.365 --> 00:12:43.241
and you'd go on to the rest of your life.

00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.460
If you were to open up The New
York Times online or something,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.420
and discover this, and in fact
this happens to us all the time,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.941
we go about our lives.

00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:52.135
But imagine instead, Smith says,

00:12:52.135 --> 00:12:53.389
you were to learn that tomorrow

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:55.928
you were to have your little finger chopped off.

00:12:55.928 --> 00:12:58.097
Smith says, that would matter a lot.

00:12:58.097 --> 00:12:59.508
You would not sleep that night

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:00.861
wondering about that.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.880
So this raises the question:

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.346
Would you sacrifice thousands of lives

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:07.315
to save your little finger?

00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:09.633
Now answer this in the privacy of your own head,

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:12.552
but Smith says, absolutely not,

00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:14.244
what a horrid thought.

00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:16.275
And so this raises the question,

00:13:16.275 --> 00:13:17.649
and so, as Smith puts it,

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:19.867
"When our passive feelings are almost always

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.315
so sordid and so selfish,

00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:22.780
how comes it that our active principles

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.313
should often be so generous and so noble?"

00:13:25.313 --> 00:13:27.363
And Smith's answer is, "It is reason,

00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:29.138
principle, conscience.

00:13:29.138 --> 00:13:30.679
[This] calls to us,

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:34.104
with a voice capable of astonishing
the most presumptuous of our passions,

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.781
that we are but one of the multitude,

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:38.222
in no respect better than any other in it."

00:13:38.222 --> 00:13:40.347
And this last part is what is often described

00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:43.555
as the principle of impartiality.

00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:46.184
And this principle of impartiality manifests itself

00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:47.931
in all of the world's religions,

00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:50.209
in all of the different versions of the golden rule,

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:52.663
and in all of the world's moral philosophies,

00:13:52.663 --> 00:13:53.970
which differ in many ways

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.964
but share the presupposition
that we should judge morality

00:13:56.964 --> 00:13:59.949
from sort of an impartial point of view.

00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:01.771
The best articulation of this view

00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:04.856
is actually, for me, it's not from
a theologian or from a philosopher,

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:06.213
but from Humphrey Bogart

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:07.760
at the end of "Casablanca."

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.536
So, spoiler alert, he's telling his lover

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:12.676
that they have to separate

00:14:12.676 --> 00:14:14.269
for the more general good,

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.133
and he says to her, and I won't do the accent,

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.915
but he says to her, "It doesn't take much to see

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.274
that the problems of three little people

00:14:19.274 --> 00:14:22.385
don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."

00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:25.665
Our reason could cause us to override our passions.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.381
Our reason could motivate us

00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:28.602
to extend our empathy,

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.929
could motivate us to write a
book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:32.652
or read a book like "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"

00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:35.346
and our reason can motivate us to create

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:37.308
customs and taboos and laws

00:14:37.308 --> 00:14:39.118
that will constrain us

00:14:39.118 --> 00:14:40.794
from acting upon our impulses

00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:42.383
when, as rational beings, we feel

00:14:42.383 --> 00:14:43.778
we should be constrained.

00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:45.791
This is what a constitution is.

00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:48.712
A constitution is something
which was set up in the past

00:14:48.712 --> 00:14:50.019
that applies now in the present,

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.004
and what it says is,

00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:53.231
no matter how much we might to reelect

00:14:53.231 --> 00:14:55.834
a popular president for a third term,

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:57.929
no matter how much white Americans might choose

00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:01.997
to feel that they want to reinstate
the institution of slavery, we can't.

00:15:01.997 --> 00:15:03.673
We have bound ourselves.

00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:06.090
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.848
We know that when it comes to choosing somebody

00:15:08.848 --> 00:15:11.799
for a job, for an award,

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:14.757
we are strongly biased by their race,

00:15:14.757 --> 00:15:17.053
we are biased by their gender,

00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:19.268
we are biased by how attractive they are,

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:21.919
and sometimes we might say,
"Well fine, that's the way it should be."

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:24.226
But other times we say, "This is wrong."

00:15:24.226 --> 00:15:26.115
And so to combat this,

00:15:26.115 --> 00:15:28.366
we don't just try harder,

00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:31.367
but rather what we do is we set up situations

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:34.406
where these other sources
of information can't bias us,

00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:35.721
which is why many orchestras

00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:38.366
audition musicians behind screens,

00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:39.610
so the only information they have

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.303
is the information they believe should matter.

00:15:42.303 --> 00:15:44.626
I think prejudice and bias

00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:47.720
illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.496
We have gut feelings, instincts, emotions,

00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:53.657
and they affect our judgments and our actions

00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:55.988
for good and for evil,

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:59.610
but we are also capable of rational deliberation

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.045
and intelligent planning,

00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:03.862
and we can use these to, in some cases,

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:05.805
accelerate and nourish our emotions,

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:08.573
and in other cases staunch them.

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:09.807
And it's in this way

00:16:09.807 --> 00:16:12.574
that reason helps us create a better world.

00:16:12.574 --> 00:16:14.918
Thank you.

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:18.623
