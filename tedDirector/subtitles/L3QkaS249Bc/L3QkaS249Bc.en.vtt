00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I got my start

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in writing and research

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
as a surgical trainee,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
as someone who was a long ways away

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
So the natural question you ask then at that point

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And it became a question of,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
how do we all get good

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
at what we're trying to do?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
try to learn all the material you have to absorb

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
at any task you're taking on.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
but then also how I pick the right person

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to come to an operating room.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And then in the midst of all this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
came this new context

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
for thinking about what it meant to be good.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
In the last few years

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
we realized we were in the deepest crisis

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of medicine's existence

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
due to something you don't normally think about

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
when you're a doctor

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
concerned with how you do good for people,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
which is the cost

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
of health care.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
There's not a country in the world

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
that now is not asking

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
whether we can afford what doctors do.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
The political fight that we've developed

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
has become one around

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
whether it's the government that's the problem

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
or is it insurance companies that are the problem.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And the answer is yes and no;

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it's deeper than all of that.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
The cause of our troubles

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is actually the complexity that science has given us.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And in order to understand this,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
I want to take you back

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
one of my favorite writers.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
what it was like to be a medical intern

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
at the Boston City Hospital

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
in the pre-penicillin year

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
of 1937.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
It was a time when medicine was cheap

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and very ineffective.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
If you were in a hospital, he said,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
it was going to do you good

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
only because it offered you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
some warmth, some food, shelter,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and maybe the caring attention

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of a nurse.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Doctors and medicine

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
made no difference at all.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
That didn't seem to prevent the doctors

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
from being frantically busy in their days,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
as he explained.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
What they were trying to do

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
for which they could do something.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And there were a few.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and they could give you an antiserum,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
an injection of rabid antibodies

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
to the bacterium streptococcus,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
if the intern sub-typed it correctly.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If you had an acute congestive heart failure,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
they could bleed a pint of blood from you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
by opening up an arm vein,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and then giving you oxygen by tent.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
If you had early signs of paralysis

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and you were really good at asking personal questions,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
you might figure out

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
in which case you could give this nice concoction

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.260
of mercury and arsenic --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Beyond these sorts of things,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
This was when the core structure of medicine

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
was created --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
what it meant to be good at what we did

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and how we wanted to build medicine to be.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
It was at a time

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
when what was known you could know,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
If you had a prescription pad,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
if you had a nurse,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
if you had a hospital

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
you really could do it all.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
You set the fracture, you drew the blood,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
you spun the blood,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
looked at it under the microscope,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.260
This was a life as a craftsman.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
As a result, we built it around

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
a culture and set of values

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that said what you were good at

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
was being daring,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
at being courageous,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.260
at being independent and self-sufficient.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Autonomy was our highest value.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Go a couple generations forward

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to where we are, though,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and it looks like a completely different world.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
We have now found treatments

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.260
for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that a human being can have.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
We can't cure it all.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
But we can make it possible

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
for most.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
But what does it take?

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Well, we've now discovered

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
4,000 medical and surgical procedures.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
We've discovered 6,000 drugs

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
that I'm now licensed to prescribe.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
And we're trying to deploy this capability,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
town by town,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
to every person alive --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
in our own country,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
let alone around the world.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And we've reached the point where we've realized,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
as doctors,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
we can't know it all.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
We can't do it all

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
by ourselves.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
There was a study where they looked

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
at how many clinicians it took to take care of you

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
if you came into a hospital,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
as it changed over time.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
And in the year 1970,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
That is to say,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
it took basically the nursing time

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and then just a little bit of time for a doctor

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
who more or less checked in on you

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
once a day.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
By the end of the 20th century,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
it had become more than 15 clinicians

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
for the same typical hospital patient --

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
specialists, physical therapists,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
the nurses.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
We're all specialists now,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
even the primary care physicians.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Everyone just has

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
a piece of the care.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But holding onto that structure we built

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
around the daring, independence,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
self-sufficiency

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
of each of those people

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
has become a disaster.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We have trained, hired and rewarded people

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
to be cowboys.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
But it's pit crews that we need,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
pit crews for patients.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
There's evidence all around us:

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
in our communities

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
60 percent

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
of our asthma, stroke patients

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Two million people come into hospitals

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and pick up an infection

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
they didn't have

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
because someone failed to follow

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
the basic practices of hygiene.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Our experience

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
as people who get sick,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
need help from other people,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
is that we have amazing clinicians

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
that we can turn to --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that we have access to incredible technologies

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
that give us great hope,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
but little sense

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
that it consistently all comes together for you

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
from start to finish

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
in a successful way.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
There's another sign

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
that we need pit crews,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and that's the unmanageable cost

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
of our care.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Now we in medicine, I think,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
are baffled by this question of cost.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We want to say, "This is just the way it is.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
This is just what medicine requires."

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
When you go from a world

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
where you treated arthritis with aspirin,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that mostly didn't do the job,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
to one where, if it gets bad enough,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
that gives you years, maybe decades,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
without disability,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
a dramatic change,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
well is it any surprise

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that that $40,000 hip replacement

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
replacing the 10-cent aspirin

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is more expensive?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
It's just the way it is.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
But I think we're ignoring certain facts

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that tell us something about what we can do.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
As we've looked at the data

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
about the results that have come

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
as the complexity has increased,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
we found

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
that the most expensive care

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
is not necessarily the best care.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And vice versa,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
the best care

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
often turns out to be the least expensive --

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
has fewer complications,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
the people get more efficient at what they do.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And what that means

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
is there's hope.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Because [if] to have the best results,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
you really needed the most expensive care

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
in the country, or in the world,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
well then we really would be talking about rationing

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.260
who we're going to cut off from Medicare.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
That would be really our only choice.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
But when we look at the positive deviants --

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
the ones who are getting the best results

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
at the lowest costs --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
we find the ones that look the most like systems

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
are the most successful.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
That is to say, they found ways

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
to get all of the different pieces,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
all of the different components,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
to come together into a whole.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Having great components is not enough,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
We want the best drugs, the best technologies,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
the best specialists,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
but we don't think too much

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
about how it all comes together.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.260
It's a terrible design strategy actually.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
There's a famous thought experiment

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
that touches exactly on this

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
that said, what if you built a car

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
from the very best car parts?

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
a Ferrari engine,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And you put it all together and what do you get?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.260
And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
It's not a system.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Now a system, however,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
when things start to come together,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
you realize it has certain skills

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
for acting and looking that way.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Skill number one

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
is the ability to recognize success

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and the ability to recognize failure.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
When you are a specialist,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
you can't see the end result very well.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
You have to become really interested in data,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
unsexy as that sounds.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and he got interested in the question of,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
well how many CT scans did they do

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
for their community in Cedar Rapids?

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
He got interested in this

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
because there had been government reports,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
newspaper reports, journal articles

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
saying that there had been too many CT scans done.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
He didn't see it in his own patients.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and he wanted to get the data.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
It took him three months.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
No one had asked this question in his community before.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And what he found was that,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
for the 300,000 people in their community,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
in the previous year

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.260
they had done 52,000 CT scans.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
They had found a problem.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.260
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Skill one, find where your failures are.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Skill two is devise solutions.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
I got interested in this

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
when the World Health Organization came to my team

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
asking if we could help with a project

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
to reduce deaths in surgery.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
The volume of surgery had spread

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
around the world,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
but the safety of surgery

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
had not.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
are to do more training,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
give people more specialization

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
or bring in more technology.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Well in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and you couldn't have people who are better trained.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And yet we see unconscionable levels

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.260
of death, disability

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
that could be avoided.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
We looked at skyscraper construction,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
we looked at the aviation world,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and we found

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
that they have technology, they have training,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and then they have one other thing:

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
They have checklists.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
I did not expect

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
to be spending a significant part

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
of my time as a Harvard surgeon

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
worrying about checklists.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And yet, what we found

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
were that these were tools

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to help make experts better.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.260
We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Could we design a checklist for surgery?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
but for the folks

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
who were all the way around the chain,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
the entire team including the surgeons.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And what they taught us

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
was that designing a checklist

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
to help people handle complexity

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
You have to think about things

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
like pause points.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
You need to identify the moments in a process

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and do something about it.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
You have to identify

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
that this is a before-takeoff checklist.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And then you need to focus on the killer items.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
An aviation checklist,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
like this one for a single-engine plane,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
it's a reminder of the key things

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
that get forgotten or missed

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
if they're not checked.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
So we did this.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
We created a 19-item two-minute checklist

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
for surgical teams.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
We had the pause points

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
immediately before anesthesia is given,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
immediately before the knife hits the skin,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
immediately before the patient leaves the room.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there --

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
because that cuts the infection rate by half --

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and then interesting stuff,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Instead, you can make a recipe

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
because you get half a dozen people or more

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
who are sometimes coming together as a team

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
for the very first time that day that you're coming in.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
We implemented this checklist

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
in eight hospitals around the world,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
deliberately in places from rural Tanzania

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
to the University of Washington in Seattle.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
We found that after they adopted it

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
the complication rates fell

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
35 percent.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
It fell in every hospital it went into.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
The death rates fell

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
47 percent.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
This was bigger than a drug.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:38.260
(Applause)

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And that brings us

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
to skill number three,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
the ability to implement this,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
to get colleagues across the entire chain

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
to actually do these things.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And it's been slow to spread.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.260
This is not yet our norm in surgery --

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
let alone making checklists

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
to go onto childbirth and other areas.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
There's a deep resistance

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
because using these tools

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
forces us to confront

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
that we're not a system,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
forces us to behave with a different set of values.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
Just using a checklist

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.260
like humility,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
discipline,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
teamwork.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
This is the opposite of what we were built on:

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
independence, self-sufficiency,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
autonomy.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
I met an actual cowboy, by the way.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
I asked him, what was it like

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
to actually herd a thousand cattle

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
across hundreds of miles?

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
How did you do that?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
And he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
They communicate electronically constantly,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
and they have protocols and checklists

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
for how they handle everything --

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
(Laughter)

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
-- from bad weather

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.260
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
And it seemed like time

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
that we become that way ourselves.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
Making systems work

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
is the great task of my generation

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
of physicians and scientists.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
But I would go further and say

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
that making systems work,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
whether in health care, education,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
climate change,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
making a pathway out of poverty,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.260
is the great task of our generation as a whole.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
In every field, knowledge has exploded,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
but it has brought complexity,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
it has brought specialization.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
And we've come to a place where we have no choice

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
but to recognize,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.260
as individualistic as we want to be,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
complexity requires

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
group success.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.260
We all need to be pit crews now.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
Thank you.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:13.260
(Applause)
