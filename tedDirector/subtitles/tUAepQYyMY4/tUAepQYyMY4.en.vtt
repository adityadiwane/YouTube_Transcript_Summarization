00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The anger in me against corruption

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
made me to make a big career change

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
My experiences over the last 18 months,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
as a lawyer, has seeded in me

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
a new entrepreneurial idea,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
which I believe is indeed

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
worth spreading.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
So, I share it with all of you here today,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
though the idea itself is getting crystallized

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and I'm still writing up the business plan.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Of course it helps that fear of public failure

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
diminishes as the number of ideas

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
which have failed increases.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
since 1993.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I've explored, experienced,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and experimented enterprise

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and capitalism to my heart's content.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I built, along with my two brothers,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and then worked professionally

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
with two of India's biggest businessmen,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
but in their startup enterprises.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.260
In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to work on so-called social sector issues,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I definitely did not have any grand strategy

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
or plan to pursue and find

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
for-profit solutions

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
to addressing pressing public issues.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
When life brought about a series

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
of death and near-death experiences

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
within my close circle,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
which highlighted the need

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
for an emergency medical response service in India,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
similar to 911 in USA.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
To address this, I, along with four friends,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
founded Ambulance Access for All,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
to promote life-support ambulance services in India.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
For those from the developing world,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
But as we envisioned it,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we had three key goals:

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Providing world-class life support ambulance service

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and universally accessible

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to anyone in a medical emergency,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
irrespective of the capability to pay.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
The service which grew out of this,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Dial 1298 for Ambulance,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
with one ambulance in 2004,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and has transported over 100,000 patients

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and victims since inception.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
The service is -- (Applause)

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
without accessing any public funds,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and the cross-subsidy model actually works,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
The service responded effectively

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and efficiently,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
during the unfortunate

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And as you can see from the visuals,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
the service was responding and rescuing

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
victims from the incident locations

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
even before the police could cordon off

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
the incident locations

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and formally confirm it as a terror strike.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
We ended up being the first medical response team

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
in every incident location

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and transported 125 victims,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
saving life.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.260
(Applause)

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.260
In tribute and remembrance

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
of 26/11 attacks

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
over the last one year,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Aman Foundation,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.260
(Applause)

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
It's a small message from us,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in our own small way

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to the enemies of humanity,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
of Islam, of South Asia,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
of India, and of Pakistan,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
that humanity will continue to bloom,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
irrespective of such dastardly attacks.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
One is Education Access for All,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
setting up schools in small-town India.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
which is integrating rural supply chain

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.260
on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Because diligent investors and venture funds

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
With the significance being these funds have come in

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.260
as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
that I'm exploring.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
You may be surprised to know

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
that eight speakers yesterday

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
actually mentioned these terms in their talks.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
with the supply side being mostly of

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
greedy corporate unethical businesses

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and hapless common man.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And the demand side being mostly politicians,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
vested with them.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
According to World Bank estimate,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
one trillion dollars is paid in bribes

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
every year, worsening the condition

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
of the already worse off.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Yet, if you analyze the common man,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
he or she does not wake up every day and say,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
that leads him to pay a bribe.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
In the modern day world, where time is premium

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
the hapless common man

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.260
simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Now, let me ask you another question.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
in your day-to-day life to get something done.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
What do you do? Of course you can call the police.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.260
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
But you also don't have the time, resources,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
expertise or wherewithal to fight this.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Unfortunately, many of us in this room

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.260
are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Yet the market forces around the world

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Like a bribe buster service,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
or www.stopbribes.org or

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
www.preventcorruption.org.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Such a service simply do not exist.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
One image that has haunted me

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
from my early business days

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
All she needed was permission to build three steps

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to her house, from ground level,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
for want of a bribe.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Even though it pricked my conscience then,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I could not, or rather I did not

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
tend to her or assist her,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
because I was busy building my real estate company.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to address individual instances of demands

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
for bribes for common services or entitlement.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
using existing and legitimate tools

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
like the Right to Information Act,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
video, audio, or peer pressure,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
we have successfully obtained whatever our clients

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
than the bribe demanded.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
can be consolidated in standard processes

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
in a BPO kind of environment,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and made available on web, call-center

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
and franchise physical offices,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.260
for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
The target market is as tempting as it can get.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
being paid in bribes every year,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
or equal to India's GDP.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And it is an absolutely virgin market.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I propose to explore this idea further,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
to examine the potential of creating

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.260
a for-profit, fee-based BPO

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
kind of service to stop bribes

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and prevent corruption.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
I do realize that the fight for justice

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
against corruption is never easy.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It never has been and it never will be.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
In my last 18 months as a lawyer,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
battling small- and large-scale corruption,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.260
including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Through his charities

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
I have had three police cases filed against me

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
The battle against corruption

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
exacts a toll on ourselves,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.260
our families, our friends, and even our kids.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.260
to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
What gives us the courage?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
As my close friend replied, when told

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
during the seeding days of the ambulance project

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that it is an impossible task

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
at least in our own minds.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
For we are insane people,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
trying to do an impossible task.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:31.260
(Applause)

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
(Laughter)

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260
CA: What's on your mind?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260
SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Somebody who had applied for the passport.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
The officer was just sitting on it

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And he did not want to pay.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So we actually used the Right to Information Act,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and pushed back the officers in this particular case.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And in all these 42 cases,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
when we kept pushing them back,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
there was three kinds of reaction.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
A set of people actually say,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Some people actually come back and say,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And he will push us back.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.260
So you take the next step, or use the next tool available

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
in what we are putting together,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and then he relents.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.260
CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
what fee would you have to charge,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and can you actually make the business work?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
was less than 200 rupees.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
So, it actually works.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
(Laughter)

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.260
CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
I mean, this could be huge.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
(Applause)
