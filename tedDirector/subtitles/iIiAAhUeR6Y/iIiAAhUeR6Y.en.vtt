00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:27.976
I think I was supposed
to talk about my new book,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.879
which is called "Blink,"

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.647
and it's about snap judgments
and first impressions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.791
And it comes out in January,
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.289
(Laughter)

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:39.976
But I was thinking about this,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.210
and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.870
and I think would make my mother happy,

00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:49.352
it's not really about happiness.

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:52.976
So I decided instead,
I would talk about someone

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.679
who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:59.976
as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
a man who is a great
personal hero of mine:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.100
who is most famous
for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:14.976
Howard's about this high, and he's round,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.089
and he's in his 60s,
and he has big huge glasses

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.906
and thinning gray hair,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.754
and he has a kind of wonderful
exuberance and vitality,

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.786
and he has a parrot,
and he loves the opera,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.901
and he's a great aficionado
of medieval history.

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:35.807
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.

00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:40.468
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea
what psychophysics is,

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:42.182
although at some point in my life,

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.652
I dated a girl for two years

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.916
who was getting
her doctorate in psychophysics.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.484
Which should tell you something
about that relationship.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.805
(Laughter)

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.976
As far as I know, psychophysics
is about measuring things.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.631
And Howard is very interested
in measuring things.

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.028
And he graduated
with his doctorate from Harvard,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.300
and he set up a little consulting shop
in White Plains, New York.

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:06.413
And one of his first clients was Pepsi.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:09.515
This is many years ago,
back in the early 70s.

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.356
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.778
"You know, there's this new
thing called aspartame,

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.686
and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.687
We'd like you to figure out

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:22.217
how much aspartame we should put
in each can of Diet Pepsi

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.998
in order to have the perfect drink."

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.976
Now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.477
and that's what Howard thought.

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:31.802
Because Pepsi told him,

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:34.509
"We're working with a band
between eight and 12 percent.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.452
Anything below eight percent
sweetness is not sweet enough;

00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:40.715
anything above 12 percent
sweetness is too sweet.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.822
We want to know: what's the sweet
spot between 8 and 12?"

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:48.333
Now, if I gave you this problem to do,
you would all say, it's very simple.

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:51.976
What we do is you make up
a big experimental batch of Pepsi,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.486
at every degree of sweetness --
eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.791
all the way up to 12 --

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.304
and we try this out
with thousands of people,

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:02.534
and we plot the results on a curve,

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.539
and we take the most popular
concentration, right?

00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:06.818
Really simple.

00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:09.382
Howard does the experiment,
and he gets the data back,

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:10.747
and he plots it on a curve,

00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:13.635
and all of a sudden he realizes
it's not a nice bell curve.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.613
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.

00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:17.419
It's a mess. It's all over the place.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.613
Now, most people in that business,
in the world of testing food and such,

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:25.454
are not dismayed
when the data comes back a mess.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:26.970
They think, "Well, you know,

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:29.828
figuring out what people think
about cola's not that easy."

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:32.677
"You know, maybe we made an error
somewhere along the way."

00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:34.898
"You know, let's just
make an educated guess,"

00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.307
and they simply point
and they go for 10 percent,

00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.406
right in the middle.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.976
Howard is not so easily placated.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.912
Howard is a man of a certain degree
of intellectual standards.

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.976
And this was not good enough for him,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.282
and this question bedeviled him for years.

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:50.976
And he would think it through
and say, "What was wrong?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.685
Why could we not make sense
of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.976
And one day, he was sitting
in a diner in White Plains,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
about to go trying to dream up
some work for Nescafé.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:04.820
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,
the answer came to him.

00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:07.827
And that is, that when they analyzed
the Diet Pepsi data,

00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:09.573
they were asking the wrong question.

00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:11.727
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.714
and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsis.

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:16.825
Trust me.

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.976
This was an enormous revelation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.675
This was one of the most brilliant
breakthroughs in all of food science.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.417
Howard immediately went on the road,

00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:26.799
and he would go to conferences
around the country,

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:28.381
and he would stand up and say,

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.468
"You had been looking
for the perfect Pepsi.

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:31.722
You're wrong.

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:34.254
You should be looking
for the perfect Pepsis."

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.293
And people would look at him
blankly and say,

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.380
"What are you talking about? Craziness."

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.976
And they would say, "Move! Next!"

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.214
Tried to get business,
nobody would hire him --

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:44.622
he was obsessed, though,

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:46.653
and he talked about it
and talked about it.

00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.470
Howard loves the Yiddish expression

00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:50.976
"To a worm in horseradish,
the world is horseradish."

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.141
This was his horseradish.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:54.827
(Laughter)

00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:56.290
He was obsessed with it!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.811
And finally, he had a breakthrough.

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:01.976
Vlasic Pickles came to him,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.649
and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz,
we want to make the perfect pickle."

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:07.697
And he said,

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:10.650
"There is no perfect pickle;
there are only perfect pickles."

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:13.101
And he came back to them and he said,

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.335
"You don't just need
to improve your regular;

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:16.852
you need to create zesty."

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.701
And that's where we got zesty pickles.

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:21.976
Then the next person came to him:
Campbell's Soup.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And this was even more important.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:27.070
In fact, Campbell's Soup
is where Howard made his reputation.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.813
Campbell's made Prego,

00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:32.705
and Prego, in the early 80s,
was struggling next to Ragù,

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.094
which was the dominant
spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:39.389
In the industry -- I don't
know whether you care about this,

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:41.413
or how much time I have to go into this.

00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:44.067
But it was, technically speaking
-- this is an aside --

00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:46.151
Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:48.456
The quality of the tomato paste
is much better;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.300
the spice mix is far superior;

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:52.810
it adheres to the pasta
in a much more pleasing way.

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:54.911
In fact, they would do
the famous bowl test

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:57.580
back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:01.096
You'd have a plate of spaghetti,
and you would pour it on, right?

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.105
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,
and the Prego would sit on top.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.660
That's called "adherence."

00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:12.224
And, anyway, despite the fact
that they were far superior in adherence,

00:06:12.248 --> 00:06:15.019
and the quality of their tomato paste,

00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:16.412
Prego was struggling.

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:19.438
So they came to Howard,
and they said, fix us.

00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:22.310
And Howard looked
at their product line, and he said,

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:25.437
what you have is a dead tomato society.

00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:28.365
So he said, this is what I want to do.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.945
And he got together
with the Campbell's soup kitchen,

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.430
and he made 45 varieties
of spaghetti sauce.

00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:37.307
And he varied them according
to every conceivable way

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:38.976
that you can vary tomato sauce:

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.858
by sweetness, by level of garlic,

00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:44.097
by tomatoey-ness,
by tartness, by sourness,

00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:45.461
by visible solids --

00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:48.746
my favorite term
in the spaghetti sauce business.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.771
(Laughter)

00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:53.333
Every conceivable way
you can vary spaghetti sauce,

00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:55.136
he varied spaghetti sauce.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.893
And then he took this whole raft
of 45 spaghetti sauces,

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.074
and he went on the road.

00:07:00.098 --> 00:07:01.977
He went to New York, to Chicago,

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:03.930
he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.

00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:07.716
And he brought in people
by the truckload into big halls.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.465
And he sat them down for two hours,

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.816
and over the course of that two hours,
he gave them ten bowls.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.098
Ten small bowls of pasta,

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.580
with a different spaghetti
sauce on each one.

00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:21.331
And after they ate each bowl,
they had to rate, from 0 to 100,

00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:23.976
how good they thought
the spaghetti sauce was.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.561
At the end of that process,
after doing it for months and months,

00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.128
he had a mountain of data

00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:32.976
about how the American people
feel about spaghetti sauce.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.467
And then he analyzed the data.

00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:38.468
Did he look for the most popular
variety of spaghetti sauce?

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:41.246
No! Howard doesn't believe
that there is such a thing.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.333
Instead, he looked
at the data, and he said,

00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:48.976
let's see if we can group all these
different data points into clusters.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.452
Let's see if they congregate
around certain ideas.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.205
And sure enough, if you sit down,

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:57.794
and you analyze all this data
on spaghetti sauce,

00:07:57.818 --> 00:08:00.928
you realize that all Americans
fall into one of three groups.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.253
There are people
who like their spaghetti sauce plain;

00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:06.976
there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.244
and there are people
who like it extra chunky.

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:13.976
And of those three facts,
the third one was the most significant,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.654
because at the time, in the early 1980s,

00:08:16.678 --> 00:08:18.178
if you went to a supermarket,

00:08:18.202 --> 00:08:21.517
you would not find
extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.

00:08:21.987 --> 00:08:24.000
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:26.721
"You're telling me
that one third of Americans

00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:29.976
crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.499
and yet no one is servicing their needs?"

00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:33.547
And he said "Yes!"

00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:34.863
(Laughter)

00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:36.229
And Prego then went back,

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:38.625
and completely reformulated
their spaghetti sauce,

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:42.303
and came out with a line of extra chunky
that immediately and completely

00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:45.311
took over the spaghetti sauce
business in this country.

00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:49.738
And over the next 10 years,
they made 600 million dollars

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.159
off their line of extra-chunky sauces.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.490
Everyone else in the industry looked
at what Howard had done, and they said,

00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:58.921
"Oh my god! We've been
thinking all wrong!"

00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:02.215
And that's when you started to get
seven different kinds of vinegar,

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:07.705
and 14 different kinds of mustard,
and 71 different kinds of olive oil.

00:09:07.729 --> 00:09:10.976
And then eventually
even Ragù hired Howard,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.191
and Howard did the exact same thing
for Ragù that he did for Prego.

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:16.566
And today, if you go
to a really good supermarket,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.733
do you know how many Ragùs there are?

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:19.757
36!

00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:22.537
In six varieties:

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.611
Cheese, Light,

00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:28.737
Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty,

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:30.071
Old World Traditional --

00:09:32.483 --> 00:09:34.200
Extra-Chunky Garden.

00:09:34.224 --> 00:09:35.976
(Laughter)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.744
That's Howard's doing.

00:09:37.768 --> 00:09:39.976
That is Howard's gift
to the American people.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.681
Now why is that important?

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:43.976
(Laughter)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.081
It is, in fact, enormously important.

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.475
I'll explain to you why.

00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:51.620
What Howard did is he fundamentally
changed the way the food industry thinks

00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:53.065
about making you happy.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.976
Assumption number one
in the food industry used to be

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.700
that the way to find out
what people want to eat,

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.061
what will make people happy,
is to ask them.

00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:04.286
And for years and years and years,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.548
Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:09.032
and they would sit you down,
and they would say,

00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:10.929
"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:13.028
Tell us what you want
in a spaghetti sauce."

00:10:13.052 --> 00:10:15.976
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.976
through all those focus group sessions,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.021
no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.205
Even though at least a third of them,
deep in their hearts, actually did.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:27.022
(Laughter)

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:29.708
People don't know what they want!

00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:31.178
As Howard loves to say,

00:10:31.202 --> 00:10:33.954
"The mind knows not
what the tongue wants."

00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:35.130
It's a mystery!

00:10:35.154 --> 00:10:36.158
(Laughter)

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:38.588
And a critically important step

00:10:38.612 --> 00:10:41.943
in understanding
our own desires and tastes

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:45.599
is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want, deep down.

00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:50.278
If I asked all of you, for example,
in this room, what you want in a coffee,

00:10:50.302 --> 00:10:51.630
you know what you'd say?

00:10:51.654 --> 00:10:55.893
Every one of you would say,
"I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:58.713
It's what people always say
when you ask them.

00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:01.269
"What do you like?"
"Dark, rich, hearty roast!"

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.806
What percentage of you actually
like a dark, rich, hearty roast?

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.878
According to Howard, somewhere
between 25 and 27 percent of you.

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.762
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:11.787
(Laughter)

00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:15.143
But you will never, ever say
to someone who asks you what you want

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:17.358
that "I want a milky, weak coffee."

00:11:17.382 --> 00:11:20.281
So that's number one thing
that Howard did.

00:11:21.528 --> 00:11:24.976
Number two thing that Howard did
is he made us realize --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.976
it's another very critical point --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.174
he made us realize the importance

00:11:29.198 --> 00:11:32.197
of what he likes to call
"horizontal segmentation."

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.015
Why is this critical?

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:37.737
Because this is the way the food industry
thought before Howard.

00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:40.071
What were they obsessed with
in the early 80s?

00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:41.635
They were obsessed with mustard.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.976
In particular, they were obsessed
with the story of Grey Poupon.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.201
Used to be, there were two mustards:
French's and Gulden's.

00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:49.718
What were they? Yellow mustard.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:50.757
What's in it?

00:11:50.781 --> 00:11:52.835
Yellow mustard seeds,
turmeric, and paprika.

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:53.933
That was mustard.

00:11:53.957 --> 00:11:56.482
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.

00:11:56.506 --> 00:11:57.694
Right?

00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:03.381
Much more volatile brown mustard seed,
some white wine, a nose hit,

00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:05.343
much more delicate aromatics.

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:06.382
And what do they do?

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:11.205
They put it in a little tiny glass jar,
with a wonderful enameled label on it,

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:12.303
made it look French,

00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:14.428
even though it's made
in Oxnard, California.

00:12:14.452 --> 00:12:15.453
(Laughter)

00:12:15.477 --> 00:12:19.976
And instead of charging a dollar fifty
for the eight-ounce bottle,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.973
the way that French's and Gulden's did,

00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:23.724
they decided to charge four dollars.

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:24.960
And they had those ads.

00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:27.619
With the guy in the Rolls Royce,
eating the Grey Poupon.

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:30.429
Another pulls up, and says,
"Do you have any Grey Poupon?"

00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:33.637
And the whole thing, after they did that,
Grey Poupon takes off!

00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:35.185
Takes over the mustard business!

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:37.217
And everyone's take-home lesson from that

00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:41.976
was that the way to make people happy

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.394
is to give them something
that is more expensive,

00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:47.485
something to aspire to.

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:51.652
It's to make them turn their back
on what they think they like now,

00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:55.095
and reach out for something
higher up the mustard hierarchy.

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.120
(Laughter)

00:12:56.144 --> 00:12:58.356
A better mustard!
A more expensive mustard!

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.543
A mustard of more sophistication
and culture and meaning.

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:03.976
And Howard looked to that
and said, "That's wrong!"

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.757
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.

00:13:07.218 --> 00:13:11.319
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,
on a horizontal plane.

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.518
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.

00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:17.068
There is no perfect mustard
or imperfect mustard.

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.837
There are only different kinds of mustards
that suit different kinds of people.

00:13:21.358 --> 00:13:26.193
He fundamentally democratized
the way we think about taste.

00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:30.436
And for that, as well, we owe
Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.

00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.694
Third thing that Howard did,
and perhaps the most important,

00:13:34.718 --> 00:13:37.557
is Howard confronted the notion
of the Platonic dish.

00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:38.582
(Laughter)

00:13:38.606 --> 00:13:39.748
What do I mean by that?

00:13:39.772 --> 00:13:41.328
(Laughter)

00:13:41.352 --> 00:13:43.452
For the longest time in the food industry,

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:46.056
there was a sense that there was one way,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.808
a perfect way, to make a dish.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.285
You go to Chez Panisse,

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:56.592
they give you the red-tail sashimi
with roasted pumpkin seeds

00:13:56.616 --> 00:13:58.469
in a something something reduction.

00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:00.976
They don't give you five options
on the reduction.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.594
They don't say, "Do you want
the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"

00:14:04.618 --> 00:14:05.626
No!

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.197
You just get the reduction. Why?

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.783
Because the chef at Chez Panisse

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.395
has a Platonic notion
about red-tail sashimi.

00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:13.301
"This is the way it ought to be."

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.976
And she serves it that way
time and time again,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.262
and if you quarrel with her, she will say,

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:21.888
"You know what? You're wrong!

00:14:22.468 --> 00:14:25.188
This is the best way it ought to be
in this restaurant."

00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:28.651
Now that same idea fueled
the commercial food industry as well.

00:14:29.294 --> 00:14:32.511
They had a Platonic notion
of what tomato sauce was.

00:14:32.535 --> 00:14:34.976
And where did that come from?
It came from Italy.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.019
Italian tomato sauce is what?

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:38.975
It's blended; it's thin.

00:14:39.531 --> 00:14:41.840
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.

00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:44.841
When we talked about "authentic
tomato sauce" in the 1970s,

00:14:44.865 --> 00:14:46.674
we talked about Italian tomato sauce,

00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:48.477
we talked about the earliest Ragùs,

00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:50.653
which had no visible solids, right?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.117
Which were thin, you just put a little bit

00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:55.189
and it sunk down to the bottom
of the pasta.

00:14:55.213 --> 00:14:56.405
That's what it was.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.090
And why were we attached to that?

00:14:58.114 --> 00:15:00.852
Because we thought
that what it took to make people happy

00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:05.470
was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.

00:15:05.494 --> 00:15:10.578
And B, we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce,

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:12.030
then they would embrace it.

00:15:12.054 --> 00:15:14.788
And that's what would please
the maximum number of people.

00:15:15.288 --> 00:15:17.574
In other words,

00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:20.997
people in the cooking world
were looking for cooking universals.

00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:23.774
They were looking for one way
to treat all of us.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.378
And it's good reason for them
to be obsessed

00:15:26.402 --> 00:15:27.784
with the idea of universals,

00:15:27.808 --> 00:15:29.205
because all of science,

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:31.478
through the 19th century
and much of the 20th,

00:15:31.502 --> 00:15:33.171
was obsessed with universals.

00:15:33.195 --> 00:15:37.183
Psychologists, medical scientists,
economists

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:39.295
were all interested
in finding out the rules

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:41.509
that govern the way all of us behave.

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:43.657
But that changed, right?

00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:47.292
What is the great revolution
in science of the last 10, 15 years?

00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:50.831
It is the movement
from the search for universals

00:15:50.855 --> 00:15:52.704
to the understanding of variability.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:56.976
Now in medical science,
we don't want to know, necessarily,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.701
just how cancer works,

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:01.976
we want to know how your cancer
is different from my cancer.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.747
I guess my cancer different
from your cancer.

00:16:04.771 --> 00:16:08.859
Genetics has opened the door
to the study of human variability.

00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:10.978
What Howard Moskowitz
was doing was saying,

00:16:11.002 --> 00:16:15.113
"This same revolution needs to happen
in the world of tomato sauce."

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.572
And for that, we owe him
a great vote of thanks.

00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:23.043
I'll give you one last
illustration of variability,

00:16:23.067 --> 00:16:24.908
and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:24.932 --> 00:16:28.420
Howard not only believed that,
but he took it a second step,

00:16:28.444 --> 00:16:33.596
which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food,

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.240
we aren't just making an error;

00:16:35.264 --> 00:16:38.612
we are actually doing ourselves
a massive disservice.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.810
And the example he used was coffee.

00:16:41.223 --> 00:16:45.268
And coffee is something he did
a lot of work with, with Nescafé.

00:16:45.746 --> 00:16:49.244
If I were to ask all of you to try
and come up with a brand of coffee --

00:16:49.268 --> 00:16:52.290
a type of coffee, a brew --
that made all of you happy,

00:16:52.314 --> 00:16:54.267
and then I asked you to rate that coffee,

00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:58.348
the average score in this room for coffee
would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:02.448
If, however, you allowed me
to break you into coffee clusters,

00:17:02.472 --> 00:17:04.257
maybe three or four coffee clusters,

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:08.976
and I could make coffee just
for each of those individual clusters,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.555
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.237
The difference between coffee
at 60 and coffee at 78

00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:20.976
is a difference between coffee
that makes you wince,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.004
and coffee that makes you
deliriously happy.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.884
That is the final, and I think
most beautiful lesson,

00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:29.243
of Howard Moskowitz:

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:32.976
that in embracing the diversity
of human beings,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.365
we will find a surer way
to true happiness.

00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:36.786
Thank you.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.976
(Applause)
