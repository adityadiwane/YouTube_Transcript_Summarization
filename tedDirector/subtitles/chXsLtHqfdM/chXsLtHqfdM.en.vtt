00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.974
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:23.959
my life -- has been shaped

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:29.783
by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:33.304
From 1971 to 1977 --

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:37.184
I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:42.117
I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,

00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:46.334
in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:49.452
I worked for an Italian NGO,

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:55.602
and every single project that we set up in Africa

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:59.046
failed.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:03.190
And I was distraught.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.438
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:10.820
and we were doing good work in Africa.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.833
Instead, everything we touched we killed.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:22.936
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:25.824
"Ripples from the Zambezi,"

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:28.389
was a project where we Italians

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:34.310
decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.659
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.139
in this absolutely magnificent valley

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:45.392
going down to the Zambezi River,

00:01:45.392 --> 00:01:49.020
and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.811
and zucchini and ...

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.006
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:56.921
in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,

00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:01.056
and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:03.783
And we were amazed that the local people,

00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.870
in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.078
But instead of asking them how come they were not

00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:14.100
growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.768
"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."

00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:22.228
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:24.886
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:28.495
would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:31.316
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.788
"Look how easy agriculture is."

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:36.799
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.227
overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:44.230
and they ate everything. (Laughter)

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.814
And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:54.495
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)

00:02:54.495 --> 00:03:00.747
"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:05.835
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:08.579
but then I saw what the Americans were doing,

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.315
what the English were doing, what the French were doing,

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:13.908
and after seeing what they were doing,

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:17.267
I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:22.256
Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:26.503
You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --

00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:28.997
You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:30.797
on unsuspecting African people.

00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:32.373
You want to read the book,

00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:37.304
read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,

00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:40.311
Zambian woman economist.

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:42.681
The book was published in 2009.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:47.255
We Western donor countries have given the African continent

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:52.248
two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.

00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:56.073
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.

00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:58.261
Just go and read her book.

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:06.624
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:12.591
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:15.905
and there are only two ways we deal with people:

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:20.294
We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:23.398
The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:25.628
which means "father."

00:04:25.628 --> 00:04:29.481
But they mean two different things.

00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.842
Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture

00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:38.645
as if they were my children. "I love you so much."

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:43.152
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:45.550
as if they were my servants.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.621
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.

00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:55.204
I was given a slap in the face reading a book,

00:04:55.204 --> 00:05:00.171
"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.129
above all in economic development, if people

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.684
do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:10.511
This should be the first principle of aid.

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:14.197
The first principle of aid is respect.

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.725
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference

00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:20.526
lay a stick on the floor, and said,

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:24.784
"Can we -- can you imagine a city

00:05:24.784 --> 00:05:28.706
that is not neocolonial?"

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:32.859
I decided when I was 27 years old

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:37.066
to only respond to people,

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:41.490
and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.865
where you never initiate anything,

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:49.087
you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant

00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:52.648
of the local passion, the servant of local people

00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:57.046
who have a dream to become a better person.

00:05:57.046 --> 00:06:01.455
So what you do -- you shut up.

00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:05.167
You never arrive in a community with any ideas,

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:09.606
and you sit with the local people.

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:11.798
We don't work from offices.

00:06:11.798 --> 00:06:15.764
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.

00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:19.079
We have zero infrastructure.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.406
And what we do, we become friends,

00:06:22.406 --> 00:06:27.166
and we find out what that person wants to do.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:29.024
The most important thing is passion.

00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:31.264
You can give somebody an idea.

00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:32.886
If that person doesn't want to do it,

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:36.567
what are you going to do?

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:41.113
The passion that the person has for her own growth

00:06:41.113 --> 00:06:42.839
is the most important thing.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.396
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:49.061
is the most important thing.

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:52.148
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,

00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:57.617
because nobody in the world can succeed alone.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:00.336
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.474
but the knowledge is available.

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:06.333
So years and years ago, I had this idea:

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:10.499
Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:15.202
to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:20.027
listen to them? But not in community meetings.

00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:24.941
Let me tell you a secret.

00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:29.286
There is a problem with community meetings.

00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:32.992
Entrepreneurs never come,

00:07:32.992 --> 00:07:36.164
and they never tell you, in a public meeting,

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.780
what they want to do with their own money,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.609
what opportunity they have identified.

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:48.533
So planning has this blind spot.

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:52.824
The smartest people in your community you don't even know,

00:07:52.824 --> 00:08:00.664
because they don't come to your public meetings.

00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:04.624
What we do, we work one-on-one,

00:08:04.624 --> 00:08:06.337
and to work one-on-one, you have to create

00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:09.012
a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.

00:08:09.012 --> 00:08:11.584
You have to create a new profession.

00:08:11.584 --> 00:08:17.088
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,

00:08:17.088 --> 00:08:20.659
the family doctor of business, who sits with you

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:23.784
in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,

00:08:23.784 --> 00:08:27.822
and helps you find the resources to transform your passion

00:08:27.822 --> 00:08:30.215
into a way to make a living.

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:35.536
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:37.788
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:42.111
trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:45.923
that we arrive and tell you what to do.

00:08:45.923 --> 00:08:50.503
And so what I did in Esperance that first year

00:08:50.503 --> 00:08:55.129
was to just walk the streets, and in three days

00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:58.023
I had my first client, and I helped this first guy

00:08:58.023 --> 00:09:02.568
who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,

00:09:02.568 --> 00:09:05.873
and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,

00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:09.003
to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,

00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:11.989
"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:15.153
And I helped these five fishermen to work together

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:19.289
and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:23.122
for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way

00:09:23.122 --> 00:09:28.473
to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,

00:09:28.473 --> 00:09:29.995
and the farmers came to talk to me, said,

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:32.284
"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:35.210
In a year, I had 27 projects going on,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.362
and the government came to see me to say,

00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:39.749
"How can you do that?

00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:43.075
How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.

00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:48.728
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)

00:09:48.728 --> 00:09:56.950
So — (Applause) —

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.555
So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)

00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:04.713
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.

00:10:04.713 --> 00:10:08.248
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.

00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:09.920
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.449
who are dying of solitude.

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:18.608
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,

00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:23.160
died age 96, a few years ago.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.940
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.904
before becoming involved in business,

00:10:26.904 --> 00:10:29.781
and this is what Peter Drucker says:

00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:35.445
"Planning is actually incompatible

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:39.694
with an entrepreneurial society and economy."

00:10:39.694 --> 00:10:45.937
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.632
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:52.113
without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch

00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:56.771
want to do with their own money and their own energy.

00:10:56.771 --> 00:10:59.969
You have to learn how to get these people

00:10:59.969 --> 00:11:02.966
to come and talk to you.

00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:07.794
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,

00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:11.578
you have to be fantastic at helping them,

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:15.572
and then they will come, and they will come in droves.

00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:18.467
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:21.039
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.281
the intelligence and the passion?

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:26.812
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?

00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:32.772
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.

00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:38.043
So what I'm saying is that

00:11:38.043 --> 00:11:40.510
entrepreneurship is where it's at.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.656
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --

00:11:43.656 --> 00:11:46.969
nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --

00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:51.426
and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.

00:11:51.426 --> 00:11:54.073
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.

00:11:54.073 --> 00:11:57.394
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.

00:11:57.394 --> 00:12:00.482
What we have to look at is at how we

00:12:00.482 --> 00:12:06.500
feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.051
for seven billion people in a sustainable way.

00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:13.945
The technologies do not exist to do that.

00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:17.313
Who is going to invent the technology

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:23.811
for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!

00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:26.704
Government? Forget about it!

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:31.958
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.

00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.853
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine

00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:36.526
many, many years ago.

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.746
There was a group of experts who were invited

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:43.374
to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.

00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:45.864
And in 1860, this group of people came together,

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.811
and they all speculated about what would happen

00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:50.665
to the city of New York in 100 years,

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.141
and the conclusion was unanimous:

00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:56.082
The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.

00:12:56.082 --> 00:12:58.343
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,

00:12:58.343 --> 00:13:01.309
if the population keeps growing at this rate,

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:05.445
to move the population of New York around,

00:13:05.445 --> 00:13:08.310
they would have needed six million horses,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.665
and the manure created by six million horses

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:14.044
would be impossible to deal with.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:19.674
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:24.723
So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology

00:13:24.723 --> 00:13:29.541
that is going to choke the life out of New York.

00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:34.670
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.273
in the United States of America, there were 1,001

00:13:39.273 --> 00:13:45.653
car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.

00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:49.259
The idea of finding a different technology

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:51.621
had absolutely taken over,

00:13:51.621 --> 00:13:56.537
and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.

00:13:56.537 --> 00:14:02.169
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.

00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:06.540
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.934
First, you have to offer them confidentiality.

00:14:09.934 --> 00:14:12.272
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.

00:14:12.272 --> 00:14:16.582
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,

00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:20.034
passionate service to them.

00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:23.681
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.

00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:26.452
The smallest company, the biggest company,

00:14:26.452 --> 00:14:29.842
has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:

00:14:29.842 --> 00:14:34.093
The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,

00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:37.917
you have to have fantastic marketing,

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:41.286
and you have to have tremendous financial management.

00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:43.874
Guess what?

00:14:43.874 --> 00:14:46.288
We have never met a single human being

00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:51.935
in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.

00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:54.766
It doesn't exist.

00:14:54.766 --> 00:14:57.516
This person has never been born.

00:14:57.516 --> 00:15:00.008
We've done the research, and we have looked

00:15:00.008 --> 00:15:03.959
at the 100 iconic companies of the world --

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:08.540
Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.143
all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.819
There's only one thing that all the successful companies

00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:17.307
in the world have in common, only one:

00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:21.842
None were started by one person.

00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:26.344
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds

00:15:26.344 --> 00:15:29.885
in Northumberland, and we start the class

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:34.309
by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:38.146
and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.774
in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.929
how many times Richard uses the word "I"

00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:47.638
and how many times he uses the word "we."

00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:52.378
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:55.631
He wasn't alone when he started.

00:15:55.631 --> 00:16:00.675
Nobody started a company alone. No one.

00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:03.781
So we can create the community

00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:07.207
where we have facilitators who come from a small business background

00:16:07.207 --> 00:16:14.704
sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies

00:16:14.704 --> 00:16:18.376
who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:21.617
who talks about this epic,

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:23.872
somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?

00:16:23.872 --> 00:16:25.811
What can you do? Can you make it?

00:16:25.811 --> 00:16:28.061
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"

00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:31.815
"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"

00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:33.903
We activate communities.

00:16:33.903 --> 00:16:37.947
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator

00:16:37.947 --> 00:16:41.070
to help you to find resources and people

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.059
and we have discovered that the miracle

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:46.563
of the intelligence of local people is such

00:16:46.563 --> 00:16:50.270
that you can change the culture and the economy

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.451
of this community just by capturing the passion,

00:16:54.451 --> 00:16:58.088
the energy and imagination of your own people.

00:16:58.088 --> 00:17:02.781
Thank you. (Applause)
