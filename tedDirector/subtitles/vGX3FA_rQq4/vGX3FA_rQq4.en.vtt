00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.731
Back home, my friends call me nicknames,

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:17.988
such as "The Giant Clam Girl,"

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:19.295
"Clam Queen,"

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.555
or, "The Mother of Clams."

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.930
(Laughter)

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:25.209
This is because every time I see them,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.494
I talk nonstop about giant clams all day,

00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:29.795
every day.

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:34.596
Giant clams are these massive
and colorful shelled marine animals,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.268
the largest of its kind.

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:38.493
Just look at this shell.

00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:43.313
The biggest recorded individual
was four-and-a-half-feet long

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.711
and weighed about 550 pounds.

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:48.992
That is almost as heavy
as three baby elephants.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.683
South Pacific legends once described
giant clams as man-eaters

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:58.708
that would lie in wait on the seabed
to trap unsuspecting divers.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.389
A story goes that a diver
had lost his legs

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:05.328
while trying to retrieve a pearl
from a giant clam.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:07.310
I thought, "Really?"

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:09.922
So out of curiosity,

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.593
I did an experiment using myself as bait.

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:14.368
(Laughter)

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.669
I carefully placed my hand
into the clam's mouth and waited.

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:20.331
Hmm ...

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:21.755
I still have my hand.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.451
It seems that these gentle giants
would rather retreat

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.056
and protect their fleshy bodies

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.291
than feed on me.

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:30.697
So much for those killer clam myths!

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.470
Unfortunately, the reality is,

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.121
we are the giant clams' biggest threat.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:42.041
Considered a delicacy throughout
the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.876
giant clams have been traditionally
fished as seafood.

00:01:45.614 --> 00:01:49.154
Fishermen are particularly interested
in their adductor muscles,

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:52.707
which are organs that hold
the two shells together like a hinge.

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:54.948
Just for their muscles,

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:57.311
giant clams were almost
hunted to extinction

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:00.000
between the 1960s and 1980s.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.557
Clamshells are also popular
in the ornamental trade

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.547
as jewelry and for display.

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:08.857
In the South China Sea,

00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:12.783
fishermen went out of their way
to collect fossilized clamshells

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:15.412
by digging through large areas
of coral reefs.

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:21.166
These were later carved and sold
as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.

00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:25.421
Giant clams, dead or alive,
are not safe from us.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.797
It's a "clamity!"

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:31.637
(Laughter)

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.553
(Applause)

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:41.219
With the spotlight on more
charismatic marine animals

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:43.409
such as the whales and coral reefs,

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:47.133
it is easy to forget that other
marine life needs our help, too.

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:52.471
My fascination with giant clams
got me started on conservation research

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:55.738
to fill in the knowledge gaps
on their ecology and behavior.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.684
One of the discoveries that we made
was that giant clams could walk

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.113
across the seafloor.

00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:03.694
Yes, you heard me right:

00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:04.919
they can walk.

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:06.548
To find out,

00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:08.805
we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.727
Now watch what happens over 24 hours.

00:03:16.892 --> 00:03:20.654
We think that walking is important
for getting away from predators

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:22.666
and finding mates for breeding.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.743
While it can hard to imagine
any movement in these enormous animals,

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:30.251
giant clams up to 400 pounds
can still walk,

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:31.983
they just move slower.

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:37.735
During my PhD, I discovered
more secrets about the giant clams.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.984
But there was something
missing in my work.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:43.772
I found myself asking,

00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:47.255
"Why should people care
about conserving giant clams?" --

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.128
other than myself, of course.

00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:54.614
(Laughter)

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:59.875
It turns out that giant clams
have a giant impact on coral reefs.

00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:03.673
These multitasking clams
are reef builders,

00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:05.472
food factories,

00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:07.843
shelters for shrimps and crabs

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.069
and water filters,

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:10.444
all rolled into one.

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:12.363
In a nutshell,

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:14.756
giant clams play a major contributing role

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.107
as residents of their own reef home,

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:20.234
and just having them around
keeps the reef healthy.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.111
And because they can live
up to 100 years old,

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.505
giant clams make vital indicators
of coral reef health.

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:31.133
So when giant clams
start to disappear from coral reefs,

00:04:31.777 --> 00:04:33.774
their absence can serve as an alarm bell

00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:36.082
for scientists to start paying attention,

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:38.357
similar to the canary in a coal mine.

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.901
But giant clams are endangered.

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:45.161
The largest clam in the world
is facing the threat of extinction,

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:49.715
with more than 50 percent
of the wild population severely depleted.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:54.227
And the ecological benefits
of having giant clams on coral reefs

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:58.762
are likely to continue
only if populations are healthy,

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:01.123
making their conservation paramount.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.417
So I stand here today to give a voice
to the giant clams,

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.448
because I care a whole lot
for these amazing animals,

00:05:08.472 --> 00:05:10.590
and they deserve to be cared for.

00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:14.979
It is time for the giant clams
to step out of their shells,

00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:19.150
and show the world that they, too,
can be the heroes of the oceans.

00:05:19.174 --> 00:05:20.389
Thank you very much.

00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:24.566
(Applause)
