00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.793
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:17.033
and this little white dog called Maui

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.918
was staying with me.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.390
Half the city was dark because of a power cut,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.614
and I was living on the dark side.

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.723
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:27.827
so I had to carry him up the stairs,

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.915
actually down the stairs first, for his walk,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:32.803
and then bring him back up.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.784
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:37.883
up to the seventh floor every day.

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:39.456
And through all of this,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.760
I had to hold a torch between my teeth.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.404
The stores nearby were out of flashlights

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:47.341
and batteries and bread.

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.004
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.978
to a branch of my gym.

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:55.057
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:58.358
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.650
at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.499
to juice my multiple devices.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.224
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:09.849
and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.418
I wasn't the only one.

00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:15.182
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue

00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:17.646
under their umbrellas charging their cell phones

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:19.683
from outlets on the street.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.940
Nature had just reminded us

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.256
that it was stronger than all our technology,

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:27.525
and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.401
I think there's nothing like a crisis

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.590
to tell you what's really important and what's not,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.152
and Sandy made me realize that our devices

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:38.418
and their connectivity matter to us

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:42.936
right up there with food and shelter.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.253
The self as we once knew it no longer exists,

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:48.745
and I think that an abstract, digital universe

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:51.270
has become a part of our identity,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.522
and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:58.365
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self

00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:00.834
because the self and fiction have a lot in common.

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:04.151
They're both stories, interpretations.

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.604
You and I can experience things without a story.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.686
We might run up the stairs too quickly

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:10.373
and we might get breathless.

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:12.903
But the larger sense that we have of our lives,

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:16.263
the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:19.383
Our story of our life is based on direct experience,

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:21.277
but it's embellished.

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:24.125
A novel needs scene after scene to build,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.273
and the story of our life needs an arc as well.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:29.964
It needs months and years.

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:32.982
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.

00:02:32.982 --> 00:02:35.572
But the story is not about these chapters.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.517
It's the whole book.

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:40.860
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.039
the victories and the disappointments,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.244
but it's because how because of these,

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:48.397
and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,

00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:50.492
we find our place in the world

00:02:50.492 --> 00:02:53.572
and we change it and we change ourselves.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.965
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.980
a long arc of time that is our lifespan,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.483
and the timeframe of direct experience

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:03.936
that is the moment.

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:06.066
Now the self that experiences directly

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.967
can only exist in the moment,

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.729
but the one that narrates needs several moments,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.843
a whole sequence of them,

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:15.088
and that's why our full sense of self

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:18.020
needs both immersive experience

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.465
and the flow of time.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:23.614
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,

00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:26.182
in the erosion of a grain of sand,

00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:29.974
in the budding of a little bud into a rose.

00:03:29.974 --> 00:03:32.509
Without it, we would have no music.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.547
Our own emotions and state of mind

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.660
often encode time,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.218
regret or nostalgia about the past,

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.718
hope or dread about the future.

00:03:42.718 --> 00:03:46.663
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.186
The overall time that we have for our narrative,

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:51.360
our lifespan, has been increasing,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.477
but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:56.813
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us

00:03:56.813 --> 00:04:00.073
in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.343
and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.216
of the material world,

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:06.652
and this granular understanding

00:04:06.652 --> 00:04:08.955
has generated reams of data

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:11.316
that our brains can no longer comprehend

00:04:11.316 --> 00:04:14.751
and for which we need more and more complicated computers.

00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:17.025
All of this to say that the gap

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:19.606
between what we can perceive and what we can measure

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:21.528
is only going to widen.

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.564
Science can do things with and in a picosecond,

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:27.267
but you and I are never going to have the inner experience

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.453
of a millionth of a millionth of a second.

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.495
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:37.434
to the sun, the moon and the seasons,

00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:40.174
and this is why we need that long arc of time

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.403
with the past, the present and the future

00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:44.167
to see things for what they are,

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.010
to separate signal from noise

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.566
and the self from sensations.

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:52.175
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:53.930
not just in the material world,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.220
but in our own intentions and our motivations.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.210
What happens when that arrow goes awry?

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.694
What happens when time warps?

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:06.643
So many of us today have the sensation

00:05:06.643 --> 00:05:08.887
that time's arrow is pointing everywhere

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:11.152
and nowhere at once.

00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:13.839
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.828
in the same way that it does in the natural one.

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:20.528
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.758
as well as time.

00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:24.071
Far away over there is now here.

00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.800
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.679
whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.114
And that's not all.

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:33.583
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.859
your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:38.994
because the Internet also archives,

00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:40.788
and it warps the past.

00:05:40.788 --> 00:05:42.938
With no distinction left between the past,

00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:46.210
the present and the future, and the here or there,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.026
we are left with this moment everywhere,

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:52.450
this moment that I'll call the digital now.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.618
Just how can we prioritize

00:05:54.618 --> 00:05:56.977
in the landscape of the digital now?

00:05:56.977 --> 00:05:58.882
This digital now is not the present,

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:00.935
because it's always a few seconds ahead,

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:02.768
with Twitter streams that are already trending

00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:04.745
and news from other time zones.

00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:07.455
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot

00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:09.943
or the second that you bite into a pastry

00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:13.280
or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.132
This now bears very little physical

00:06:15.132 --> 00:06:18.073
or psychological reference to our own state.

00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:20.333
Its focus, instead, is to distract us

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.283
at every turn on the road.

00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:24.454
Every digital landmark is an invitation

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:26.869
to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.488
and do something else.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.481
Are you reading an interview by an author?

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:33.121
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.

00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:35.850
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.718
Find other people reading those books.

00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:40.762
Travel can be liberating,

00:06:40.762 --> 00:06:42.523
but when it is incessant, we become

00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:44.750
permanent exiles without repose.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.494
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly

00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:49.541
for its own sake.

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.129
Not just is the digital now far from the present,

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.791
but it's in direct competition with it,

00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.173
and this is because not just am I absent from it,

00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:58.266
but so are you.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:01.057
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:04.747
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.

00:07:04.747 --> 00:07:07.575
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,

00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:09.374
shop for Parisian macarons,

00:07:09.374 --> 00:07:11.831
and leave video messages that get picked up later.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.806
At all times, I can operate

00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:16.042
at a different rhythm and pace from you,

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:17.959
while I sustain the illusion

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:21.487
that I'm tapped into you in real time.

00:07:21.487 --> 00:07:23.096
Sandy was a reminder

00:07:23.096 --> 00:07:25.201
of how such an illusion can shatter.

00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:27.065
There were those with power and water,

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:28.561
and those without.

00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:30.894
There are those who went back to their lives,

00:07:30.894 --> 00:07:32.931
and those who are still displaced

00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:35.286
after so many months.

00:07:35.286 --> 00:07:37.988
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate

00:07:37.988 --> 00:07:41.434
the illusion for those who have it that everyone does,

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:44.062
and then, like an ironic slap in the face,

00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:46.180
it makes it true.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.857
For example, it's said that there are more people

00:07:47.857 --> 00:07:50.991
in India with access to cell phones than toilets.

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.413
Now if this rift, which is already so great

00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:54.875
in many parts of the world,

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.230
between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.812
isn't somehow bridged,

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.863
there will be ruptures between the digital

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:04.038
and the real.

00:08:04.038 --> 00:08:07.676
For us as individuals who live in the digital now

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:10.155
and spend most of our waking moments in it,

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.332
the challenge is to live in two streams of time

00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:15.276
that are parallel and almost simultaneous.

00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:19.376
How does one live inside distraction?

00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:21.326
We might think that those younger than us,

00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:24.940
those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.078
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.

00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:29.782
I remember my grandfather revising

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:32.044
the capitals of the world with me.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.794
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,

00:08:34.794 --> 00:08:37.569
and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:40.468
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information

00:08:40.468 --> 00:08:42.633
with apps and hyperlinks,

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:44.544
but it really wouldn't be the same,

00:08:44.544 --> 00:08:46.824
because much later, I went to Vienna,

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:48.792
and I went to the Spanish riding school,

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:52.157
and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.727
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:57.505
on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter

00:08:57.505 --> 00:09:00.733
and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:03.428
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,

00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:06.184
I get back that feeling of being a child,

00:09:06.184 --> 00:09:08.562
hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself

00:09:08.562 --> 00:09:10.782
on his shoulder,

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:13.982
and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.

00:09:13.982 --> 00:09:16.449
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:19.691
so often in information and knowledge and fact,

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:21.715
but it was about so much more

00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:25.505
than information or knowledge or fact.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:27.629
Time-warping technology challenges

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:29.581
our deepest core,

00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.348
because we are able to archive the past

00:09:33.348 --> 00:09:36.589
and some of it becomes hard to forget,

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:39.193
even as the current moment

00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:41.812
is increasingly unmemorable.

00:09:41.812 --> 00:09:44.552
We want to clutch, and we are left instead

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:47.015
clutching at a series of static moments.

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.721
They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.

00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:52.514
By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,

00:09:52.514 --> 00:09:54.479
but time is not data.

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:56.612
It cannot be stored.

00:09:56.612 --> 00:09:58.628
You and I know exactly what it means like

00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:00.532
to be truly present in a moment.

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:01.749
It might have happened while we were

00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:03.508
playing an instrument,

00:10:03.508 --> 00:10:05.356
or looking into the eyes of someone we've known

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:07.540
for a very long time.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.571
At such moments, our selves are complete.

00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:12.639
The self that lives in the long narrative arc

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.722
and the self that experiences the moment

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:16.114
become one.

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:18.056
The present encapsulates the past

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:20.487
and a promise for the future.

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.455
The present joins a flow of time

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.698
from before and after.

00:10:24.698 --> 00:10:28.255
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:30.594
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:31.946
and she tucked up her sari

00:10:31.946 --> 00:10:33.674
and she jumped over it.

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.328
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,

00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:40.436
cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.

00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:42.843
My grandmother taught me that things happen

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:46.564
in the time they take, that time can't be fought,

00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:48.397
and because it will pass and it will move,

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:51.511
we owe the present moment our full attention.

00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.155
Attention is time.

00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:56.338
One of my yoga instructors once said

00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:58.581
that love is attention,

00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:00.415
and definitely from my grandmother,

00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:04.741
love and attention were one and the same thing.

00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.324
The digital world cannibalizes time,

00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:10.704
and in doing so, I want to suggest

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.378
that what it threatens

00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:14.808
is the completeness of ourselves.

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:17.166
It threatens the flow of love.

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:19.187
But we don't need to let it.

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:20.655
We can choose otherwise.

00:11:20.655 --> 00:11:22.732
We've seen again and again

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.962
just how creative technology can be,

00:11:24.962 --> 00:11:27.202
and in our lives and in our actions,

00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:31.191
we can choose those solutions and those innovations

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.299
and those moments that restore the flow of time

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:37.920
instead of fragmenting it.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.500
We can slow down and we can tune in

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.172
to the ebb and flow of time.

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:47.120
We can choose to take time back.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.320
Thank you.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.320
(Applause)
