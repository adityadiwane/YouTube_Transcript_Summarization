00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So, 120 years ago,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Dr. RÃ¶ntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
That image was the start of the X-ray technology.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The first shot I ever did

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And I do really like this shot, because

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in the sole of the sneakers.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
get it right first time.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Moving on to something a bit larger,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
this is an X-ray of a bus.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And the bus is full of people.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And back in the '60s,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
they used to teach student radiographers

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
but on dead people.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So, I've still got access to one of these dead people

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
because she's very old and fragile.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
But everyone on that bus is Frieda.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
which is the sort of machine you have on borders,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Fairly obvious what that is.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So, using large-scale objects

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
does sort of create drama

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Technology is moving ahead,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and these large cargo scanner X-rays

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Again though, to make it come alive

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
you need, somehow, to add the human element.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And I think the reason this image works, again, is because

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Frieda is driving the bulldozer.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.260
(Laughter)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Quite a difficult brief,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
don't show the surface, I show what's within.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So, the fashionistas don't really like me

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
it looks the same.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
(Laughter)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We all look the same inside, believe me.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I peel back the layers and expose it.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
The design comes from within.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
It's not just Topshop,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And what's really interesting is,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And should that pig have grown,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.260
(Laughter)

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
But once the bones had fused together

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
it would have been healthy.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
So, that's an empty parka jacket.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But I quite love the way it's posed.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Nature is my greatest inspiration.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
is how nature is related to architecture.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
If you look at the roof of the Eden Project,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And I'm sure those architects are inspired,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
that floats on the top of a pond.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And the door to my X-ray room

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is made of lead and steel.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
(Laughter)

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
What's interesting really about X-ray really

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
is, if you think about it, is that that technology

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
or looking for contraband or whatever.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And I use that sort of technology

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
to create things that are quite beautiful.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So, still working with film, I'm afraid.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
apart from these large cargo-scanning machines,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
which is show my pictures big.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They scan each individual X-ray.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Still has the tag in it from me buying it,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
But there are four X-ray plates.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
You can see them overlapping.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So, when you move forward from something fairly small,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
a dress which is this size,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
you can see that that is a lot of work.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
There is over 500 separate components.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And I sent them back an X-ray.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
(Laughter) I kid you not.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
The one on the left is an x-ray.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
But this time I had to use a real body.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to make it look like it was a real athlete.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
But people do donate their bodies to art and science.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And when they do, I'm in the queue.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So, I like to use them.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.260
(Laughter)

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It makes it more organic, more natural.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It's whatever takes my fancy, really.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
But I just like it in bright orange.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
it sort of adds another level.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
The most difficult things to X-ray,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
the most technically challenging things to X-ray

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
are the lightest things, the most delicate things.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
To get the detail in a feather,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
that's quite a challenge.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Video: (Music)

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
The thing in there is very dangerous.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
If you touch that, you could possibly die

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
through radiation poisoning.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
It's cumulative.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
(Music)

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.260
It has human connotations.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
but also it looks like it's a robot,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and it comes from a sci-fi genus.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
It's a surprise that it has humanity,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:36.260
but also man-made, future, alien associations.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And it's just a bit spooky.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
(Music)

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
which is used on the borders

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
of X-rays through the lorry.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
So, these little details

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
help to make it work, make it real.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
(Music)

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
The problem with using living people is that

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
So, to avoid that --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
I have to avoid it somehow --

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
is I use dead people.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.260
to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
to train in taking X-rays of the human body,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
at different densities.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
(Music)

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
(Music)

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Look at this monster.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
(Music)

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
It's so basic. It just grows wild.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
That's what I really like about it,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
It's just happening.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
Not that that is particularly beautiful

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
when you look at it with the human eye,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and the more time it needs.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
The lighter the object, the less radiation.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
The longer the exposure goes on for,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
the more detail you get.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
(Music)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
If you look at this, just the tube,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
it is quite bright.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.260
So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
What I like is how hard the edges are,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
how sharp.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
(Music)

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
I travel beyond the surface and show

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
something for what it's worth,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
for what it's really made of, how it really works.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
But also I find that

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
which is things that people are used to seeing.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And that's the sort of thing I've been doing.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I've got the opportunity now to show you

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
what I'm going to be doing in the future.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
This is a commercial application of my most recent work.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
So, what am I doing in the future?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
So, I've taken it apart, component by component,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
months and months and months of work.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
And with this image, I'm going to be displaying

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
it in the Victoria and Albert Museum

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
not an easy task, in itself.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
and up against you is a wall.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And I'm going to take that idea

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I'm also looking to

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
take my work from the two-dimensional form

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
to a more three-dimensional form.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
And this is quite a good way of doing it.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
I'm also working now with X-ray video.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and they're actually moving and growing

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
(Applause)
