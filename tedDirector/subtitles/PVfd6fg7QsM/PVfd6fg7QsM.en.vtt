00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
In high school, I took a bus to school

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
an hour each way every day.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And I was always absorbed in a book,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
science fiction book,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
which took my mind to other worlds,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and satisfied, in a narrative form,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.260
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I was out in the woods,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
hiking and taking "samples" --

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
You know, I was a real science geek.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
But it was all about trying to understand the world,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
understand the limits of possibility.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And my love of science fiction

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
we were going to the moon,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
we were exploring the deep oceans.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
with his amazing specials that showed us

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
animals and places and a wondrous world

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that we could never really have previously imagined.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So, that seemed to resonate

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
with the whole science fiction part of it.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And I was an artist.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I could draw. I could paint.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And I found that because there weren't video games

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and this saturation of CG movies and all of this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
imagery in the media landscape,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
I had to create these images in my head.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
You know, we all did, as kids having to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
read a book, and through the author's description,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
put something on the movie screen in our heads.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
alien creatures, alien worlds,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
robots, spaceships, all that stuff.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I was endlessly getting busted in math class

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
doodling behind the textbook.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
That was -- the creativity

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
had to find its outlet somehow.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
actually got me very excited about the fact that there was

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
an alien world right here on Earth.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I might not really go to an alien world

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
on a spaceship someday --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that seemed pretty darn unlikely.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
But that was a world I could really go to,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
as anything that I had imagined

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
from reading these books.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
at the age of 15.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And the only problem with that was that I lived

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
in a little village in Canada,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
600 miles from the nearest ocean.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
But I didn't let that daunt me.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I pestered my father until he finally found

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
right across the border from where we live.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And I actually got certified

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
in Buffalo, New York.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
for another two years,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
until we moved to California.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Since then, in the intervening

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
40 years,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and even the shallow oceans,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
are so rich with amazing life

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that really is beyond our imagination.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Nature's imagination is so boundless

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
compared to our own

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
meager human imagination.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
of what I see when I make these dives.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and just as strong as it ever was.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
But when I chose a career as an adult,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
it was filmmaking.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
this urge I had to tell stories

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
with my urges to create images.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
together, and that made sense.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And of course the stories that I chose to tell

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and "The Abyss."

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
of underwater and diving with filmmaking.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So, you know, merging the two passions.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
which was that to solve a specific narrative

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
problem on that film,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.260
which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.260
we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And this resulted in the first soft-surface

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
character, CG animation

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that was ever in a movie.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And even though the film didn't make any money --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
barely broke even, I should say --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the global audience, was mesmerized

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
by this apparent magic.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
They were seeing something magical.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And so that got me very excited.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
into the cinematic art."

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
we took that much farther.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
in that film. The success hung in the balance

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
on whether that effect would work.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And it did, and we created magic again,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and we had the same result with an audience --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
although we did make a little more money on that one.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So, drawing a line through those two dots

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
of experience

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
this was a whole new world of creativity

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
for film artists.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
So, I started a company with Stan Winston,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
my good friend Stan Winston,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
who is the premier make-up and creature designer

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And the concept of the company was

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
that we would leapfrog past

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
the analog processes of optical printers and so on,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and we would go right to digital production.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
in the creature and character design stuff

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
that we had actually founded the company to do.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.260
which was meant to absolutely push the envelope

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
of visual effects,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
of CG effects, beyond,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
with realistic human emotive characters

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
generated in CG,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
and the main characters would all be in CG,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and the world would be in CG.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And the envelope pushed back,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and I was told by the folks at my company

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
(Laughter)

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
"It's going to be this epic romance,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
passionate film."

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Secretly, what I wanted to do was

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And that's why I made the movie.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
(Applause)

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
But I convinced them. I said,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And I talked them into funding an expedition.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
(Laughter)

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
about your imagination creating a reality.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
I find myself in a Russian submersible

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
looking at the real Titanic through a view port.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
(Applause)

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Now, that blew my mind.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and lights and all kinds of things.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
But, it struck me how much

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
this dive, these deep dives,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
was like a space mission.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
You know, where it was highly technical,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and it required enormous planning.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
hostile environment

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
where there is no hope of rescue

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
if you can't get back by yourself.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
living in a science fiction movie.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
This is really cool."

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
it was everything. It was adventure,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
it was curiosity, it was imagination.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And it was an experience that

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Hollywood couldn't give me.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
out that window.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and sometimes things that I had never seen before,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
sometimes things that no one had seen before,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
that actually were not described by science

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
at the time that we saw them and imaged them.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So, I was completely smitten by this,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and had to do more.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
After the success of "Titanic,"

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
as a Hollywood movie maker,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And so, we started planning these

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
expeditions.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And we wound up going to the Bismark,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and exploring it with robotic vehicles.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
We went back to the Titanic wreck.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
We took little bots that we had created

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
that spooled a fiber optic.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And the idea was to go in and do an interior

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.260
survey of that ship, which had never been done.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
so we created technology to do it.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
and looking out at planks that look much like this,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
where I knew that the band had played.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
through the corridor of the ship.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
When I say, "I'm operating it,"

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
but my mind is in the vehicle.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
I felt like I was physically present

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
inside the shipwreck of Titanic.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And it was the most surreal kind

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
of deja vu experience I've ever had,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.260
because I would know before I turned a corner

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
what was going to be there before the lights

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
of the vehicle actually revealed it,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
because I had walked the set for months

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
when we were making the movie.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And the set was based as an exact replica

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
on the blueprints of the ship.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And it really made me realize that

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
the telepresence experience --

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that you actually can have these robotic avatars,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260
then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
into this other form of existence.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
It was really, really quite profound.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
some decades out

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
as we start to have cyborg bodies

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
for exploration or for other means

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
in many sort of

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
post-human futures

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
that I can imagine,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
as a science fiction fan.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.260
So, having done these expeditions,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
such as at the deep ocean vents

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
where we had these amazing, amazing animals --

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
They don't survive on sunlight-based

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
system the way we do.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
a 500-degree-Centigrade

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
water plumes.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
You think they can't possibly exist.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
At the same time

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
I was getting very interested in space science as well --

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And I wound up getting involved with

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
the space community,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
really involved with NASA,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
sitting on the NASA advisory board,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
planning actual space missions,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
biomedical protocols,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and all these sorts of things,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
to actually go and fly to the international space station

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
with our 3D camera systems.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And this was fascinating.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
with us into the deep.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And taking them down so that they had access --

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
astrobiologists, planetary scientists,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
people who were interested in these extreme environments --

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and take samples and test instruments, and so on.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So, here we were making documentary films,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
but actually doing science,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
and actually doing space science.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
I'd completely closed the loop

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
between being the science fiction fan,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
you know, as a kid,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and doing this stuff for real.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And you know, along the way in this journey

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
of discovery,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I learned a lot.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
about leadership.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Now you think director has got to be a leader,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
I didn't really learn about leadership

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
until I did these expeditions.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Because I had to, at a certain point, say,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
"What am I doing out here?

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
We don't make money at these damn shows.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
People sort of think I went away

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
someplace, sitting at the beach.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Made all these films, made all these documentary films

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
for a very limited audience.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
You're doing it for the task itself,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
for the challenge --

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
for the thrill of discovery,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and for that strange bond that happens

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
working for years at a time,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And in that bond, you realize

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
that the most important thing

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
is the respect that you have for them

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and that they have for you, that you've done a task

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
that you can't explain to someone else.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
When you come back to the shore and you say,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and the this and the that,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
all the technology of it, and the difficulty,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.260
maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and they know they can never explain it.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
So, when I came back to make my next movie,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
which was "Avatar,"

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
which is that you respect your team,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and you earn their respect in return.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
And it really changed the dynamic.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So, here I was again with a small team,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
in uncharted territory,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
that didn't exist before.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Tremendously exciting.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Tremendously challenging.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
And it completely changed how I do movies.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
you brought back the ocean organisms

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and put them on the planet of Pandora."

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.260
the process itself, that changed as a result of that.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
So, what can we synthesize out of all this?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
You know, what are the lessons learned?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
Well, I think number one is

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
curiosity.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
It's the most powerful thing you own.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Imagination is a force

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.260
that can actually manifest a reality.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And the respect of your team

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
is more important than all the

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
laurels in the world.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
I have young filmmakers

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.260
come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
don't bet against yourself,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and take risks."

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
NASA has this phrase that they like:

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
"Failure is not an option."

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
But failure has to be an option

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
And no important endeavor

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that required innovation

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
was done without risk.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
You have to be willing to take those risks.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
So, that's the thought I would leave you with,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
is that in whatever you're doing,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
failure is an option,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
but fear is not. Thank you.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:17:01.260
(Applause)
