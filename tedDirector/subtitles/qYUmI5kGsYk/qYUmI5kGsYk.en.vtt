00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:18.336
We humans are becoming an urban species,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.136
so cities, they are our natural habitat.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.360
That is where we live.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.976
In 2014, over 54 percent

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.616
of the world population

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.680
was living in cities,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.256
and I can bet you

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.936
that so many of these people have thought

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.536
of how they would do things differently,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.216
like if I only had the tools

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.616
to change things in my city,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.896
what would I do?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520
What would my dream city be like?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.896
And these tools,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.280
this is just what we gave them.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.656
Two years ago, my team and I,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.096
we released a game,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.816
"Cities: Skylines."

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.680
It is a game about building cities.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.336
So I have always been
interested in cities as systems.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.256
It's something that I find
immensely interesting.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.416
But what I didn't understand

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.920
was that I am not alone in this.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.336
People love cities.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.240
They are interested. They have ideas.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.096
The game was an instant hit.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.720
So far, over three and a half
million people have played it.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.056
And it's not just about playing.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.816
We also have really awesome
sharing systems.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.536
So people play, they create cities

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.376
and then they are sharing these creations,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440
showing off what they have made.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.536
And what I will show you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.776
is some of these cities

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.120
created by the players.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.216
So the game is about self-expression,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.496
creativity,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.136
not just overcoming the challenges
posed by the simulation.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.760
It is about showing
what your cities look like.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.576
So I have a couple of videos.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.416
These are from YouTube.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.895
And these are some of the most
interesting city designs I have seen.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.416
So they are all different,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.760
and I hope you like all of these.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.376
This one is called The Netherlands.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.600
It's by Silvarret.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.496
And when you start the game,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.600
you have an empty piece of land.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.056
This land, it can be based
on the real world,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.016
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.016
or you can, of course, download
a city made by someone else

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.576
and play in that.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.016
But what Silvarret has done here

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.616
is that what he wanted to make

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.376
was not a real city.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.056
This is a fantasy city,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.776
even though it looks real.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.640
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city
that could be in the Netherlands.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.656
So he kind of investigated

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.696
what are the characteristics
of cities in the Netherlands

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.296
and combined a couple of those,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.016
and this is what he created.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.696
So it is a city,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.976
but it is not a real city,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.256
but it could be.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.960
It looks just like the Netherlands.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.936
So the places are really
densely populated.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.936
So what you need is highways, trains,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.216
anything connecting
these small town centers together.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.456
Lots of people, lots of moving,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.600
so transportation is the key here.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.216
But then let's go even more
on the fantasy side.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.880
Let's go into the future.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.616
This is one of my personal favorites.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.360
These city designs
are what I love the most.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.296
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.480
and the basic idea is
that you have concentric circle routes.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.536
So the city is a big circle

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.400
with tinier circles inside.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.656
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.096
and then people actually live
on the outer ring,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.896
because there is less traffic,
less noise, less pollution,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.856
so that is where you want to live.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.816
But the services
are still really close by.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.495
They are in the center.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.680
And this is the soul of the game.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.376
The player has to understand

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.976
what are the wishes, what are the needs

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of the tiny people living in the cities.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.496
So you need to know
where you should put the things.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.056
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.816
It needs to be accessible.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.720
Citizens need to reach the hospital.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.176
And this is one way to do it.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.040
So maybe this is something
that we might be seeing someday.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.080
And then even more into the future.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.240
Astergea by Yuttho.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.616
So Yuttho does YouTube videos
and plays the game.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.296
What he did here
was actually a 12-point series

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.480
of creating this city.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.536
So what he does is he plays the game,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.816
he records it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.480
and he explains as he's going
what he's doing and why.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.296
And as a part of this series,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.576
he actually did an interview
with an actual urban planner

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.400
called Jeff Speck.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.256
And Speck is an expert
on the concept of walkability.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.656
The basic idea is that
if you want your citizens to walk,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.616
which is kind of beneficial,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.376
you actually need to have walking
as a reasonable means of transportation.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.200
It should be a good way to reach places.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.376
So what Yuttho did
was that he explained this concept,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.416
he had Speck explain it, too,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.400
and then he applied it
to the city that he was building.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.096
So what we are seeing
is Yuttho's vision of the future:

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.376
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.000
connecting high-rise buildings.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.376
Maybe this is what
the future might look like.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.856
And the game system
works really well for this.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.696
We are seeing some
real-world uses to this game.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.416
So we know that some urban planners
are using it as a sketching tool,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.736
so while the simulation
is not completely realistic,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.696
it is realistic enough
that if something works in the game,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.616
it is highly likely that it
will also work in the real world,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.736
so that you can actually try out things,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.736
see if this intersection
might fit this kind of a situation.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.296
If we build a new road, would it help?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.280
And this is what you can do
with this game.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.176
There was one really
interesting contest held

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.880
by the Finnish city of HÃ¤meenlinna.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.656
So what they did
was that they had a new area

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.080
that they wanted to develop in the city.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.496
They made a map with the existing city,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.696
they left empty the area
that they would want to develop

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.056
and shared this map.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.096
So anyone could download the map,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.736
play the game, build the area

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.480
and submit their creations
to the city council.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.896
So they have not yet built anything,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.696
but it might just be
that they use one of these plans

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.056
made with the game

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.120
to actually build the real city.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.776
And these videos that I have shown you,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.400
these are the people who are
coming up with new kinds of solutions.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.856
We know that cities are growing.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.336
They're getting bigger as we go,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.576
and the percentage of population
living in cities is projected to rise.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.496
So we need the solutions

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.216
and these people, playing the game,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.896
they are trying out
different kinds of solutions.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.600
They might have something
that is really important.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.440
So what we are seeing here is dream cities
that might be real one day.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.976
So it might be

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.840
that this is not just a game.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.656
It might be a way

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.840
to decide our own fate.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.136
Thank you.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.840
(Applause)
