00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.944
I'm really excited to share with you

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:17.534
some findings that really surprise me

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:20.085
about what makes companies 
succeed the most,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:23.987
what factors actually matter the most
for startup success.

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.212
I believe that the startup organization

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:30.970
is one of the greatest forms
to make the world a better place.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.756
If you take a group of people 
with the right equity incentives

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:36.635
and organize them in a startup,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.609
you can unlock human potential
in a way never before possible.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.139
You get them to achieve 
unbelievable things.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.799
But if the startup 
organization is so great,

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.281
why do so many fail?

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.878
That's what I wanted to find out.

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:51.363
I wanted to find out what
actually matters most

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:52.573
for startup success.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.782
And I wanted to try 
to be systematic about it,

00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:57.935
avoid some of my instincts
and maybe misperceptions I have

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.201
from so many companies
I've seen over the years.

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.428
I wanted to know this

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.476
because I've been starting businesses
since I was 12 years old

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:07.131
when I sold candy at the bus stop
in junior high school,

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:09.442
to high school, when I made
solar energy devices,

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:11.229
to college, when I made loudspeakers.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.255
And when I graduated from college,
I started software companies.

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.064
And 20 years ago,
I started Idealab,

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:19.305
and in the last 20 years,
we started more than 100 companies,

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.629
many successes, and many big failures.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:23.458
We learned a lot from those failures.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:26.735
So I tried to look across what factors

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.898
accounted the most for company
success and failure.

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.458
So I looked at these five.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.418
First, the idea.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:34.574
I used to think that 
the idea was everything.

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.881
I named my company Idealab
for how much I worship

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.474
the "aha!" moment when you first
come up with the idea.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.385
But then over time,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:43.970
I came to think that maybe the team,
the execution, adaptability,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.121
that mattered even more than the idea.

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:50.483
I never thought I'd be quoting
boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:52.342
but he once said,

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:56.945
"Everybody has a plan, until they get
punched in the face." (Laughter)

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.864
And I think that's so true
about business as well.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:02.140
So much about a team's execution

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.900
is its ability to adapt to getting punched
in the face by the customer.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.588
The customer is the true reality.

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:09.039
And that's why I came to think

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.556
that the team maybe
was the most important thing.

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:14.148
Then I started looking
at the business model.

00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:17.398
Does the company have a very clear path
generating customer revenues?

00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:19.502
That started rising to the top
in my thinking

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:21.819
about maybe what mattered
most for success.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.216
Then I looked at the funding.

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:25.916
Sometimes companies received
intense amounts of funding.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.754
Maybe that's the most important thing?

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:29.300
And then of course,
the timing.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.110
Is the idea way too early and
the world's not ready for it?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.557
Is it early, as in, you're in advance
and you have to educate the world?

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:36.366
Is it just right?

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.229
Or is it too late, and there's
already too many competitors?

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.818
So I tried to look very carefully
at these five factors

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:42.869
across many companies.

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.064
And I looked across all 100
Idealab companies,

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:46.518
and 100 non-Idealab companies

00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:49.154
to try and come up with 
something scientific about it.

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:51.899
So first, on these Idealab companies,

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.772
the top five companies --

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:57.188
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,
NetZero, Tickets.com --

00:02:57.188 --> 00:02:59.262
those all became billion-dollar successes.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.175
And the five companies on the bottom --

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.985
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,
Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.376
we all had high hopes for,
but didn't succeed.

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:09.833
So I tried to rank across all 
of those attributes

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:13.075
how I felt those companies scored
on each of those dimensions.

00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:16.540
And then for non-Idealab companies,
I looked at wild successes,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.122
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber
and Youtube and LinkedIn.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.385
And some failures:

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:23.185
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:24.465
Flooz and Friendster.

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:26.469
The bottom companies had intense funding,

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.548
they even had business models
in some cases,

00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:29.695
but they didn't succeed.

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:32.556
I tried to look at what factors
actually accounted the most

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:35.109
for success and failure across
all of these companies,

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.938
and the results really surprised me.

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:39.008
The number one thing was timing.

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:42.140
Timing accounted for 42 percent

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.640
of the difference
between success and failure.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.742
Team and execution came in second,

00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:47.564
and the idea,

00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:50.481
the differentiability of the idea,
the uniqueness of the idea,

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:51.884
that actually came in third.

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:53.849
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.066
it's not to say that 
the idea isn't important,

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:59.706
but it very much surprised me that
the idea wasn't the most important thing.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.306
Sometimes it mattered more when 
it was actually timed.

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:05.681
The last two, business model and funding,
made sense to me actually.

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.048
I think business model
makes sense to be that low

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.428
because you can start out
without a business model

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:13.895
and add one later if your customers
are demanding what you're creating.

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:15.301
And funding, I think as well,

00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:18.076
if you're underfunded at first
but you're gaining traction,

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:19.365
especially in today's age,

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:21.426
it's very, very easy to get
intense funding.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:24.546
So now let me give you some specific
examples about each of these.

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:27.459
So take a wild success like Airbnb
that everybody knows about.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.524
Well, that company was famously
passed on by many smart investors

00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:31.666
because people thought,

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:34.719
"No one's going to rent out a space
in their home to a stranger."

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:36.444
Of course, people proved that wrong.

00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:38.298
But one of the reasons it succeeded,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:41.283
aside from a good business model,
a good idea, great execution,

00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:42.020
is the timing.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.299
That company came out
right during the height of the recession

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:47.117
when people really needed extra money,

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:48.931
and that maybe helped people overcome

00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:51.777
their objection to renting out
their own home to a stranger.

00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:52.896
Same thing with Uber.

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:53.949
Uber came out,

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.110
incredible company,
incredible business model,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.174
great execution, too.

00:04:57.174 --> 00:04:58.656
But the timing was so perfect

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.805
for their need to get drivers
into the system.

00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:03.927
Drivers were looking for extra money;
it was very, very important.

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:07.705
Some of our early successes, Citysearch,
came out when people needed web pages.

00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:10.182
GoTo.com, which we announced
actually at TED in 1998,

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:13.513
was when companies were looking for
cost-effective ways to get traffic.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.085
We thought the idea was so great,

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.846
but actually, the timing was probably
maybe more important.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:19.284
And then some of our failures.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:22.761
We started a company called Z.com,
it was an online entertainment company.

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.204
We were so excited about it --

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:26.746
we raised enough money,
we had a great business model,

00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:29.994
we even signed incredibly great
Hollywood talent to join the company.

00:05:29.994 --> 00:05:32.382
But broadband penetration
was too low in 1999-2000.

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:34.538
It was too hard to watch
video content online,

00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:37.347
you had to put codecs in your browser
and do all this stuff,

00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:39.978
and the company eventually
went out of business in 2003.

00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:41.074
Just two years later,

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.959
when the codec problem
was solved by Adobe Flash

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:47.633
and when broadband penetration
crossed 50 percent in America,

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.590
YouTube was perfectly timed.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.319
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.759
In fact, YouTube didn't even have
a business model when it first started.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.042
It wasn't even certain that 
that would work out.

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:59.177
But that was beautifully, 
beautifully timed.

00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:00.728
So what I would say, in summary,

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.513
is execution definitely matters a lot.

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:04.757
The idea matters a lot.

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:06.516
But timing might matter even more.

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:08.562
And the best way to really assess timing

00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:11.179
is to really look at whether 
consumers are really ready

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:12.715
for what you have to offer them.

00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:14.677
And to be really, really honest about it,

00:06:14.677 --> 00:06:16.938
not be in denial about
any results that you see,

00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:20.149
because if you have something you love,
you want to push it forward,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.219
but you have to be very, very honest
about that factor on timing.

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:24.089
As I said earlier,

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.478
I think startups can change the world
and make the world a better place.

00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:28.876
I hope some of these insights

00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:31.528
can maybe help you
have a slightly higher success ratio,

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:33.748
and thus make something great
come to the world

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:35.594
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:37.931
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.425
(Applause)
