00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:14.230
You may be wondering

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.064
why a marine biologist from Oceana

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.904
would come here today to talk to you

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:19.140
about world hunger.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.291
I'm here today because

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.526
saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.670
It's more than a thing we're doing

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.468
because we want to create jobs for fishermen

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:30.552
or preserve fishermen's jobs.

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:33.900
It's more than an economic pursuit.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.512
Saving the oceans can feed the world.

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:38.338
Let me show you how.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.140
As you know, there are already

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.766
more than a billion hungry people on this planet.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.116
We're expecting that problem to get worse

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.546
as world population grows to nine billion

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.410
or 10 billion by midcentury,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.388
and we can expect to have greater pressure

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:54.246
on our food resources.

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:55.290
And this is a big concern,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.956
especially considering where we are now.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:00.668
Now we know that our arable land per capita

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:02.096
is already on the decline

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:04.805
in both developed and developing countries.

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.460
We know that we're headed for climate change,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.876
which is going to change rainfall patterns,

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:13.186
making some areas drier, as you can see in orange,

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:15.497
and others wetter, in blue,

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:17.240
causing droughts in our breadbaskets,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.090
in places like the Midwest and Central Europe,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.372
and floods in others.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.134
It's going to make it harder for the land

00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:24.690
to help us solve the hunger problem.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.154
And that's why the oceans need
to be their most abundant,

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.728
so that the oceans can provide us

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:31.321
as much food as possible.

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.968
And that's something the oceans have been doing

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:35.610
for us for a long time.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.290
As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.233
in the amount of food we've been able to harvest

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.897
from our oceans.

00:01:41.897 --> 00:01:44.385
It just seemed like it was continuing to increase,

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:45.789
until about 1980,

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.585
when we started to see a decline.

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.183
You've heard of peak oil.

00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:52.170
Maybe this is peak fish.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.970
I hope not. I'm going to come back to that.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.473
But you can see about an 18-percent decline

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:59.425
in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:00.780
since 1980.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.040
And this is a big problem. It's continuing.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.397
This red line is continuing to go down.

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:07.493
But we know how to turn it around,

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.183
and that's what I'm going to talk about today.

00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:11.583
We know how to turn that curve back upwards.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:14.030
This doesn't have to be peak fish.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.219
If we do a few simple things in targeted places,

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.702
we can bring our fisheries back and use them

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:21.966
to feed people.

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.886
First we want to know where the fish are,

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:25.457
so let's look where the fish are.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.351
It turns out the fish, conveniently,

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:29.567
are located for the most part

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.630
in our coastal areas of the countries,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.935
in coastal zones,

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.339
and these are areas that national jurisdictions

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:36.721
have control over,

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.545
and they can manage their fisheries

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.204
in these coastal areas.

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:42.462
Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.070
that go out about 200 nautical miles,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.441
in areas that are called exclusive economic zones,

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.434
and this is a good thing that they can control

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:51.595
their fisheries in these areas,

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:53.111
because the high seas,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:55.404
which are the darker areas on this map,

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:57.603
the high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,

00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:59.692
because it has to be done internationally.

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.559
You get into international agreements,

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.807
and if any of you are tracking
the climate change agreement,

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:05.519
you know this can be a very slow,

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.501
frustrating, tedious process.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:09.223
And so controlling things nationally

00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:11.997
is a great thing to be able to do.

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:14.194
How many fish are actually in these coastal areas

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.771
compared to the high seas?

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:17.281
Well, you can see here about

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:20.364
seven times as many fish in the coastal areas

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:21.951
than there are in the high seas,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.167
so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.311
because we can actually get a lot done.

00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:28.701
We can restore a lot of our fisheries

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:30.895
if we focus in these coastal areas.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.919
But how many of these countries
do we have to work in?

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.521
There's something like 80 coastal countries.

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.507
Do we have to fix fisheries management

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:38.910
in all of those countries?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.032
So we asked ourselves, how many countries

00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:42.439
do we need to focus on,

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.301
keeping in mind that the European Union

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:45.870
conveniently manages its fisheries

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.237
through a common fisheries policy?

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:50.529
So if we got good fisheries management

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.794
in the European Union and,
say, nine other countries,

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.883
how much of our fisheries would we be covering?

00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.940
Turns out, European Union plus nine countries

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.054
covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.333
If we took it up to 24 countries
plus the European Union,

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.055
we would up to 90 percent,

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:10.265
almost all of the world's fish catch.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:13.193
So we think we can work in
a limited number of places

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:14.885
to make the fisheries come back.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:17.497
But what do we have to do in these places?

00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:19.292
Well, based on our work in the United States

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.880
and elsewhere, we know that there are

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.721
three key things we have to do

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.427
to bring fisheries back, and they are:

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:27.373
We need to set quotas or limits

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.480
on how much we take;

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.273
we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:34.609
catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.459
and it's very wasteful;

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:39.123
and three, we need to protect habitats,

00:04:39.123 --> 00:04:41.240
the nursery areas, the spawning areas

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.810
that these fish need to grow
and reproduce successfully

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.660
so that they can rebuild their populations.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.422
If we do those three things, we 
know the fisheries will come back.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.770
How do we know?

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.785
We know because we've seen it happening

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.213
in a lot of different places.

00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:55.654
This is a slide that shows

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:57.852
the herring population in Norway

00:04:57.852 --> 00:05:00.175
that was crashing since the 1950s.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.326
It was coming down, and when Norway set limits,

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:05.244
or quotas, on its fishery, what happens?

00:05:05.244 --> 00:05:07.110
The fishery comes back.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.010
This is another example, also
happens to be from Norway,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.468
of the Norwegian Arctic cod.

00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:14.524
Same deal. The fishery is crashing.

00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:16.484
They set limits on discards.

00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:18.598
Discards are these fish they weren't targeting

00:05:18.598 --> 00:05:21.200
and they get thrown overboard wastefully.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.812
When they set the discard limit,

00:05:22.812 --> 00:05:24.868
the fishery came back.

00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:26.135
And it's not just in Norway.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:28.094
We've seen this happening in countries

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:31.153
all around the world, time and time again.

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:32.686
When these countries step in and they

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:35.820
put in sustainable fisheries management policies,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.636
the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:40.574
are starting to come back.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:42.432
So there's a lot of promise here.

00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:44.124
What does this mean for the world fish catch?

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:46.460
This means that if we take that fishery catch

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.490
that's on the decline

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.878
and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:53.416
up to 100 million metric tons per year.

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.389
So we didn't have peak fish yet.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.916
We still have an opportunity

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.217
to not only bring the fish back

00:05:58.217 --> 00:05:59.920
but to actually get more fish

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.371
that can feed more people

00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.873
than we currently are now.

00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:04.979
How many more? Right about now,

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.860
we can feed about 450 million people

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.834
a fish meal a day

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:11.084
based on the current world fish catch,

00:06:11.084 --> 00:06:13.548
which, of course, you know is going down,

00:06:13.548 --> 00:06:15.203
so that number will go down over time

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:16.806
if we don't fix it,

00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:19.216
but if we put fishery management practices

00:06:19.216 --> 00:06:21.780
like the ones I've described in place

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.885
in 10 to 25 countries,

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.364
we could bring that number up

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:28.918
and feed as many as 700 million people a year

00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:30.466
a healthy fish meal.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.008
We should obviously do this just because

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:35.000
it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.177
but it's also cost-effective.

00:06:36.177 --> 00:06:40.524
It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein

00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:41.900
on the planet.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.030
If you look at how much fish protein you get

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.030
per dollar invested

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.762
compared to all of the other animal proteins,

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:50.692
obviously, fish is a good business decision.

00:06:50.692 --> 00:06:52.292
It also doesn't need a lot of land,

00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:53.758
something that's in short supply,

00:06:53.758 --> 00:06:57.276
compared to other protein sources.

00:06:57.276 --> 00:06:59.907
And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.

00:06:59.907 --> 00:07:01.979
It uses a lot less fresh water than,

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.020
for example, cattle,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.174
where you have to irrigate a field

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:08.317
so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.

00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:10.436
It also has a very low carbon footprint.

00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:12.316
It has a little bit of a carbon footprint

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:14.315
because we do have to get out and catch the fish.

00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:15.810
It takes a little bit of fuel,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.032
but as you know, agriculture
can have a carbon footprint,

00:07:18.032 --> 00:07:19.586
and fish has a much smaller one,

00:07:19.586 --> 00:07:21.360
so it's less polluting.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.741
It's already a big part of our diet,

00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:25.830
but it can be a bigger part of our diet,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.561
which is a good thing, because we know

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.186
that it's healthy for us.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.511
It can reduce our risks of cancer,

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.400
heart disease and obesity.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.371
In fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.960
who is the originator of this concept, actually,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.880
he likes to say fish is the perfect protein.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.130
Andy also talks about the fact that

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.636
our ocean conservation movement really grew

00:07:46.636 --> 00:07:48.868
out of the land conservation movement,

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.360
and in land conservation,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.424
we have this problem where biodiversity

00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:56.424
is at war with food production.

00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:59.215
You have to cut down the biodiverse forest

00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:01.108
if you want to get the field

00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:03.338
to grow the corn to feed people with,

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:05.180
and so there's a constant push-pull there.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.728
There's a constant tough decision

00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:08.567
that has to be made between

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:10.588
two very important things:

00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:13.681
maintaining biodiversity and feeding people.

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:15.981
But in the oceans, we don't have that war.

00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:18.538
In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:19.700
with abundance.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.805
In fact, they're aligned.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.978
When we do things that produce biodiversity,

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:27.030
we actually get more abundance,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.846
and that's important so that we can feed people.

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:33.576
Now, there's a catch.

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:36.121
Didn't anyone get that? (Laughter)

00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:38.164
Illegal fishing.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:39.730
Illegal fishing undermines the type of

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.980
sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.460
It can be when you catch fish using gears

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.489
that have been prohibited,

00:08:45.489 --> 00:08:48.140
when you fish in places where
you're not supposed to fish,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.378
you catch fish that are the wrong
size or the wrong species.

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:53.343
Illegal fishing cheats the consumer

00:08:53.343 --> 00:08:55.550
and it also cheats honest fishermen,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.710
and it needs to stop.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.787
The way illegal fish get into our 
market is through seafood fraud.

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:01.236
You might have heard about this.

00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:04.420
It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.955
Think about the last time you had fish.

00:09:05.955 --> 00:09:06.745
What were you eating?

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.516
Are you sure that's what it was?

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:11.240
Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.482
and about a third of them

00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:14.220
were not what they were labeled to be.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.960
Snappers, nine out of 10
snappers were not snapper.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.180
Fifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.150
was mislabeled.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.778
And red snapper, we tested 120 samples,

00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:25.694
and only seven of them were really red snapper,

00:09:25.694 --> 00:09:29.238
so good luck finding a red snapper.

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:31.466
Seafood has a really complex supply chain,

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:33.762
and at every step in this supply chain,

00:09:33.762 --> 00:09:35.952
there's an opportunity for seafood fraud,

00:09:35.952 --> 00:09:38.080
unless we have traceability.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.799
Traceability is a way where the seafood industry

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:43.096
can track the seafood from the boat to the plate

00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:45.627
to make sure that the consumer can then find out

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.274
where their seafood came from.

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:49.030
This is a really important thing.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.598
It's being done by some in
the industry, but not enough,

00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:52.945
so we're pushing a law in Congress

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:54.351
called the SAFE Seafood Act,

00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:56.990
and I'm very excited today to announce the release

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.634
of a chef's petition, where 450 chefs

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:02.306
have signed a petition calling on Congress

00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:04.508
to support the SAFE Seafood Act.

00:10:04.508 --> 00:10:06.336
It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know --

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:09.540
Anthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.216
Barton Seaver and others —

00:10:11.216 --> 00:10:12.970
and they've signed it because they believe

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.298
that people have a right to know

00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:16.673
about what they're eating.

00:10:16.673 --> 00:10:21.856
(Applause)

00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:24.420
Fishermen like it too, so there's a good chance

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.020
we can get the kind of support we need

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.954
to get this bill through,

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:28.478
and it comes at a critical time,

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:30.584
because this is the way we stop seafood fraud,

00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:32.650
this is the way we curb illegal fishing,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.522
and this is the way we make sure

00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:36.226
that quotas, habitat protection,

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:38.106
and bycatch reductions can do the jobs

00:10:38.106 --> 00:10:39.283
they can do.

00:10:39.283 --> 00:10:42.459
We know that we can manage
our fisheries sustainably.

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.101
We know that we can produce

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:47.870
healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.115
that don't use the land, that don't use much water,

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:51.300
have a low carbon footprint,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.102
and are cost-effective.

00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:55.090
We know that saving the oceans

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.673
can feed the world,

00:10:56.673 --> 00:10:59.060
and we need to start now.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.817
(Applause)

00:11:01.817 --> 00:11:05.525
Thank you. (Applause)
