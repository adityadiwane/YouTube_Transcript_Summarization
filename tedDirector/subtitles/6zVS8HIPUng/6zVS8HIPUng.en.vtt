00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:18.837
Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.887
that the vast majority of brain development

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.866
takes place in the first few years of life.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.578
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability

00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:29.199
to look inside the living human brain

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.237
and track development across the lifespan.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.398
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:37.203
in brain imaging technology

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.146
such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.273
neuroscientists have started to look inside the living

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:45.692
human brain of all ages, and to track changes

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:48.563
in brain structure and brain function,

00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:52.240
so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.302
a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:58.522
of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,

00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.962
how much gray matter does the brain contain,

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.765
and how does that change with age?

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.477
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:09.872
to take a video, a movie, of brain activity

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:12.740
when participants are taking part in some kind of task

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.632
like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:18.398
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:20.628
of research, and we now have a really rich

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:24.152
and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:27.220
and this picture has radically changed the way

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.853
we think about human brain development

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:32.621
by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:35.332
and instead, the brain continues to develop

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:39.378
right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:43.357
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts

00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:47.753
with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.038
and ends at the age at which an individual attains

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.489
a stable, independent role in society.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.279
(Laughter)

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.044
It can go on a long time. (Laughter)

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:02.063
One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:05.327
during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:08.304
So this is a model of the human brain,

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:11.184
and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:13.693
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:16.807
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:20.434
in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.722
high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.812
planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.552
or next week or next year, inhibiting

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:31.218
inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:34.143
something really rude or doing something really stupid.

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:35.921
It's also involved in social interaction,

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:39.045
understanding other people, and self-awareness.

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:42.095
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.565
have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.498
during the period of adolescence.

00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:50.456
So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:55.305
gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.627
increases during childhood, which is what you can see

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:01.380
on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.945
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume

00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:07.411
in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:10.921
a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:12.760
and that's probably because boys go through puberty

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.012
a couple of years later than girls on average,

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:18.447
and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:21.132
in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:23.157
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:26.307
a really important developmental process, because

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:30.413
gray matter contains cell bodies and connections

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:33.867
between cells, the synapses, and this decline

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.612
in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.504
is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,

00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.827
the elimination of unwanted synapses.

00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:44.960
This is a really important process. It's partly dependent

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.094
on the environment that the animal or the human is in,

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.538
and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:53.471
and synapses that aren't being used

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.803
in that particular environment are pruned away.

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:58.309
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.149
You prune away the weaker branches so that

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.187
the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,

00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:08.113
and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.780
according to the species-specific environment,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.695
is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:17.249
during the period of human adolescence.

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.950
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.202
in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:27.475
to look at changes in brain activity across age.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.117
So I'll just give you an example from my lab.

00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:32.678
So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:36.262
the network of brain regions that we use to understand

00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:38.695
other people and to interact with other people.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:42.461
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game

00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.868
to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:48.301
So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)

00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:50.943
Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying

00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:53.745
on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:56.704
that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic

00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:59.754
and instinctive social emotional responses are,

00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:02.718
so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,

00:05:02.718 --> 00:05:04.528
everyone is doing the same thing with their arms

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:06.331
and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.155
as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:10.424
with his arms, and presumably has a similar

00:05:10.424 --> 00:05:12.398
facial expression, and the only people who don't

00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:15.859
are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:18.402
and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.697
and they're doing another social emotional response

00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:23.332
that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect

00:05:23.332 --> 00:05:26.968
of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:30.350
how good we are at reading other people's behavior,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.027
their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,

00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:36.843
in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.

00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:38.620
So you don't have to ask any of these guys.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.161
You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.749
and thinking at this precise moment in time.

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.505
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:49.077
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:51.478
to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.772
that involves thinking about other people, their minds,

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:57.666
their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings

00:05:57.666 --> 00:06:00.512
that we've found several times now, as have other labs

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:03.730
around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.948
medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,

00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:09.704
and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:12.102
in the midline of your head.

00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:15.385
This region is more active in adolescents when they make

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:17.512
these social decisions and think about other people

00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:20.313
than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.553
of nine different studies in this area from labs around

00:06:23.553 --> 00:06:26.253
the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.623
in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.070
during the period of adolescence.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.714
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults

00:06:34.714 --> 00:06:37.080
use a different mental approach, a different

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.498
cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:44.014
and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies

00:06:44.014 --> 00:06:45.991
whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them

00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:48.535
some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you

00:06:48.535 --> 00:06:51.745
another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.393
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:56.118
experiments. You come into the lab,

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.792
you see this computerized task.

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:01.582
In this task, you see a set of shelves.

00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:04.399
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.370
and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.955
of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:13.234
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:15.878
gray piece of wood.

00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:19.362
This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.

00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:22.855
Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,

00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:25.307
whereas there are many more objects that you can see.

00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:27.503
Now your task is to move objects around.

00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:29.865
The director, standing behind the set of shelves,

00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:32.610
is going to direct you to move objects around,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.504
but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:38.224
that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.417
condition whereby there's a kind of conflict

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.585
between your perspective and the director's perspective.

00:07:43.585 --> 00:07:46.825
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:48.856
There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.021
go for the white truck, because that's the top truck

00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:53.839
from your perspective, but then you have to remember,

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.898
"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean

00:07:55.898 --> 00:07:58.655
me to move the blue truck," which is the top truck

00:07:58.655 --> 00:08:01.300
from his perspective. Now believe it or not,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.251
normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:07.391
about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.234
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.

00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:13.550
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.104
and we also have a control condition

00:08:15.104 --> 00:08:19.165
where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.079
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.916
but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to

00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:27.123
ignore objects with the dark gray background.

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:29.823
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only

00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:32.669
in the no-director condition they just have to remember

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.740
to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.420
in the director condition, they have to remember

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.961
to take into account the director's perspective

00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:45.258
in order to guide their ongoing behavior.

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:47.868
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors

00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:50.434
in a large developmental study we did,

00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:53.988
this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,

00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:55.198
and what you're going to see is the percentage errors

00:08:55.198 --> 00:08:57.172
in the adult group in both conditions,

00:08:57.187 --> 00:09:00.458
so the gray is the director condition, and you see

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:03.031
that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.746
of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.774
when there's no director present, when they just have

00:09:07.774 --> 00:09:10.855
to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:13.523
Developmentally, these two conditions develop

00:09:13.523 --> 00:09:16.446
in exactly the same way. Between late childhood

00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:18.687
and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:22.038
in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,

00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:23.158
in both of these conditions.

00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:25.443
But it's when you compare the last two groups,

00:09:25.443 --> 00:09:27.395
the mid-adolescent group and the adult group

00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:30.555
where things get really interesting, because there, there is

00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:33.593
no continued improvement in the no-director condition.

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:36.523
In other words, everything you need to do in order to

00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:39.229
remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:41.760
by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.157
if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still

00:09:44.157 --> 00:09:47.307
a significant improvement in the director condition

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.748
between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what

00:09:49.748 --> 00:09:53.124
this means is that the ability to take into account someone

00:09:53.124 --> 00:09:56.409
else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,

00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:58.668
which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:03.274
the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:05.814
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.223
sometimes think they have problems taking other people's

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:11.979
perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:15.492
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.

00:10:15.492 --> 00:10:19.355
They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media

00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:22.882
for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,

00:10:22.882 --> 00:10:25.653
they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.

00:10:25.653 --> 00:10:28.146
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine

00:10:28.146 --> 00:10:30.633
who said that the thing he noticed most

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:33.614
about his teenage daughters before and after puberty

00:10:33.614 --> 00:10:35.858
was their level of embarrassment in front of him.

00:10:35.874 --> 00:10:38.363
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters

00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:40.617
were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,

00:10:40.617 --> 00:10:42.366
stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.267
and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing

00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:47.738
their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.

00:10:47.738 --> 00:10:49.555
(Laughter)

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:53.032
The very notion of their dad singing in public

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:55.395
was enough to make them behave.

00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:56.823
So people often ask,

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.456
"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?

00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:01.578
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:04.246
And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:07.669
of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:09.826
very similar to the descriptions we use today.

00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:14.059
So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:16.834
where he describes adolescence as follows:

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:19.680
"I would there were no age between ten and

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.920
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.011
for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches

00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:31.234
with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:35.768
He then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any

00:11:35.768 --> 00:11:38.913
but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty

00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:41.411
hunt in this weather?" (Laughter)

00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:44.337
So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:47.061
adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:50.520
portray them in today, but today we try to understand

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.607
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes

00:11:53.607 --> 00:11:55.545
that are going on in their brain.

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:59.153
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:01.478
have a tendency to take risks. They do.

00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:04.110
They take more risks than children or adults,

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.570
and they are particularly prone to taking risks

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.538
when they're with their friends. There's an important drive

00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:12.024
to become independent from one's parents

00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:14.848
and to impress one's friends in adolescence.

00:12:14.848 --> 00:12:17.447
But now we try to understand that in terms of

00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.440
the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.983
so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red

00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:24.848
in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.

00:12:24.848 --> 00:12:27.957
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,

00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:31.690
and it's involved in things like emotion processing

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.840
and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.136
out of doing fun things, including taking risks.

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:40.501
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.

00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:43.549
And this region, the regions within the limbic system,

00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:46.968
have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding

00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:50.737
feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:54.439
and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:56.713
which you can see in blue in the slide here,

00:12:56.713 --> 00:12:59.580
which stops us taking excessive risks,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.978
is still very much in development in adolescents.

00:13:02.978 --> 00:13:06.645
So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:09.987
undergoes really quite profound development,

00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:13.943
and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,

00:13:13.943 --> 00:13:17.963
and intervention. The environment, including teaching,

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:21.372
can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,

00:13:21.372 --> 00:13:24.174
and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been

00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:26.679
routinely educating teenagers in the West.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:30.432
All four of my grandparents, for example, left school

00:13:30.432 --> 00:13:34.266
in their early adolescence. They had no choice.

00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:37.040
And that's still the case for many, many teenagers

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.207
around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers

00:13:40.207 --> 00:13:44.429
don't have access to secondary school education.

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:47.068
And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is

00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:49.915
particularly adaptable and malleable.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:53.685
It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.

00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:55.918
So what's sometimes seen as the problem

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.394
with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse

00:13:58.394 --> 00:14:02.336
control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.

00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:05.173
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide

00:14:05.173 --> 00:14:08.087
an excellent opportunity for education

00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:12.517
and social development. Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:12.517 --> 00:14:20.287
