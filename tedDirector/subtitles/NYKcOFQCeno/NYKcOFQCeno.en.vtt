00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
you'll see a little bit of a relation.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.330
It ties to origami. So let me start.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
What is origami?

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And that is what origami used to be.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
But it's become something else.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
The common theme -- what makes it origami --

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
is folding is how we create the form.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
It shows these women playing with these toys.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
Every Japanese kid

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
learns how to fold that crane.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
So this art has been around for hundreds of years,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
and you would think something

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
And that might have been the case.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
But in the twentieth century,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
and he created tens of thousands of new designs.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
But even more importantly, he created a language,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
a way we could communicate,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
a code of dots, dashes and arrows.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
we now have a means of transmitting information

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
with heredity and selection,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
and we know where that leads.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And where it has led in origami

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
is to things like this.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
This is an origami figure --

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
This, too, is origami,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Naturalism. Detail.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
You can get horns, antlers --

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
even, if you look close, cloven hooves.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
And it raises a question: what changed?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
And what changed is something

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
you might not have expected in an art,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
which is math.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
That is, people applied mathematical principles

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
to the art,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
to discover the underlying laws.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
And that leads to a very powerful tool.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
The secret to productivity in so many fields --

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
and in origami --

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
is letting dead people do your work for you.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.330
(Laughter)

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Because what you can do is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
take your problem,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
and use their solutions.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
Origami revolves around crease patterns.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
for an origami figure.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
They have to obey four simple laws.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And they're very simple, easy to understand.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
with just two colors without ever having

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
the same color meeting.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
The directions of the folds at any vertex --

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
always differs by two. Two more or two less.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Nothing else.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
If you look at the angles around the fold,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
you find that if you number the angles in a circle,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
And if you look at how the layers stack,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
a sheet can never

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
penetrate a fold.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
All of origami comes from that.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
give rise to that kind of complexity?"

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
can be written down on a napkin,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
and yet they govern all of chemistry,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
all of life, all of history.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
If we obey these laws,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
we can do amazing things.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
So in origami, to obey these laws,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
we can take simple patterns --

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
and by itself it's nothing.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.330
But if we follow the laws of origami,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
we can put these patterns into another fold

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
that itself might be something very, very simple,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
but when we put it together,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
we get something a little different.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
This fish, 400 scales --

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
you can back off and just do a few things,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
on a flag, with 13 stripes.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
And if you want to go really crazy,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And this guy's on display downstairs,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
so take a look if you get a chance.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
The most powerful tools in origami

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
have related to how we get parts of creatures.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
And I can put it in this simple equation.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
We take an idea,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
(Laughter)

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.330
it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
And yeah, you really can.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
into a few smaller steps.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
So let me stretch out that equation.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
I start with my idea. I abstract it.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
that has a part for every bit of the subject,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
a flap for every leg.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
you can turn it into the finished shape.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Now the first step, pretty easy.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
going from the abstract description to the folded shape --

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
that's hard.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
can get us over the hump.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And I'm going to show you all how to do that

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
so you can go out of here and fold something.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
But we're going to start small.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
This base has a lot of flaps in it.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
We're going to learn how to make one flap.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
How would you make a single flap?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
until it gets long and narrow,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
What paper went into that flap?

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
you can see that the upper left corner of that shape

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
is the paper that went into the flap.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
I can use it for something else.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
There are other dimensions for flaps.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
If I make the flap as skinny as possible,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
There's other ways of making flaps.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
So, no matter how I make a flap,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
it needs some part

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
of a circular region of paper.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So now we're ready to scale up.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
And in the 1990s,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
origami artists discovered these principles

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
just by packing circles.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.330
And here's where the dead people start to help us out,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
because lots of people have studied

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
the problem of packing circles.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
looking at disc packings and arrangements.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
And it's so simple.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
(Laughter)

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
It's so simple that a computer could do it.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
in very basic terms, and with this, we could.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
(Laughter)

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
And you just draw a stick figure,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
and it calculates the crease pattern.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
you'll get this crease pattern.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
you'll get a base that you can then shape

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
into a deer,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
And if you want a different deer,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
you change the packing,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
and you can do an elk.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
Or you could do a moose.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
Or, really, any other kind of deer.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
These techniques revolutionized this art.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
We found we could do insects,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
spiders, which are close,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
things with legs, things with legs and wings,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
things with legs and antennae.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
wasn't interesting enough,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
then you could do two praying mantises

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
from a single uncut square.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
She's eating him.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
I call it "Snack Time."

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
And you can do more than just insects.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
This -- you can put details,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
This tree frog has toes.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
Toes have become an origami meme,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
because everyone's doing it.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
You can make multiple subjects.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
The guitar player from a single square,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
the bass player from a single square.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
that's not so hot.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Do a little more complicated instrument."

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
Well, then you could do an organ.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
(Laughter)

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
And what this has allowed is the creation

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
of origami-on-demand.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
and you can go out and fold it.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
And sometimes you create high art,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
But I want to show you some examples.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
Everything you'll see here,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
except the car, is origami.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:51.330
(Video)

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
(Applause)

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
Computers made things move,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
but these were all real, folded objects that we made.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
And we can use this not just for visuals,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.330
Surprisingly, origami

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
and the structures that we've developed in origami

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
And I want to show you some of these examples.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
One of the earliest was this pattern,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
this folded pattern,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
He studied a folding pattern, and realized

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
this could fold down into an extremely compact package

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
that had a very simple opening and closing structure.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
And he used it to design this solar array.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
in 1995.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
Now, there is actually a little origami

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
The telescope, going up in space,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
it unfolds in two places.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
you wouldn't even call that origami.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
then you might need some origami.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
had an idea for a telescope much larger.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
They called it the Eyeglass.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
The design called for geosynchronous orbit

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
25,000 miles up,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
100-meter diameter lens.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
There were two groups of people who were interested in this:

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
planetary scientists, who want to look up,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
and then other people, who wanted to look down.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
Whether you look up or look down,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
So you have to do something like this.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
This was a small model.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
But this pattern's not going to work

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
So the Livermore engineers,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
wanting to make use of the work of dead people,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
or perhaps live origamists, said,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
So they looked into the origami community,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And we developed a pattern together

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
that scales to arbitrarily large size,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
but that allows any flat ring or disc

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
And they adopted that for their first generation,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
But this is a five-meter telescope --

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
has about a quarter-mile focal length.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
And it works perfectly on its test range,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
Now, there is other origami in space.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
and you can see here that the sail expands out,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
and you can still see the fold lines.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.330
The problem that's being solved here is

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
but needs to be small for the journey.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And that works whether you're going into space,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
or whether you're just going into a body.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
And this example is the latter.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
at Oxford University.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
through your blood vessels.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
based on a model called the water bomb base.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
Airbag designers also have the problem

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
of getting flat sheets

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
into a small space.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
And they want to do their design by simulation.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
So they need to figure out how, in a computer,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
to flatten an airbag.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
And the algorithms that we developed

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
to do insects

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
turned out to be the solution for airbags

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
to do their simulation.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And so they can do a simulation like this.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
Those are the origami creases forming,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
and now you can see the airbag inflate

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
and find out, does it work?

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
And that leads

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
to a really interesting idea.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
You know, where did these things come from?

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
Well, the heart stent

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
came from that little blow-up box

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
that you might have learned in elementary school.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
The airbag-flattening algorithm

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
came from all the developments

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
of circle packing and the mathematical theory

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
that was really developed

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
just to create insects -- things with legs.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
The thing is, that this often happens

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
in math and science.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
When you get math involved, problems that you solve

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
for aesthetic value only,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
or to create something beautiful,

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
turn around and turn out

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
to have an application in the real world.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
And as weird and surprising as it may sound,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
origami may someday even save a life.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
Thanks.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
(Applause)
