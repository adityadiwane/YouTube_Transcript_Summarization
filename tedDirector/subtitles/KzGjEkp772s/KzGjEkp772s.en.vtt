00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
How many Creationists do we have in the room?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's all right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The World Wide Web? Not so sure.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And yet people are interestingly resistant

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It climbs up to the top, and it falls,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What's in it for the ant?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Well then, why is it doing this?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Is it just a fluke?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's a little brain worm.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in order to continue its life cycle.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So there's nothing in it for the ant.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
inducing suicidal behavior.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Pretty scary.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Well, does anything like that happen with human beings?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, it may already have occurred to you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
No, it's worse than that.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Most people have.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There are a lot of ideas to die for.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Justice. Truth. Communism.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Many people have laid down their lives for communism,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They're infectious.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It was a term of abuse, in effect.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
This is unthinking engineering.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It's "infectious repetitis,"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so that we can understand the conditions of infection.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And you have to have a bumper sticker,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
you know. You have to have a statement.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So, this is mine.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and dedicate your life to it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
now we actually do this.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
One set of ideas or another

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is what our summum bonum is.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now, this is a profound biological effect.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And no other species does anything at all like it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Well, how are we going to think about this?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Unmistakable.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The idea of replicating ideas;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,"

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
in his book "The Selfish Gene."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Now here am I talking about his idea.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But it's everybody's idea now.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I'm responsible for what I say about memes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Actually, I think we're all responsible

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
for not just the intended effects of our ideas,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
but for their likely misuses.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that these ideas not be abused and misused.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And it's just about a full-time job

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So we have to keep plugging away,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
trying to correct the misapprehensions

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But it is a problem.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So let me just point out: memes are like viruses.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
That's what Richard said, back in '93.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And you might think, "Well, how can that be?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but -- what's a virus?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
(Laughter)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
That is, there is something about it

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Not silicon.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
What's a word made of?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
There are different species of memes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Simple, beautiful furniture?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And, of course, they're basically extinct now.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is that one should be celibate.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Not just the priests. Everybody.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But in fact that's not why they went extinct.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
They survived as long as they did

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And there were lots of widows and orphans,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
people like that, who needed a foster home.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And so they had a ready supply of converts.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And they could keep it going.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And, in principle, it could've gone on forever,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The idea being passed on through proselytizing,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
instead of through the gene line.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that they're not being passed on genetically.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It's part of their plan.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
They don't have to have minds to have a plan.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm just going to draw your attention to just one

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I've not time to go into more of it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,"

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that conquered the rest of the world.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
When European explorers and travelers spread out,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
they brought with them the germs

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that they had become essentially immune to,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that they had learned how to tolerate over

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
who had no immunity to them at all.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And we're doing it again.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
spoke about all the wonderful things

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that are happening when our ideas get spread out,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
thanks to all the new technology all over the world.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now, this has been realized for some time.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
These memes are spreading around the world

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and they are wiping out whole cultures.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They are wiping out languages.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They are wiping out traditions and practices.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to people that haven't developed the immunity.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They're like a mild cold.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
They're not a big deal for us.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But we should recognize that for many people in the world,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
they are a big deal.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And we should be very alert to this.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
As we spread our education and our technology,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000
one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
as a dire threat to their favorite memes --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the memes that they are prepared to die for.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
That is not the job of the science of memetics.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
This is not the place for hate and anger.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
But the way to deal with that is to do science,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Get the facts.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Work out the implications.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and can figure out the best thing to do.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
You will never annihilate the germs.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of the most toxic varieties.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
That's all the time I have,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
so thank you very much for your attention.
