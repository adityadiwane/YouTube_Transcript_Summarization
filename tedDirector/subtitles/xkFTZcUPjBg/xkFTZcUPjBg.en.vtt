00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:14.825
I'll begin today

00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:16.891
by sharing a poem

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.026
written by my friend from Malawi,

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:22.162
Eileen Piri.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:25.506
Eileen is only 13 years old,

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:31.380
but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.248
I found her poem so interesting,

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.245
so motivating.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.358
So I'll read it to you.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.503
She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want."

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:45.359
(Laughter)

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.890
"I'll marry when I want.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.790
My mother can't force me to marry.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.994
My father cannot force me to marry.

00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:00.336
My uncle, my aunt,

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.681
my brother or sister,

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:04.863
cannot force me to marry.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:08.254
No one in the world

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:11.550
can force me to marry.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.499
I'll marry when I want.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.077
Even if you beat me,

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.747
even if you chase me away,

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:22.928
even if you do anything bad to me,

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:26.364
I'll marry when I want.

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:29.267
I'll marry when I want,

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:33.005
but not before I am well educated,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.323
and not before I am all grown up.

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:39.810
I'll marry when I want."

00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.827
This poem might seem odd,

00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:47.356
written by a 13-year-old girl,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:52.139
but where I and Eileen come from,

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.900
this poem, which I have just read to you,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.616
is a warrior's cry.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.541
I am from Malawi.

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:07.115
Malawi is one of the poorest countries,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:09.994
very poor,

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:14.522
where gender equality is questionable.

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:16.844
Growing up in that country,

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:20.095
I couldn't make my own choices in life.

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.393
I couldn't even explore

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:25.389
personal opportunities in life.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.919
I will tell you a story

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.381
of two different girls,

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.026
two beautiful girls.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:36.580
These girls grew up

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.693
under the same roof.

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:41.410
They were eating the same food.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.173
Sometimes, they would share clothes,

00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:46.982
and even shoes.

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:51.649
But their lives ended up differently,

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.646
in two different paths.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.754
The other girl is my little sister.

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:03.677
My little sister was only 11 years old

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:06.329
when she got pregnant.

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.742
It's a hurtful thing.

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:16.633
Not only did it hurt her, even me.

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:20.232
I was going through a hard time as well.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:23.947
As it is in my culture,

00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:26.942
once you reach puberty stage,

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:30.820
you are supposed to go
to initiation camps.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.118
In these initiation camps,

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:36.973
you are taught how
to sexually please a man.

00:03:36.973 --> 00:03:38.761
There is this special day,

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:41.965
which they call "Very Special Day"

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:44.519
where a man who is hired
by the community

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.143
comes to the camp

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.572
and sleeps with the little girls.

00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:53.766
Imagine the trauma that these young girls

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.516
go through every day.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:01.925
Most girls end up pregnant.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.542
They even contract HIV and AIDS

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.882
and other sexually transmitted diseases.

00:04:07.692 --> 00:04:12.603
For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant.

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:16.666
Today, she's only 16 years old

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:19.662
and she has three children.

00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:23.307
Her first marriage did not survive,

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:26.604
nor did her second marriage.

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:30.781
On the other side, there is this girl.

00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:33.314
She's amazing.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.218
(Laughter)

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:38.163
(Applause)

00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:42.138
I call her amazing because she is.

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:45.203
She's very fabulous.

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:48.964
That girl is me. (Laughter)

00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:51.982
When I was 13 years old,

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:55.396
I was told, you are grown up,

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:58.228
you have now reached of age,

00:04:58.228 --> 00:05:01.595
you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp.

00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:04.567
I was like, "What?

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:08.549
I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps."

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.112
You know what the women said to me?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.734
"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:24.001
You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community."

00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.809
I said no because I knew
where I was going.

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.433
I knew what I wanted in life.

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:34.738
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:39.883
I wanted to get well educated,

00:05:39.883 --> 00:05:42.363
to find a decent job in the future.

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:44.122
I was imagining myself as a lawyer,

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:46.832
seated on that big chair.

00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:49.138
Those were the imaginations that

00:05:49.138 --> 00:05:52.468
were going through my mind every day.

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:54.302
And I knew that one day,

00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:58.876
I would contribute something,
a little something to my community.

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.407
But every day after refusing,

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.427
women would tell me,

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.817
"Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby.

00:06:06.817 --> 00:06:08.303
What about you?"

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:13.017
That was the music
that I was hearing every day,

00:06:13.017 --> 00:06:16.894
and that is the music
that girls hear every day

00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:21.043
when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do.

00:06:23.524 --> 00:06:27.448
When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister,

00:06:27.448 --> 00:06:32.185
I said, "Why can't I do something?

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:37.246
Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:39.661
in our community?"

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:42.169
That was when I called other girls

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.723
just like my sister, who have children,

00:06:44.723 --> 00:06:48.187
who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write.

00:06:48.187 --> 00:06:50.297
I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other

00:06:50.297 --> 00:06:52.432
how to read and write again,

00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:56.240
how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book."

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.885
It was a great time I had with them.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:04.157
Nor did I just learn a little about them,

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:07.594
but they were able to tell me
their personal stories,

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.405
what they were facing every day

00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:12.075
as young mothers.

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:14.072
That was when I was like,

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:17.996
'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:21.873
and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders,

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:23.870
that these are the wrong things?"

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.937
It was a scary thing to do,

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:27.910
because these traditional leaders,

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.114
they are already accustomed to the things

00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:32.554
that have been there for ages.

00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:34.481
A hard thing to change,

00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:37.105
but a good thing to try.

00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:39.357
So we tried.

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:41.865
It was very hard, but we pushed.

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:45.109
And I'm here to say that in my community,

00:07:45.109 --> 00:07:47.669
it was the first community after girls

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.036
pushed so hard to our traditional leader,

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:55.425
and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married

00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:57.654
before the age of 18.

00:07:57.654 --> 00:08:01.507
(Applause)

00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:07.243
In my community,

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:09.890
that was the first time a community,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.351
they had to call the bylaws,

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:15.858
the first bylaw that protected girls

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:18.052
in our community.

00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:19.840
We did not stop there.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.789
We forged ahead.

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:26.643
We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community,

00:08:26.643 --> 00:08:29.429
but even in other communities.

00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:33.562
When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February,

00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:37.208
we were there at the Parliament house.

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:41.294
Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering,

00:08:41.294 --> 00:08:44.383
we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?"

00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:49.142
And we don't have
much technology like here,

00:08:49.142 --> 00:08:51.139
but we have our small phones.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:56.169
So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?"

00:08:56.178 --> 00:08:59.428
So we did that. It was a good thing.

00:08:59.428 --> 00:09:01.448
(Applause)

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:04.421
So when the bill passed,
we texted them back,

00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:06.849
"Thank you for supporting the bill."

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:07.919
(Laughter)

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:11.264
And when the bill was signed
by the president,

00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:14.630
making it into law, it was a plus.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:20.482
Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18.

00:09:20.482 --> 00:09:24.127
(Applause)

00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:30.071
It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed,

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:33.113
but let me tell you this:

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:37.501
There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age,

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:41.773
but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day?

00:09:41.773 --> 00:09:47.416
Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away.

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:53.870
This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.239
In honoring this commitment,

00:09:56.239 --> 00:10:01.951
it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time.

00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.712
We don't have to be subjected as second,

00:10:05.712 --> 00:10:09.950
but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.000
we are not just women,
we are not just girls,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.980
we are extraordinary.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.893
We can do more.

00:10:16.893 --> 00:10:19.888
And another thing for Malawi,

00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:22.790
and not just Malawi but other countries:

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.575
The laws which are there,

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:32.426
you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced?

00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:35.839
The law which has just recently passed

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:38.463
and the laws that in other countries
have been there,

00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:42.387
they need to be publicized
at the local level,

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:44.570
at the community level,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.956
where girls' issues are very striking.

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:54.716
Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day.

00:10:55.274 --> 00:11:00.359
So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them,

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.145
they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves

00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:06.816
because they will know that
there is a law that protects them.

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:13.363
And another thing I would say is that

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:17.961
girls' voices and women's voices

00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.724
are beautiful, they are there,

00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:23.905
but we cannot do this alone.

00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:26.575
Male advocates, they have to jump in,

00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:28.525
to step in and work together.

00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:31.103
It's a collective work.

00:11:31.103 --> 00:11:33.843
What we need is what girls elsewhere need:

00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:39.601
good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11.

00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:44.953
And furthermore,

00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:48.018
I know that together,

00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:51.966
we can transform the legal,

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:55.135
the cultural and political framework

00:11:55.135 --> 00:11:59.906
that denies girls of their rights.

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:04.964
I am standing here today

00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:12.004
and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation.

00:12:12.677 --> 00:12:14.860
This is the moment

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.294
where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide,

00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:21.895
will be able to say,

00:12:21.895 --> 00:12:25.099
"I will marry when I want."

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:28.144
(Applause)

00:12:35.284 --> 00:12:37.219
Thank you. (Applause)
