00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
There's a poem written

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
by a very famous English poet

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
at the end of the 19th century.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
in the 1930s.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And the poem goes:

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
"On the idle hill of summer,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
lazy with the flow of streams,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
hark I hear a distant drummer,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
drumming like a sound in dreams,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
dear to friend and food to powder,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
soldiers marching,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
soon to die."

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Those who are interested in poetry,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
But what Housman understood,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
was that the long, hot, silvan summers

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
of stability of the 19th century

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
were coming to a close,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and that we were about to move

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
into one of those terrifying periods of history

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
when power changes.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
accompanied by turbulence,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and all too often by blood.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And my message for you

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
to live at just one of those moments in history

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
when the gimbals upon which

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
the established order of power is beginning to change

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and the new look of the world,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the new powers that exist in the world,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
are beginning to take form.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and all too often very bloody times.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
By the way, it happens about once every century.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
You might argue that the last time it happened --

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
was that when power passed from the old nations,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
the old powers of Europe,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
across the Atlantic to the new emerging power

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
of the United States of America --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
the beginning of the American century.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And of course, into the vacuum

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
where the too-old European powers used to be

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
were played the two bloody catastrophes

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
of the last century --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
we live at one of those times.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And the first of these, the first two of these,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
is about a shift in power.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And what is happening today

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
is, in one sense, frightening

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
because it's never happened before.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
We have seen lateral shifts of power --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the power of Greece passed to Rome

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and the power shifts that occurred

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
during the European civilizations --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
but we are seeing something slightly different.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
For power is not just moving laterally

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
from nation to nation.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
It's also moving vertically.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
What's happening today is that the power that was encased,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
held to accountability, held to the rule of law,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
within the institution of the nation state

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
The globalization of power --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
we talk about the globalization of markets,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
but actually it's the globalization of real power.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And where, at the nation state level

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that power is held to accountability

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
subject to the rule of law,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
on the international stage it is not.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
the power of the money changers --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
this vast money-go-round

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
the money changers, if you like,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the financial speculators

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the power of the multinational corporations

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
now developing budgets

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
often bigger than medium-sized countries.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
These live in a global space

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
which is largely unregulated,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
not subject to the rule of law,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and in which people may act free of constraint.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Now that suits the powerful

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
up to a moment.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's always suitable for those who have the most power

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
to operate in spaces without constraint,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
unregulated space --

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
space not subject to the rule of law --

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
international trade, the Internet, etc. --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
but also by the things you don't want --

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
international criminality, international terrorism.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
The revelation of 9/11

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.260
is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
nevertheless,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
those who inhabit that space can attack you

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
even in your most iconic of cities

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
one bright September morning.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
It's said that something like 60 percent

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
which 9/11 destroyed.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
You see, our enemies also use this space --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to be able to get around their poison,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
which is about destroying our systems and our ways.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Sooner or later,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
sooner or later,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
the rule of history

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
is that where power goes

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
governance must follow.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that one of the phenomenon of our time

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
is the globalization of power,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
then it follows that one of the challenges of our time

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
is to bring governance to the global space.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
to bring governance to the global space.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
I'm not talking about setting up

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
some global democratic institution.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
is that this is unlikely to be done

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
by spawning more U.N. institutions.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
The world needs an international forum.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
But when it comes to governance of the global space,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
my guess is this won't happen

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
through the creation of more U.N. institutions.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and making treaty-based systems,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
treaty-based agreements,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
to govern that global space.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
entirely treaty-based,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to account if necessary.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
a treaty-based organization.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
The G20:

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
we know now that we have to put together an institution

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
which is capable of bringing governance

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to that financial space for financial speculation.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Now there's a problem there,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and we'll come back to it in a minute,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
which is that if you bring the most powerful together

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to fill that governance space,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
then what happens to the weak who are left out?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And that's a big problem,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and we'll return to it in just a second.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
So there's my first message,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that if you are to pass through these turbulent times

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
more or less turbulently,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
then our success in doing that

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
will in large measure depend on our capacity

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to bring sensible governance

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
to the global space.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And watch that beginning to happen.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
My second point is,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
about such a thing,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
but power is not just shifting vertically,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
it's also shifting horizontally.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
has been civilizations gathered around seas --

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
with the first ones around the Mediterranean,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.260
the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Well it seems to me

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Now that begins with economic power,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
but that's the way it always begins.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the augmentation of military budgets

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
occurring in the other growing powers in the world.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
I think actually

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
something different is happening.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
My guess is, for what it's worth,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
is that the United States will remain

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
the most powerful nation on earth

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
for the next 10 years, 15,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
but the context in which she holds her power

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
has now radically altered; it has radically changed.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
We are coming out of 50 years,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
most unusual years, of history

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
in which every compass needle

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
for or against

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
has to be referenced by its position to Washington --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
a world bestrode by a single colossus.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
But that's not a usual case in history.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
In fact, what's now emerging

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
is the much more normal case of history.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
You're beginning to see the emergence

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
of a multi-polar world.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Up until now,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
They will remain the most powerful nation,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
but they will be the most powerful nation

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
in an increasingly multi-polar world.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in China, of course,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
It's going to be quite grumpy

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
as China begins to democratize her society

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
after liberalizing her economy.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
But that's a subject of a different discussion.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
You see India, you see Brazil.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
You see increasingly

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
much more like Europe in the 19th century.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Europe in the 19th century:

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Britain always played to the balance.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
If Paris got together with Berlin,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Now notice,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
you have fixed alliances --

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
NATO, the Warsaw Pact.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
A fixed polarity of power

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
means fixed alliances.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
But a multiple polarity of power

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
means shifting and changing alliances.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
And that's the world we're coming into,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
in which we will increasingly see

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that our alliances are not fixed.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
"Britain has a common interest,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
but no common allies."

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And we will see increasingly

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
that even we in the West

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
will reach out, have to reach out,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to make alliances with others

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
if we want to get things done in the world.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Note, that when we went into Libya,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
we had to bring others in.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
when the West has tried to do it themselves,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and we haven't succeeded.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
My guess

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
of the hegemony of Western power,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Western institutions and Western values.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
it could propose and dispose

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
in every corner of the world.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
But that's no longer true.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
Take the last financial crisis

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
after the Second World War.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
The West got together --

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
the problem solved.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Now we have to call in others.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Now we have to create the G20.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
of our Western friends.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Let me make a prediction for you,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
which is probably even more startling.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
I suspect we are now reaching the end

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
of 400 years

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
when Western power was enough.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
they'll never get themselves involved

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Oh yes? Why not?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
How many Chinese troops

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
serving under the U.N. command in the world today?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
3,700.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
How many Americans? 11.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
What is the largest naval contingent

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
tackling the issue of Somali pirates?

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
The Chinese naval contingent.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
They want to keep the sea lanes open.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
with people with whom we do not share values,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It's a whole new different way

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
of looking at the world that is now emerging.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And here's the third factor,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
which is totally different.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Today in our modern world,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
because of the Internet,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.260
everything is connected to everything.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
We are now interdependent.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
We are now interlocked,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
as nations, as individuals,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
in a way which has never been the case before,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
never been the case before.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
The interrelationship of nations,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
well it's always existed.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
But now we are intimately locked together.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
You get swine flu in Mexico,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
24 hours later.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
There are fires in the steppes of Russia,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
food riots in Africa.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And what that means

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
is the idea of a nation state acting alone,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
not connected with others,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
not working with others,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
is no longer a viable proposition.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Because the actions of a nation state

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
are neither confined to itself,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
to control its own territory,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
because the effects outside the nation state

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
I was a young soldier

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.260
in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
At that time, the defense of my country

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
was about one thing and one thing only:

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Now the enemy is inside the walls.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
I have to speak to the Minister of Health

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
because food security is a threat to my security,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.260
I have to speak to the Minister of Industry

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
is now a point of attack for our enemies --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
as we see from cyber warfare --

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
because who has entered my country,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
who lives in that terraced house in that inner city

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
has a direct effect on what happens in my country --

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.260
as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
It's no longer the case that the security of a country

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
And this tells you something very important.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
It tells you that, in fact,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
our governments, vertically constructed,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
command structures --

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
have got the wrong structures completely.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
You in business know

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
is the network.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
It's your capacity to network that matters,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
both within your governments and externally.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
So here is Ashdown's third law.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
because I haven't invented those yet;

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
where everything is connected to everything,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
the most important thing about what you can do

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
is what you can do with others.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
The most important bit about your structure --

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
whether you're a business --

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
is your docking points, your interconnectors,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
your capacity to network with others.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
You understand that in industry;

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
governments don't.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
But now one final thing.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
that we are now locked together

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
in a way that has never been quite the same before,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.260
then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
Suddenly and for the very first time,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
collective defense, the thing that has dominated us

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
as the concept of securing our nations,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
is no longer enough.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
It used to be the case

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
It is no longer the case.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
The advent of the interconnectedness

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and of the weapons of mass destruction

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
means that, increasingly,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
I share a destiny with my enemy.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
When I was a diplomat

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
in Geneva in the 1970s,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
we succeeded because we understood

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
we shared a destiny with them.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Collective security is not enough.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
Peace has come to Northern Ireland

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
They shared a destiny with their enemies.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
do not understand

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
that they share a collective destiny.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
what has been the proposition

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
of visionaries and poets down the ages

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
becomes something we have to take seriously

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
as a matter of public policy.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
The great poem of John Donne's.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.260
"Send not for whom the bell tolls."

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
And it goes:

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
"Every man's death affected me,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
for I am involved in mankind,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
send not to ask

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
for whom the bell tolls,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
it tolls for thee."

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
For us, I think,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
part of the equation for our survival.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
(Applause)
