00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:17.514
I'd like to take you on the epic quest
of the Rosetta spacecraft.

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:21.540
To escort and land the probe on a comet,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.730
this has been my passion
for the past two years.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.545
In order to do that,

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:30.015
I need to explain to you something
about the origin of the solar system.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:32.238
When we go back
four and a half billion years,

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:33.957
there was a cloud of gas and dust.

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:38.484
In the center of this cloud,
our sun formed and ignited.

00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:44.195
Along with that, what we now know
as planets, comets and asteroids formed.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:47.608
What then happened, according to theory,

00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:51.625
is that when the Earth had cooled down
a bit after its formation,

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:56.396
comets massively impacted the Earth
and delivered water to Earth.

00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:01.516
They probably also delivered
complex organic material to Earth,

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:04.906
and that may have bootstrapped
the emergence of life.

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:08.366
You can compare this to having
to solve a 250-piece puzzle

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.570
and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.053
Afterwards, the big planets
like Jupiter and Saturn,

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:17.631
they were not in their place
where they are now,

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.278
and they interacted gravitationally,

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:23.830
and they swept the whole interior
of the solar system clean,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.432
and what we now know as comets

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:27.545
ended up in something
called the Kuiper Belt,

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:31.213
which is a belt of objects
beyond the orbit of Neptune.

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:34.906
And sometimes these objects
run into each other,

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.971
and they gravitationally deflect,

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.428
and then the gravity of Jupiter
pulls them back into the solar system.

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:46.120
And they then become the comets
as we see them in the sky.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.394
The important thing here to note
is that in the meantime,

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:51.693
the four and a half billion years,

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:54.875
these comets have been sitting
on the outside of the solar system,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.290
and haven't changed --

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.193
deep, frozen versions of our solar system.

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:01.282
In the sky, they look like this.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:03.233
We know them for their tails.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:04.904
There are actually two tails.

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:08.759
One is a dust tail,
which is blown away by the solar wind.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.404
The other one is an ion tail,
which is charged particles,

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.143
and they follow the magnetic field
in the solar system.

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:16.292
There's the coma,

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:19.199
and then there is the nucleus,
which here is too small to see,

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.689
and you have to remember
that in the case of Rosetta,

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.866
the spacecraft is in that center pixel.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.976
We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers
away from the comet.

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:30.297
So what's important to remember?

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:35.166
Comets contain the original material
from which our solar system was formed,

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.526
so they're ideal to study the components

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:41.791
that were present at the time 
when Earth, and life, started.

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.673
Comets are also suspected

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:47.944
of having brought the elements
which may have bootstrapped life.

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:52.309
In 1983, ESA set up
its long-term Horizon 2000 program,

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.233
which contained one cornerstone,
which would be a mission to a comet.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:03:01.123
In parallel, a small mission to a comet,
what you see here, Giotto, was launched,

00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:07.329
and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley
with an armada of other spacecraft.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.900
From the results of that mission,
it became immediately clear

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.087
that comets were ideal bodies to study
to understand our solar system.

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:20.599
And thus, the Rosetta mission
was approved in 1993,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.234
and originally it was supposed
to be launched in 2003,

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:26.858
but a problem arose
with an Ariane rocket.

00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:29.923
However, our P.R. department,
in its enthusiasm,

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:32.145
had already made
1,000 Delft Blue plates

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.535
with the name of the wrong comets.

00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:38.102
So I've never had to buy any china since.
That's the positive part.

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:39.821
(Laughter)

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.701
Once the whole problem was solved,

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:44.882
we left Earth in 2004

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:47.970
to the newly selected comet,
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.826
This comet had to be specially selected

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.480
because A, you have to
be able to get to it,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.261
and B, it shouldn't have been
in the solar system too long.

00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:00.208
This particular comet has been 
in the solar system since 1959.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:03.523
That's the first time
when it was deflected by Jupiter,

00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:06.500
and it got close enough
to the sun to start changing.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.151
So it's a very fresh comet.

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:11.502
Rosetta made a few historic firsts.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:14.018
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,

00:04:14.018 --> 00:04:17.640
and to escort it throughout
its whole tour through the solar system --

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.938
closest approach to the sun,
as we will see in August,

00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:23.259
and then away again to the exterior.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.860
It's the first ever landing on a comet.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.552
We actually orbit the comet
using something which is not

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.001
normally done with spacecraft.

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.636
Normally, you look at the sky and you know
where you point and where you are.

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.772
In this case, that's not enough.

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:40.070
We navigated by looking
at landmarks on the comet.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.545
We recognized features --
boulders, craters --

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:46.562
and that's how we know where we are
respective to the comet.

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:51.091
And, of course, it's the first satellite
to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:52.292
on solar cells.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.619
Now, this sounds more heroic
than it actually is,

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.715
because the technology
to use radio isotope thermal generators

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:03.013
wasn't available in Europe at that time,
so there was no choice.

00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:04.590
But these solar arrays are big.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.865
This is one wing, and these are not
specially selected small people.

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:09.699
They're just like you and me.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.090
(Laughter)

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.291
We have two of these wings,
65 square meters.

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.310
Now later on, of course,
when we got to the comet,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.839
you find out that 65 square meters of sail

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.481
close to a body which is outgassing
is not always a very handy choice.

00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.525
Now, how did we get to the comet?

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:34.193
Because we had to go there
for the Rosetta scientific objectives

00:05:34.193 --> 00:05:38.001
very far away -- four times the distance
of the Earth to the sun --

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:42.111
and also at a much higher velocity
than we could achieve with fuel,

00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:46.430
because we'd have to take six times as
much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.840
So what do you do?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.323
You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,

00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:54.690
where you pass by a planet
at very low altitude,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.455
a few thousand kilometers,

00:05:56.455 --> 00:06:01.168
and then you get the velocity
of that planet around the sun for free.

00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:03.211
We did that a few times.

00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:05.690
We did Earth, we did Mars,
we did twice Earth again,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.658
and we also flew by two asteroids,
Lutetia and Steins.

00:06:10.318 --> 00:06:14.983
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun
that if the spacecraft got into trouble,

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:18.792
we couldn't actually
save the spacecraft anymore,

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:20.765
so we went into hibernation.

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:24.103
Everything was switched off
except for one clock.

00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:27.614
Here you see in white the trajectory,
and the way this works.

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:30.057
You see that from
the circle where we started,

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:33.873
the white line, actually you get
more and more and more elliptical,

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:36.822
and then finally we approached the comet

00:06:36.822 --> 00:06:41.187
in May 2014, and we had to start
doing the rendezvous maneuvers.

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:45.784
On the way there, we flew by Earth and we
took a few pictures to test our cameras.

00:06:45.784 --> 00:06:47.962
This is the moon rising over Earth,

00:06:47.962 --> 00:06:49.917
and this is what we now call a selfie,

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:53.609
which at that time, by the way,
that word didn't exist. (Laughter)

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:56.580
It's at Mars. It was taken
by the CIVA camera.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.762
That's one of the cameras on the lander,

00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:01.177
and it just looks under the solar arrays,

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:05.450
and you see the planet Mars
and the solar array in the distance.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:11.118
Now, when we got out
of hibernation in January 2014,

00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:12.903
we started arriving at a distance

00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:15.736
of two million kilometers
from the comet in May.

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:19.845
However, the velocity
the spacecraft had was much too fast.

00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:25.906
We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour
faster than the comet, so we had to brake.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.763
We had to do eight maneuvers,

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:30.340
and you see here,
some of them were really big.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.364
We had to brake the first one
by a few hundred kilometers per hour,

00:07:36.364 --> 00:07:40.674
and actually, the duration of that
was seven hours,

00:07:40.674 --> 00:07:43.622
and it used 218 kilos of fuel,

00:07:43.622 --> 00:07:47.572
and those were seven nerve-wracking 
hours, because in 2007,

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:50.762
there was a leak in the system
of the propulsion of Rosetta,

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.909
and we had to close off a branch,

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:55.487
so the system was actually
operating at a pressure

00:07:55.487 --> 00:07:58.785
which it was never designed
or qualified for.

00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:04.704
Then we got in the vicinity of the comet,
and these were the first pictures we saw.

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:07.277
The true comet rotation period
is 12 and a half hours,

00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:09.366
so this is accelerated,

00:08:09.366 --> 00:08:12.617
but you will understand that
our flight dynamics engineers thought,

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:16.471
this is not going to be
an easy thing to land on.

00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:21.115
We had hoped for some kind
of spud-like thing

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:23.281
where you could easily land.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:26.572
But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:30.310
No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.003
So at that point in time,
it was clearly unavoidable:

00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:36.534
we had to map this body
in all the detail you could get,

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:41.687
because we had to find an area
which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:46.286
Why 500 meters? That's the error
we have on landing the probe.

00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:49.467
So we went through this process,
and we mapped the comet.

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:51.834
We used a technique
called photoclinometry.

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:54.064
You use shadows thrown by the sun.

00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:57.151
What you see here is a rock
sitting on the surface of the comet,

00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.077
and the sun shines from above.

00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:02.236
From the shadow, we, with our brain,

00:09:02.236 --> 00:09:05.880
can immediately determine
roughly what the shape of that rock is.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.922
You can program that in a computer,

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:12.176
you then cover the whole comet,
and you can map the comet.

00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:15.856
For that, we flew special trajectories
starting in August.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:18.765
First, a triangle
of 100 kilometers on a side

00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.428
at 100 kilometers' distance,

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:23.432
and we repeated the whole 
thing at 50 kilometers.

00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:27.079
At that time, we had seen the comet
at all kinds of angles,

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:31.752
and we could use this technique
to map the whole thing.

00:09:31.752 --> 00:09:35.019
Now, this led to a selection
of landing sites.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:39.279
This whole process we had to do,
to go from the mapping of the comet

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.844
to actually finding
the final landing site, was 60 days.

00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:44.230
We didn't have more.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.350
To give you an idea,
the average Mars mission

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.134
takes hundreds of scientists
for years to meet

00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:52.201
about where shall we go?

00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:54.359
We had 60 days, and that was it.

00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:57.402
We finally selected the final landing site

00:09:57.402 --> 00:10:02.455
and the commands were prepared
for Rosetta to launch Philae.

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:06.830
The way this works is that Rosetta
has to be at the right point in space,

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.653
and aiming towards the comet,
because the lander is passive.

00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:13.330
The lander is then pushed out
and moves towards the comet.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.120
Rosetta had to turn around

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.677
to get its cameras to actually look
at Philae while it was departing

00:10:19.677 --> 00:10:22.146
and to be able to communicate with it.

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:26.720
Now, the landing duration
of the whole trajectory was seven hours.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.507
Now do a simple calculation:

00:10:29.507 --> 00:10:33.546
if the velocity of Rosetta is off
by one centimeter per second,

00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:37.888
seven hours is 25,000 seconds.

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:42.253
That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:45.597
So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta

00:10:45.597 --> 00:10:48.104
much better than
one centimeter per second,

00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:52.168
and its location in space
better than 100 meters

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:55.372
at 500 million kilometers from Earth.

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:57.740
That's no mean feat.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.129
Let me quickly take you through
some of the science and the instruments.

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:05.565
I won't bore you with all the details
of all the instruments,

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:07.214
but it's got everything.

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:10.348
We can sniff gas,
we can measure dust particles,

00:11:10.348 --> 00:11:12.600
the shape of them, the composition,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.108
there are magnetometers, everything.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:18.707
This is one of the results from
an instrument which measures gas density

00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:20.565
at the position of Rosetta,

00:11:20.565 --> 00:11:22.794
so it's gas which has left the comet.

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:25.278
The bottom graph
is September of last year.

00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:28.575
There is a long-term variation,
which in itself is not surprising,

00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:30.456
but you see the sharp peaks.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.546
This is a comet day.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:36.656
You can see the effect of the sun
on the evaporation of gas

00:11:36.656 --> 00:11:39.604
and the fact that the comet is rotating.

00:11:39.604 --> 00:11:41.312
So there is one spot, apparently,

00:11:41.312 --> 00:11:43.459
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:46.756
it gets heated in the Sun,
and then cools down on the back side.

00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:50.262
And we can see
the density variations of this.

00:11:50.262 --> 00:11:54.395
These are the gases
and the organic compounds

00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:56.090
that we already have measured.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.878
You will see it's an impressive list,

00:11:57.878 --> 00:12:00.362
and there is much, much,
much more to come,

00:12:00.362 --> 00:12:02.308
because there are more measurements.

00:12:02.308 --> 00:12:05.656
Actually, there is a conference
going on in Houston at the moment

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:08.117
where many of these results are presented.

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:10.448
Also, we measured dust particles.

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:13.250
Now, for you, this will not
look very impressive,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.523
but the scientists were thrilled
when they saw this.

00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:17.940
Two dust particles:

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.934
the right one they call Boris,
and they shot it with tantalum

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:23.048
in order to be able to analyze it.

00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:25.439
Now, we found sodium and magnesium.

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:29.688
What this tells you is this is
the concentration of these two materials

00:12:29.688 --> 00:12:32.404
at the time the solar system was formed,

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:35.771
so we learned things about
which materials were there

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:38.859
when the planet was made.

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:41.577
Of course, one of the important
elements is the imaging.

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:44.943
This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
the OSIRIS camera,

00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:47.938
and this actually was the cover
of Science magazine

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:50.608
on January 23 of this year.

00:12:50.608 --> 00:12:54.046
Nobody had expected
this body to look like this.

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:57.644
Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks
more like the Half Dome in Yosemite

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.151
than anything else.

00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:02.729
We also saw things like this:

00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:07.651
dunes, and what look to be,
on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.

00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:11.575
Now we know these from Mars,
but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,

00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:14.454
so it's a bit difficult to create
a wind-blown shadow.

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:16.439
It may be local outgassing,

00:13:16.439 --> 00:13:18.622
stuff which goes up and comes back.

00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:21.803
We don't know, so there is
a lot to investigate.

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:23.893
Here, you see the same image twice.

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:26.410
On the left-hand side,
you see in the middle a pit.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.627
On the right-hand side,
if you carefully look,

00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:31.858
there are three jets coming out
of the bottom of that pit.

00:13:31.858 --> 00:13:34.155
So this is the activity of the comet.

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:38.172
Apparently, at the bottom of these pits
is where the active regions are,

00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:40.935
and where the material
evaporates into space.

00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:44.545
There is a very intriguing crack
in the neck of the comet.

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.541
You see it on the right-hand side.

00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.237
It's a kilometer long,
and it's two and a half meters wide.

00:13:50.237 --> 00:13:52.483
Some people suggest that actually,

00:13:52.483 --> 00:13:54.551
when we get close to the sun,

00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.409
the comet may split in two,

00:13:56.409 --> 00:13:58.089
and then we'll have to choose,

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:00.341
which comet do we go for?

00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:03.514
The lander -- again, lots of instruments,

00:14:03.514 --> 00:14:08.855
mostly comparable except for the things
which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.

00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:12.732
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
because you want to compare

00:14:12.732 --> 00:14:16.238
what you find in space
with what you find on the comet.

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:18.931
These are called
ground truth measurements.

00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:22.162
These are the landing descent images

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:24.210
that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.436
You see the lander getting further
and further away from Rosetta.

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:32.244
On the top right, you see an image
taken at 60 meters by the lander,

00:14:32.244 --> 00:14:35.100
60 meters above the surface of the comet.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.514
The boulder there is some 10 meters.

00:14:37.514 --> 00:14:42.228
So this is one of the last images we took
before we landed on the comet.

00:14:42.228 --> 00:14:45.786
Here, you see the whole sequence again,
but from a different perspective,

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:49.971
and you see three blown-ups
from the bottom-left to the middle

00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:54.156
of the lander traveling
over the surface of the comet.

00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:58.342
Then, at the top, there is a before
and an after image of the landing.

00:14:58.342 --> 00:15:02.269
The only problem with the after image is,
there is no lander.

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:05.540
But if you carefully look
at the right-hand side of this image,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.569
we saw the lander still there, 
but it had bounced.

00:15:09.569 --> 00:15:11.230
It had departed again.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.317
Now, on a bit of a comical note here

00:15:14.317 --> 00:15:18.937
is that originally Rosetta was designed
to have a lander which would bounce.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.510
That was discarded because
it was way too expensive.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.784
Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.

00:15:23.784 --> 00:15:25.388
(Laughter)

00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:27.895
During the first bounce,
in the magnetometers,

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:31.725
you see here the data from them,
from the three axes, x, y and z.

00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:33.931
Halfway through, you see a red line.

00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:35.765
At that red line, there is a change.

00:15:35.765 --> 00:15:39.690
What happened, apparently,
is during the first bounce,

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:44.416
somewhere, we hit the edge of a crater
with one of the legs of the lander,

00:15:44.416 --> 00:15:47.236
and the rotation velocity
of the lander changed.

00:15:47.236 --> 00:15:49.209
So we've been rather lucky

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:51.485
that we are where we are.

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:55.154
This is one of
the iconic images of Rosetta.

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:59.077
It's a man-made object,
a leg of the lander,

00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:01.028
standing on a comet.

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:06.159
This, for me, is one of the very best
images of space science I have ever seen.

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:11.340
(Applause)

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.191
One of the things we still have to do
is to actually find the lander.

00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:18.887
The blue area here
is where we know it must be.

00:16:18.887 --> 00:16:22.505
We haven't been able to find it yet,
but the search is continuing,

00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:26.270
as are our efforts to start getting
the lander to work again.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.012
We listen every day,

00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:30.570
and we hope that between now
and somewhere in April,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.308
the lander will wake up again.

00:16:32.308 --> 00:16:34.445
The findings of what
we found on the comet:

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:38.251
This thing would float in water.

00:16:38.251 --> 00:16:40.875
It's half the density of water.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.893
So it looks like
a very big rock, but it's not.

00:16:43.893 --> 00:16:47.539
The activity increase we saw
in June, July, August last year

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.930
was a four-fold activity increase.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.673
By the time we will be at the sun,

00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:56.246
there will be 100 kilos
a second leaving this comet:

00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:57.802
gas, dust, whatever.

00:16:57.802 --> 00:17:00.333
That's 100 million kilos a day.

00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:03.978
Then, finally, the landing day.

00:17:03.978 --> 00:17:09.366
I will never forget -- absolute madness,
250 TV crews in Germany.

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:11.385
The BBC was interviewing me,

00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:14.357
and another TV crew
who was following me all day

00:17:14.357 --> 00:17:16.493
were filming me being interviewed,

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:18.931
and it went on like that
for the whole day.

00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:20.742
The Discovery Channel crew

00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:23.064
actually caught me
when leaving the control room,

00:17:23.064 --> 00:17:25.177
and they asked the right question,

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:28.802
and man, I got into tears,
and I still feel this.

00:17:28.802 --> 00:17:30.485
For a month and a half,

00:17:30.485 --> 00:17:33.319
I couldn't think about
landing day without crying,

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:36.034
and I still have the emotion in me.

00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:38.983
With this image of the comet,
I would like to leave you.

00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:41.096
Thank you.

00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:45.975
(Applause)
