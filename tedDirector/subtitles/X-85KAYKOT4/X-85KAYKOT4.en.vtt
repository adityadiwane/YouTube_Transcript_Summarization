00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and why this is an incredibly important,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
long, oily, hot summer,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
But before I talk about the political chemistry,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
This is a photograph from when I visited

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
to watch the Minerals Management Service

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
testing their ability

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
to burn oil spills in ice.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
you see some ice cubes,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And the thing is, is that

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
We're four percent of the world's population;

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And we don't really understand what oil is,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
until you check out its molecules,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
It takes off. It's a big woosh.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
on the geopolitics of oil again.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
It'll just bake your retinas.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
So there it is; the retinas are baking.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It starts of with the very small ones,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
which are one carbon, four hydrogen --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
that's methane -- it just floats off.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And it goes all the way over

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and they have thousands of hydrogens,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
They're very important in oil spills.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Let me tell you a little bit about

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
the chemistry of oil in water.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It spreads out to be really thin,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
so you have a hard time corralling it.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
The next thing that happens

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
is the light ends evaporate,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and some of the toxic things float into the water column

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and kill fish eggs

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
It triples the amount

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of oily, messy goo that you have in the water,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and it makes it very hard to handle.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It also makes it very viscous.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
of emulsified oil,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
It's incredibly hard to clean up.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And every single oil is different when it hits water.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
When the chemistry of the oil and water

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
also hits our politics,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
it's absolutely explosive.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
For the first time, American consumers

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They have a "eureka!" moment,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
because it's really crucial to understanding

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
"Wow! I'm going to go buy

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and drive happily to work."

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
They set the prices, and I don't even know.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I am helpless over this."

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to diffuse that anger.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
are designed to look like ATMs.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
(Laughter)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
That shows you how bad it is.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
comes in because most Americans actually feel

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And the thing is, too,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
which is somewhat reasonable,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
because in fact, we have designed this system

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
where, if you want to get a job,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
it's much more important to have a car that runs,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And that's actually very perverse.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
This is BP's gas station

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
in downtown Los Angeles.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
work on people so smart?"

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
We don't want to be buying oil;

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
we want to be doing something green.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
And we get kind of in on our own con.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
I mean -- and this is funny,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
it looks funny here.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
which is we don't talk about

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
reducing the amount of oil that we use.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And so, cognitive dissonance

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Okay, so the politics of oil

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
are very moral in the United States.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
of engineering and finance

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and everything else,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
but we actually see it in very moral terms.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Early journalists looked at these spills,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and they said, "This is a filthy industry."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But they also saw in it

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
that people were getting rich for doing nothing.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
long before it became funny.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And the thing about John D. is that

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
he went into this chaotic wild-east

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
of oil industry,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and he rationalized it

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And it also the kind of root

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
of how we see oil as a conspiracy.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
But what's really amazing is that

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Ida Tarbell, the journalist,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and actually got the whole antitrust laws

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
put in place.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
But in many ways,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And here's one of the things

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
that Ida Tarbell said --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
There were no lips.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
with creases running from them."

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
(Laughter)

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
(Laughter)

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And then there's this guy, okay.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So, you might be wondering why it is that,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
we call these CEOs down to Washington,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And this is something that we've been doing since 1974,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
into these CEOs.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And we take it as, you know --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
we look at it on a moral level,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I'm just saying that, when you focus on

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
you don't actually get around to the point

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
or you're going to get around

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
to really reducing the amount of oil

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and reducing our dependence on oil.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
But it makes for good theater,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So the thing about water oil spills

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
is that they are very politically galvanizing.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
You have these pictures of birds.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
They really influence people.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
It started Earth Day.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and understand what happens to us.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Here we are normally;

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We look at these pictures

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
We connect the dots in the supply chain.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And we have this kind of --

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
This is why these moments of these oil spills

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
are so important.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
by the theater or the morals of it.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
We actually need to go in

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and work on the roots of the problem.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
about what happened.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
And so what we did was, actually,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
We stopped drilling in ANWR,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
In fact, it's continued to increase.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
is much higher prices.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
As you can see, our own production has fallen off

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
One of the things that's happened because of this

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
is that, since 1969,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
has had thousands of oil spills a year.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
when we import oil from places

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
without tight environmental regulations.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
every year since 1969.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And we can wrap our heads around the spills,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
because that's what we see here,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
in this area twice the size of Maryland,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and it's all related to the oil.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
they might be actually here in this room.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
who pay a price for us.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
The other thing that we've done,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
as we've continued to increase demand,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
One of the places we put in a big oil project

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
in Chad, with Exxon.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
I was there in 2003.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
We were driving along this dark, dark road,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and the guy in the green stepped out,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and we realized it was okay.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
But at the same time,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Chad has become much more unstable,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
and we are not paying for that price at the pump.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
We do the same thing

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
with the price of policing the Persian Gulf

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
and keeping the shipping lanes open.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
This is 1988 --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that we do not pay for at the pump.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
We pay for it on April 15th,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and our increased consumption

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
is the Gulf of Mexico,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
which was not part of the moratoriums.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
this is the Minerals Management diagram

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
of wells for gas and oil.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
It's become this intense industrialized zone.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
It doesn't have the same resonance for us

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
half of it is actually being refined along the coast,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
because the Gulf actually has

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
about 50 percent of our refining capacity

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and a lot of our marine terminals as well.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
through a less-clean environment.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And finally, American families also pay a price for oil.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
when you consider the actual cost of the oil,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
but on the other hand,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
the fact that people have no other transit options

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
means that they pay a large amount of their income

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
into just getting back and forth to work,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
generally in a fairly crummy car.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
they might have three jobs or more,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and then they have to really commute.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
than they are on taxes or on health care.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And the same thing happens

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
on the American economy,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
but they're also a drain on individual families

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
what do we have to do this time?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
We need to stay away from the moratoriums.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
We need to focus really back again

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
on the molecules.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
on the molecules on the oil.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
One of the things that we also need to do,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
into thinking that you can have a green world,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
We need to focus on reducing the oil.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and the un-useful stuff,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
which is called the rejected energy -- the waste,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
goes up to the top.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
the actually useful amount.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And one of the things that we need to do

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and make them much more efficient,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
but we also need to fix the economy in general.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
For example, we have an insurance system

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
We actually encourage people to drive more.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
We need to have more mobility choices.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
We need to make the gas price

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
better reflect the real cost of oil.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
which is at least 10 billion dollars a year,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and also kind of building markets

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
for new cars and new fuels down the road,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
this is where we need to be.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and you can find more about this policy.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Reducing Oil Needs Gradually,"

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
They're up at NewAmerica.net.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
What's important about these

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
is that we try to move

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
from feeling helpless at the pump,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
to actually being active

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
and to really sort of thinking about who we are,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
having kind of that special moment,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
where we connect the dots actually at the pump.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
Now supposedly, oil taxes

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
is probably too much,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
but I think that if we started this year

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
with three cents a gallon on gasoline,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and at the same time we would give people time to prepare,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
time to respond,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
The first thing that you have on the tax is --

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
So you're not helpless at the pump.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
very similar to what you would find

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
on a cigarette pack.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
creates 29 cents in health care costs."

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
That's a lot.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
than the health care costs on the tax.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
And also, the hope is that

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
you start to be connected to the whole greater system.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
to get more information on commuting,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260
or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
or whatever it is you're going to need

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
With this whole sort of suite of policies,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption --

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
or our oil consumption --

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
by 20 percent by 2020.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
So, three million barrels a day.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
But in order to do this,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
we are people of the hydrocarbon.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
We need to keep or minds on the molecules

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
and not get distracted by the theater,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
of the green possibilities that are out there.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Thank you.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
(Applause)
