00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
In October 2010,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Icons like Batman,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Jami and their colleagues.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
It's a story of intercultural intersections,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and what better group

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to have this conversation

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
than those that grew out of fighting fascism

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
in their respective histories and geographies?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
an unlikely reaction came out of North America.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
As Christian iconography got changed,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
in the United States and Canada,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
also going back to the Bible.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Consider this:

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
like the prophets, all the superheroes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
are missing parents.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Superman's parents die on Krypton

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
before the age of one.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Spiderman is raised

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
by his aunt and uncle.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
from God through Gabriel,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
get their message from above.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
when the spider descends from above

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and gives him his message through a bite.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
when a big bat flies over his head,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Superman is not only sent to Earth

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
from the heavens, or Krypton,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
(Laughter)

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
(Applause)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
These are clearly biblical archetypes,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and the thinking behind that was to create

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
positive, globally-resonating storylines

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that could be tied to the same things

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that other people were pulling mean messages out of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
just becomes a bad man with a bad message.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And it's only by linking positive things

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
that the negative can be delinked.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
This is the kind of thinking that went into

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
creating The 99.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
It doesn't matter what your religion is;

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
"Make sure you lie three times a day."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Those are basic human values.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And so the backstory of The 99

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
takes place in 1258,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and the Tigris changes color with ink.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It's a story passed on generation after generation.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I rewrote that story,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and here's a side note:

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
(Laughter)

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
(Applause)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
So the librarians find out

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
that when mixed with 99 stones

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
But the Mongols get there first.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that we all think is lost to civilization.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
of 33 stones each

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
But in 1492, two important things happen.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
The first is the fall of Granada,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
the last Muslim enclave in Europe.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
(Laughter)

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
So 33 of the stones are smuggled

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and are spread in the New World.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
from 99 different countries.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Now it's very easy to assume

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and I will pay them its weight in gold."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
After a while, his advisers complained.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
is worth a lot more than what we're paying them."

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
is not new to my neck of the desert.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Noor is Arabic for light.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Number two, all of The 99,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
they use it for self-interest.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
you get taken advantage of

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
by people who will exploit your powers, okay.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
a mechanism that self-updates.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Some believe that means that the original interpretation

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I don't belong there.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Now the main bad guy, Rughal,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
does not want these stones to update,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
so he's trying to get them to stop updating.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And he controls them from the top down --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
they actually, each one has a different, colorful

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
kind of dress.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
So The 99 work in teams of three.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Why three? A couple of reasons.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
I think that's there in all cultures, right?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
There's this very strong social message

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that needs to get to kind of

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
the deepest crevices of intolerance,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And so this is the way I dealt with it.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
three boys, three girls, no problem.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Well ...

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
so you -- (Laughter)

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So here's some of the characters that we have.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
but when she first gets her power,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
she starts going on game shows and making money.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and there's also the kind, the generous.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Laughter)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
He's the technology wiz.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Musawwira from Ghana,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Al-Batina is the hidden.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
She said, "That's not me."

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
(Laughter)

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
So from day one, the people involved in the project,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Next to him is Dan Panosian,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And we entered Western consciousness

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
back in 2005.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Didn't have a product, but had energy.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And I found somebody from The New York Times,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and I cornered him, and I pitched him.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And I think I scared him -- (Laughter)

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
because he basically promised me --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
if you'll just go away."

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
(Laughter)

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Like I care, right?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
"So when's the article coming out?"

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
That's not timely.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
So a few days after that, what happens?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
I became timely.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
(Laughter)

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
January 22nd, 2006,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
which changed our lives forever,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
guess what they got; they got me.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And The 99 were like superheroes

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And that led to all kinds of things,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
from being in curricula in universities and schools to --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
it was a couple of men with long beards

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
and they found me to sign the picture.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Laughter)

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
We've been able to license The 99 comic books

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
into eight languages so far --

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
called The 99 Village Theme Park --

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
which is done for global audiences:

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
there is a struggle.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and Noora, the one that can use light,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
because they're being manipulated.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
They don't know, OK,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
So there's a struggle within the team.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
So if we can get the lights ...

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
["The 99"]

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I need more light.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
What's happening?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Dana: There's too much darkness.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Rughal: There must be something we can do.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Man: I won't send any more commandos in

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
until I know it's safe.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Miklos: Must download file contents.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I can't forget auntie.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Dana: But I can't help.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Jabbar: You can,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
even if you don't believe in yourself right now.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I believe in you.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
You are Noora the Light.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Dana: No.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us?

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Now, tell me which way to go.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Dana: That way.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Alarm: Threat imminent.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Jabbar: Aaaahhh!

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
Miklos: Stay away from me.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Jabbar: We're here to help you.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Miklos: No. He gave me access,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
["The 99"]

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Thank you.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Applause)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
it's design.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
But that's only half the story.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
As the father of five sons,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
I see religion being manipulated.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
As a psychologist, I worry

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
for the world in general,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
but worry about the perception of how people see themselves

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
in my part of the world.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and I heard one too many stories of people growing up

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
to idolize their leadership,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
only to end up being tortured by their heroes.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
that just breaks you in so many ways.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Now, one of the things that I refer to

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
when I -- about the importance of this message --

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and one from New York magazine.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Any boys and girls caught flirting

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
would get married off immediately, okay.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
The second one was about a woman complaining

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and started interrogating her on the spot

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
for talking to a man who wasn't related to her.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
The second one, they were actually split

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
between Saudi and Afghanistan.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
it was the party of a Hindu God.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
The second one took place in upstate New York.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It was an Orthodox Jewish community.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
is that in those two interviews,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
the people around, who were interviewed as well,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
refer to that behavior as Talibanization.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and this is dangerous.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
as extreme.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
This is one of my sons, Rayan,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
who's a Scooby Doo addict.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
You can tell by the glasses there.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
(Laughter)

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
Last summer when we were in our home in New York,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And what Rayan did then

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
I want you to come with me to my office in my house.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
I have work to do."

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
(Laughter)

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
(Applause)

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Rayan reframed the situation

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and brought himself down to my level.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
(Laughter)

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
You know, I think that there's a big parallel

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
between bending the crucifix out of shape

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and creating swastikas.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
who think it's cute to have a little child

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
to protest something,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
the hope is by linking enough positive things

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
to the Koran,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
that one day we can move this child

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
from being proud in the way they're proud there,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
to that.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
And I think --

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
I think The 99

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
can and will achieve its mission.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
And people came up and picked up

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
the culturally resonant image of the falafel,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
ate it and, you know, talked and left.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
(Laughter)

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Or so we thought,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
until a woman came rushing across the campus

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
"Who's falafel?"

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
(Laughter)

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
True story.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
(Laughter)

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
(Laughter)

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Just today, D.C. Comics announced

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
the cover of our upcoming crossover.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
On that cover you see Batman, Superman

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
with our Saudi member of The 99,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
our Emirati member and our Libyan member.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
On April 26, 2010,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
President Barack Obama said that

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
in which he reached out to the Muslim world --

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
to the Justice League of America.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
and where religion can be twisted

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
In a world like that,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:14.260
(Applause)
