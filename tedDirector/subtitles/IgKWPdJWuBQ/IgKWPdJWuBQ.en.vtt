Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:20.902
would persuade you to think of trying

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:24.260
to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.662
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:29.814
I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:32.886
to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:36.378
I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:38.737
and sustainable energy production.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.782
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:43.281
is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.486
independent of environmental concerns.

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:48.403
In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:51.483
given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,

00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:55.538
we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:59.548
CA: Most of American electricity comes from

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.210
burning fossil fuels.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.825
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:08.784
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:11.744
One is that, even if you take the same source fuel

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:13.733
and produce power at the power plant

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.627
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:18.606
So if you take, say, natural gas,

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:21.214
which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:24.212
if you burn that in a modern

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:26.407
General Electric natural gas turbine,

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:28.245
you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:30.956
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.856
you get about 20 percent efficiency.

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:34.436
And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:36.804
you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:38.519
is voluminous,

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:39.973
and you can take the waste heat

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:41.342
and run a steam turbine and generate

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:43.126
a secondary power source.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:46.912
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,

00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:50.316
even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:52.788
charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:54.899
CA: That scale delivers efficiency.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.638
EM: Yes, it does.

00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:59.656
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:02.059
of power generation anyway, electricity generation.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.128
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:08.593
then it makes sense for us to have electric cars

00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:11.168
as the mode of transport.

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.603
CA: So we've got some video here

00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:15.094
of the Tesla being assembled,

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.808
which, if we could play that first video --

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:22.752
So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:26.328
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:28.398
and I should say that I think, actually,

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.856
all modes of transport will become fully electric

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:35.923
with the ironic exception of rockets.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.680
There's just no way around Newton's third law.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.132
The question is how do you accelerate

00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:43.712
the advent of electric transport?

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.160
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.487
a really energy efficient car,

00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:50.344
so that means making it incredibly light,

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:51.370
and so what you're seeing here

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.116
is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.702
made in North America.

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:58.390
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.007
to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.167
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.535
of any car of its size.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:09.200
So as a result, the energy usage is very low,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.416
and it has the most advanced battery pack,

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:14.000
and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.939
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.528
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:23.799
but you think the math can still work out intelligently --

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.935
by combining light body, heavy battery,

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:28.208
you can still gain spectacular efficiency.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.040
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.801
to offset the mass of the pack,

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.830
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.555
And in fact, customers of the Model S

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:39.634
are sort of competing with each other

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:42.653
to try to get the highest possible range.

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.183
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:49.271
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.861
broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:53.473
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:56.287
to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed

00:03:56.287 --> 00:04:00.199
and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.089
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.727
if you drive it 65 miles an hour,

00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:08.691
under normal conditions,

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.575
250 miles is a reasonable number.

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:11.713
CA: Let's show that second video

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:14.559
showing the Tesla in action on ice.

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.227
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:19.642
What is the most surprising thing about the experience

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.150
of driving the car?

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.628
EM: In creating an electric car,

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:25.026
the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:27.713
So we wanted really to have people feel as though

00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:29.816
they've almost got to mind meld with the car,

00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:32.990
so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.036
and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,

00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:38.870
like the car has ESP.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.366
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:43.493
You can't do that with a gasoline car.

00:04:43.493 --> 00:04:45.475
I think that's really a profound difference,

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:48.262
and people only experience that when they have a test drive.

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:52.556
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:56.131
Is there a road map where this becomes

00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:57.710
a mass-market vehicle?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.270
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.542
to have a sort of three-step process,

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:06.308
where version one was an expensive car at low volume,

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:09.373
version two is medium priced and medium volume,

00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:11.662
and then version three would be low price, high volume.

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:13.345
So we're at step two at this point.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:16.295
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:19.294
Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.

00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:21.398
And our third generation car, which should hopefully

00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:23.127
be out in about three or four years

00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:25.782
will be a $30,000 car.

00:05:25.782 --> 00:05:28.264
But whenever you've got really new technology,

00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:30.358
it generally takes about three major versions

00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:33.578
in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.

00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:36.302
And so I think we're making progress in that direction,

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.574
and I feel confident that we'll get there.

00:05:38.574 --> 00:05:40.483
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,

00:05:40.483 --> 00:05:44.231
you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.

00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:48.478
There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:51.318
Do you see that coming, really, truly,

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.571
or just on a few key routes?

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:56.446
EM: There actually are far more charging stations

00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.671
than people realize,

00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:01.030
and at Tesla we developed something

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.238
called a Supercharging technology,

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.550
and we're offering that if you buy a Model S

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.015
for free, forever.

00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:10.670
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.500
We actually have California and Nevada covered,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.774
and we've got the Eastern seaboard

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.026
from Boston to D.C. covered.

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:19.408
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:21.551
from L.A. to New York

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.153
just using the Supercharger network,

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:27.370
which charges at five times the rate of anything else.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.796
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,

00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:34.795
to stop time, of about six or seven.

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:37.025
So if you drive for three hours,

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:38.663
you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,

00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:41.160
because that's normally what people will stop for.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.280
So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.818
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,

00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:47.557
hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.914
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.

00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:54.890
So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.857
Wait for an hour, but the good news is,

00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:58.296
you're helping save the planet,

00:06:58.296 --> 00:07:00.989
and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:02.853
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:06.378
to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:14.106
It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:16.204
and then stop for half an hour

00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:17.569
and then keep going.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.851
That's the natural cadence of a trip.

00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:25.232
CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.

00:07:25.232 --> 00:07:27.874
You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.

00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:30.386
What's unusual about that?

00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:32.746
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:36.386
we have to have sustainable electricity production

00:07:36.386 --> 00:07:38.034
as well as consumption,

00:07:38.034 --> 00:07:41.856
so I'm quite confident that the primary means

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:44.337
of power generation will be solar.

00:07:44.337 --> 00:07:46.672
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:49.906
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:52.798
and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy

00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:55.674
for purposes of human civilization.

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:57.680
What most people know but don't realize they know

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.034
is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:04.274
If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball

00:08:04.274 --> 00:08:06.436
at three degrees Kelvin,

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:10.234
and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.

00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:12.890
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.241
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,

00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:17.505
effectively, thousands of years of sun power

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:19.570
compressed into a small space,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.549
so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,

00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:25.638
and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:29.082
fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?

00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:32.391
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.307
will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.694
(Applause)CA: How?

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:42.267
EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.

00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:45.301
CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.

00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:46.452
What are you doing?

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:49.700
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.242
or you can lease a solar system.

00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:53.232
Most people choose to lease.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.298
And the thing about solar power is that

00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:58.049
it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,

00:08:58.049 --> 00:09:01.274
so once it's installed, it's just there.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:05.775
It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:08.713
So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost

00:09:08.713 --> 00:09:10.688
of that initial installation low,

00:09:10.688 --> 00:09:13.323
and then get the cost of the financing low,

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:16.947
because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:20.363
And we've made huge progress in that direction,

00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:23.931
and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.

00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:26.708
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.924
don't pay so much up front.

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:31.604
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.243
We will install panels on your roof.

00:09:34.243 --> 00:09:37.844
You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:41.088
EM: Typical leases are 20 years,

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:45.751
but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.901
It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.

00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:51.781
Pretty good deal.

00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:53.694
CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:56.149
No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.

00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:58.544
For you, the dream here then is that --

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:03.319
I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:06.501
I mean, how do you, the company, benefit?

00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:10.043
EM: Well, essentially,

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:15.930
SolarCity raises a chunk of capital

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.600
from say, a company or a bank.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.813
Google is one of our big partners here.

00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:24.237
And they have an expected return on that capital.

00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:28.623
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof

00:10:28.623 --> 00:10:32.069
and then charges the homeowner or business owner

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:35.779
a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.292
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.

00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:43.056
You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.

00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:44.731
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to

00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.072
is a giant distributed utility.

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:50.955
I think it's a good thing, because utilities

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.792
have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:55.887
So effectively it's the first time

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:59.152
there's been competition for this monopoly,

00:10:59.152 --> 00:11:02.152
because the utilities have been the only ones

00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:04.799
that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.690
So I think it's actually very empowering

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.327
for homeowners and businesses.

00:11:09.327 --> 00:11:10.685
CA: And you really picture a future

00:11:10.685 --> 00:11:14.604
where a majority of power in America,

00:11:14.604 --> 00:11:19.306
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?

00:11:19.306 --> 00:11:25.104
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,

00:11:25.104 --> 00:11:27.216
and most likely a majority,

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:32.476
and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:35.944
I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?

00:11:35.944 --> 00:11:37.690
EM: More from solar than any other source.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.448
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?

00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:44.848
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.

00:11:44.848 --> 00:11:49.168
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)

00:11:49.168 --> 00:11:51.960
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.763
so in roughly 18 years,

00:11:53.763 --> 00:11:57.320
I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.089
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:01.305
with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:06.082
You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.

00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:08.518
You decided to build a space company.

00:12:08.518 --> 00:12:10.591
Why on Earth would someone do that?

00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:12.771
(Laughter)

00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:15.584
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:17.843
People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy

00:12:17.843 --> 00:12:20.744
who made a small fortune in the space industry?"

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:24.992
Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.

00:12:24.992 --> 00:12:27.538
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out

00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:29.825
the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:32.866
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"

00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:37.928
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:41.110
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.860
We came very close to failure,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.994
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.

00:12:45.994 --> 00:12:52.144
The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,

00:12:52.144 --> 00:12:54.098
and in particular to try to crack a problem

00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:55.682
that I think is vital

00:12:55.682 --> 00:12:57.709
for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:02.593
which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

00:13:02.593 --> 00:13:05.684
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:09.698
So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?

00:13:09.698 --> 00:13:13.077
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?

00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:15.213
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,

00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:16.609
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.594
It was really more from the standpoint of

00:13:18.594 --> 00:13:22.464
what are the things that need to happen in order for

00:13:22.464 --> 00:13:25.284
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?

00:13:25.284 --> 00:13:29.373
And I really think there's a fundamental difference,

00:13:29.373 --> 00:13:30.769
if you sort of look into the future,

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:34.226
between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:37.341
that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,

00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:39.553
and I think that's really exciting,

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:42.724
compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth

00:13:42.724 --> 00:13:45.012
until some eventual extinction event.

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:46.764
CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building

00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:50.108
a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.

00:13:50.108 --> 00:13:52.387
How on Earth have you done that?

00:13:52.387 --> 00:13:55.498
NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?

00:13:55.498 --> 00:13:57.899
EM: Well, we've made significant advances

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:00.662
in the technology of the airframe, the engines,

00:14:00.662 --> 00:14:03.883
the electronics and the launch operation.

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:06.604
There's a long list of innovations

00:14:06.604 --> 00:14:08.772
that we've come up with there

00:14:08.772 --> 00:14:14.447
that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --

00:14:14.447 --> 00:14:17.860
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.475
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.

00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:22.715
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's

00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:25.463
more dangerous to patent than not to patent.

00:14:25.463 --> 00:14:28.159
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:32.628
the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:36.047
CA: That's really, really interesting.

00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:38.676
But the big innovation is still ahead,

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:41.415
and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:43.104
EM: Right, so the big innovation—

00:14:43.104 --> 00:14:47.341
CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.

00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:51.415
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:52.957
they're all expendable.

00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:55.219
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.

00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:57.353
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,

00:14:57.353 --> 00:15:00.279
but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:02.375
and the parts that were reusable

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:07.431
took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.

00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:11.017
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:13.199
Obviously that doesn't work very well for —

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.419
CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:20.750
EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.115
be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site

00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:27.132
and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.

00:15:27.132 --> 00:15:31.815
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:35.023
And so what a lot of people don't realize is,

00:15:35.023 --> 00:15:37.621
the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.

00:15:37.621 --> 00:15:39.325
It's much like on a jet.

00:15:39.325 --> 00:15:42.841
So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.743
of the cost of the rocket.

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.895
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,

00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:49.735
roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight

00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:52.815
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.255
That's why it's so important.

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:56.477
Every mode of transport that we use,

00:15:56.477 --> 00:15:59.407
whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,

00:15:59.407 --> 00:16:01.743
is reusable, but not rockets.

00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:05.031
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:06.498
CA: You asked me the question earlier

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:10.293
of how popular traveling on cruises would be

00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:16.428
if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.

00:16:16.428 --> 00:16:18.623
CA: Definitely more expensive.

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:22.594
So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,

00:16:22.594 --> 00:16:26.767
and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,

00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:30.564
at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.

00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:32.846
You'd like to see a colony on Mars.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:36.398
EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination

00:16:36.398 --> 00:16:39.431
of companies and governments, needs to make progress

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.390
in the direction of making life multi-planetary,

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.022
of establishing a base on another planet,

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:48.367
on Mars -- being the only realistic option --

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:49.749
and then building that base up

00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:52.698
until we're a true multi-planet species.

00:16:52.698 --> 00:16:55.671
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"

00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:59.490
how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.595
How's it going?

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:03.759
EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:06.343
with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,

00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:10.519
where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:13.268
the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.

00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:16.304
And we've had some good tests.

00:17:16.304 --> 00:17:18.365
CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.

00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:20.008
So that's just to give a sense of scale.

00:17:20.008 --> 00:17:21.448
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:25.303
and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)

00:17:25.303 --> 00:17:27.255
CA: All right, let's see that video then,

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.286
because this is actually amazing when you think about it.

00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:34.993
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then --

00:17:34.993 --> 00:17:36.911
EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size

00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:39.537
of a 12-story building.

00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:45.507
(Rocket launch)

00:17:50.358 --> 00:17:54.331
So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,

00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.207
and it's constantly adjusting

00:17:56.207 --> 00:17:59.168
the angle, the pitch 
and yaw of the main engine,

00:17:59.168 --> 00:18:02.799
and maintaining roll 
with cold gas thrusters.

00:18:09.306 --> 00:18:15.619
CA: How cool is that? (Applause)

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:20.293
Elon, how have you done this?

00:18:20.293 --> 00:18:25.607
These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,

00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:28.285
Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,

00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:30.870
they're such ambitious projects at scale.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.334
How on Earth has one person

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:35.809
been able to innovate in this way?

00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:37.646
What is it about you?

00:18:37.646 --> 00:18:43.042
EM: I don't know, actually.

00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:45.282
I don't have a good answer for you.

00:18:45.282 --> 00:18:48.917
I work a lot. I mean, a lot.

00:18:48.917 --> 00:18:51.230
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.794
CA: My theory is that you

00:18:54.794 --> 00:18:58.950
have an ability to think at a system level of design

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.593
that pulls together design, technology and business,

00:19:02.593 --> 00:19:06.069
so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,

00:19:06.069 --> 00:19:08.566
into one package,

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:10.925
synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:15.019
and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident

00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:19.635
in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.

00:19:19.635 --> 00:19:24.514
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.

00:19:24.514 --> 00:19:26.611
I mean, almost no one can do that.

00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:29.883
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?

00:19:29.883 --> 00:19:33.307
Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:35.046
It is truly amazing what you've done.

00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:37.055
EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.

00:19:37.055 --> 00:19:41.865
Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:44.489
It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.

00:19:44.489 --> 00:19:49.227
Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,

00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:52.618
boil things down to their fundamental truths

00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:54.009
and reason up from there,

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.595
as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.809
Through most of our life, we get through life

00:19:58.809 --> 00:19:59.897
by reasoning by analogy,

00:19:59.897 --> 00:20:03.435
which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:04.915
And you have to do that.

00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:09.489
Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.

00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:11.633
But when you want to do something new,

00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:15.365
you have to apply the physics approach.

00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:17.613
Physics is really figuring out how to discover

00:20:17.613 --> 00:20:20.258
new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.

00:20:20.258 --> 00:20:22.161
It's really counterintuitive.

00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:24.682
So I think that's an important thing to do,

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:29.240
and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.361
and solicit it, particularly from friends.

00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:34.827
This may sound like simple advice,

00:20:34.827 --> 00:20:37.249
but hardly anyone does that,

00:20:37.249 --> 00:20:39.601
and it's incredibly helpful.

00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:42.963
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.

00:20:42.963 --> 00:20:44.247
Learn from this man.

00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:47.737
Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:51.147
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.

00:20:51.147 --> 00:20:53.408
Look at that. (Applause)

00:20:53.408 --> 00:20:58.235
Just take a bow. That was fantastic.

00:20:58.235 --> 00:20:59.696
Thank you so much.
