00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
My name is Ryan Lobo,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and I've been involved in the documentary

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
During the process of making these films

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I found myself taking photographs,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I had photographs that told a better story

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
than a sometimes-sensational documentary.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I felt, when I had my photographs,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that I was holding on to something true,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
regardless of agendas or politics.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And over there I experienced

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
other people's suffering, up close and personal,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
As always, I would return to Bangalore,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and often to animated discussions at friend's homes,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
where we would discuss various issues

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
their 14-year-old maid.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I would feel very isolated during these discussions.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
But at the same time, I questioned myself

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And I decided that I had compromised,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
just like my friends in those discussions,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
where we told stories

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
in contexts we made excuses for,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.260
rather than taking responsibility for.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
other substances and a woman.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Laughter)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I basically decided that it was I,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
not the camera or the network,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
or anything that lay outside myself,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
that was the only instrument in storytelling

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
truly worth tuning.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
In my life, when I tried to achieve things

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
like success or recognition, they eluded me.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.260
everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Photography transcended culture, including my own.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and gives voice to people and stories without.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I invite you into three recent stories of mine,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
which are about this way of looking, if you will,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
which I believe exemplify the tenets

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.260
In 2007 I went to Liberia,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
where a group of my friends and I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
on a very legendary and brutal war-lord

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
named General Butt Naked.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
where he once used to torture and murder people,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
including children.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Joshua claims to have personally killed

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
He got his name from fighting stark naked.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
alive on Earth today.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.260
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and enforced his command with great brutality.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
How do you live with yourself

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
if you know you've committed horrific crimes?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And he's on a mission.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
He seeked forgiveness,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and he claims to endeavor to improve

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
the lives of his child-soldiers.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
During this expedition I expected him

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
to be killed outright, and us as well.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
But what I saw opened my eyes

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to an idea of forgiveness

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
which I never thought possible.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
people who had nothing absolved a man

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
who had taken everything from them.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
He begs for forgiveness,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and receives it from the same woman

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
whose brother he murdered.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
was once a child soldier, under the General's command,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
until he disobeyed orders,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and the General shot off both his legs.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
He forgives the General in this image.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
He risked his life as he walked up to people

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
whose families he'd murdered.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And Joshua remains silent

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
as they vented their rage against him.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
with a man, surrounded by various influences,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
desperate to hold on to something true within himself,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.260
in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
I was intensely moved during all this.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
But the question is,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.260
does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
standing trial for his crimes,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.260
to an audience that often includes his victims.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
separation of church and state.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The second story I'm going to tell you about

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
is about a group of very special fighting women

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
with rather unique peace-keeping skills.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
bloodiest civil wars,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
which has left more than 200,000 people dead,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
thousands of women scarred by rape and crime

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
on a spectacular scale.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Liberia is now home

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to an all-woman United Nations contingent

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
of Indian peacekeepers.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
These women, many from small towns in India,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.260
help keep the peace, far away from home and family.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
They use negotiation and tolerance

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
more often than an armed response.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
The commander told me that a woman could gauge

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
a potentially violent situation

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
much better than men.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
This man was very drunk,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and he was very interested in my camera,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
until he noticed the women, who handled him

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.260
(Laughter)

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
This contingent seems to be quite lucky,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and it has not sustained any casualties,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And yes, all of those people killed were male.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Many of the women are married with children,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and they say the hardest part of their deployment

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
was being kept away from their children.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I accompanied these women on their patrols,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and watched as they walked past men,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
she said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
We know how to deal with these fellows,"

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and ignored them.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
In a country ravaged by violence against women,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
to join the police force.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
the most inspiring stories are the ones

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that float just beneath the radar.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.260
I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And one editor told me that she wasn't interested

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.260
in doing what she called "manual labor stories."

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.260
In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And all this against incredible logistical odds,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
like heat and traffic jams.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Something amazing happened during this shoot.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
a large slum, which had caught fire.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
These men were terrified,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
as the mob attacked our vehicle.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But nonetheless, despite the hostility,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.260
firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
But the question that lingered in my mind was,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
what causes people to destroy fire trucks

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
headed to their own homes?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Where does such rage come from?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And how are we responsible for this?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
45 percent of the 14 million people

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
which are chronically overcrowded.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
They lack even the most basic amenities.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And this is something that is common to all our big cities.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
were blazing away and exploding all around us.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
The heat was so intense, that hoses were used

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to cool down firefighters

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.260
fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.260
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
But over here, the heads of the DFS,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
led the firefight with their men.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Something wonderful in a country where

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
manual labor is often looked down upon.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.260
(Applause)

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and my own faith in humanity.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.260
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
to do better because they were so pleased

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
regardless of the context,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
can help magnify these intangibles three ways,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260
in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and also in the storyteller.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And that's the power of storytelling.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and it grows. Thank you.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:14.260
(Applause)
