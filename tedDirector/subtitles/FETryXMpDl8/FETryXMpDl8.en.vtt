00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:15.840
So on my way here,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.542
the passenger next to me and I
had a very interesting conversation

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.585
during my flight.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:26.113
He told me, "It seems like
the United States has run out of jobs,

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:28.481
because they're just making some up:

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:34.743
cat psychologist, dog whisperer,
tornado chaser."

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.560
A couple of seconds later, he asked me,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.812
"So what do you do?"

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:42.505
And I was like, "Peacebuilder?"

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:44.985
(Laughter)

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:51.352
Every day, I work to amplify
the voices of women

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:54.450
and to highlight their experiences

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.509
and their participation in peace
processes and conflict resolution,

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.288
and because of my work,

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:08.464
I recognize that the only way to ensure
the full participation of women globally

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:11.330
is by reclaiming religion.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.394
Now, this matter is vitally
important to me.

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:19.805
As a young Muslim woman,
I am very proud of my faith.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:24.540
It gives me the strength and conviction
to do my work every day.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.299
It's the reason I can be here
in front of you.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.133
But I can't overlook the damage that has
been done in the name of religion,

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:37.661
not just my own, but all
of the world's major faiths.

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:42.165
The misrepresentation and misuse
and manipulation of religious scripture

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.694
has influenced our social
and cultural norms,

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:48.620
our laws, our daily lives,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.474
to a point where we sometimes
don't recognize it.

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:57.490
My parents moved from Libya,
North Africa, to Canada

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.254
in the early 1980s,

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:03.100
and I am the middle child of 11 children.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.431
Yes, 11.

00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:07.589
But growing up, I saw my parents,

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:11.165
both religiously devout
and spiritual people,

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.905
pray and praise God for their blessings,

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:18.664
namely me of course, but among others.
(Laughter)

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:21.822
They were kind and funny and patient,

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:28.161
limitlessly patient, the kind of patience
that having 11 kids forces you to have.

00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:30.181
And they were fair.

00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:34.895
I was never subjected to religion
through a cultural lens.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:36.961
I was treated the same,

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.410
the same was expected of me.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.177
I was never taught that God
judged differently based on gender.

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:50.289
And my parents' understanding of God
as a merciful and beneficial friend

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.143
and provider shaped the way
I looked at the world.

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:58.970
Now, of course, my upbringing
had additional benefits.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.722
Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101.
(Laughter)

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:07.169
To this day, I am asked
where I went to school,

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.652
like, "Did you go to
Kennedy School of Government?"

00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:11.558
and I look at them and I'm like, "No,

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.367
I went to the Murabit School
of International Affairs."

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:20.195
It's extremely exclusive. You would have
to talk to my mom to get in.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.331
Lucky for you, she's here.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.368
But being one of 11 children
and having 10 siblings

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:32.600
teaches you a lot about
power structures and alliances.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.403
It teaches you focus; you have
to talk fast or say less,

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.911
because you will always get cut off.

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.767
It teaches you the importance
of messaging.

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:44.993
You have to ask questions in the right way
to get the answers you know you want,

00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:49.172
and you have to say no
in the right way to keep the peace.

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:53.444
But the most important lesson
I learned growing up

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:56.974
was the importance of being at the table.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:00.805
When my mom's favorite lamp broke,
I had to be there when she was trying

00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:05.334
to find out how and by who,
because I had to defend myself,

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:09.117
because if you're not,
then the finger is pointed at you,

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:11.741
and before you know it,
you will be grounded.

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:15.018
I am not speaking
from experience, of course.

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:21.750
When I was 15 in 2005,
I completed high school and I moved

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.240
from Canada -- Saskatoon --

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.319
to Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.711
a very traditional city.

00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:35.530
Mind you, I had only ever been
to Libya before on vacation,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.906
and as a seven-year-old girl,
it was magic.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:44.898
It was ice cream and trips to the beach
and really excited relatives.

00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:50.470
Turns out it's not the same
as a 15-year-old young lady.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.438
I very quickly became introduced
to the cultural aspect of religion.

00:04:56.438 --> 00:05:00.896
The words "haram" --
meaning religiously prohibited --

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:04.402
and "aib" -- meaning
culturally inappropriate --

00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:07.118
were exchanged carelessly,

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:11.437
as if they meant the same thing
and had the same consequences.

00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:16.174
And I found myself in conversation
after conversation with classmates

00:05:16.174 --> 00:05:19.610
and colleagues, professors,
friends, even relatives,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.393
beginning to question my own role
and my own aspirations.

00:05:24.393 --> 00:05:27.923
And even with the foundation
my parents had provided for me,

00:05:27.923 --> 00:05:32.218
I found myself questioning
the role of women in my faith.

00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:36.397
So at the Murabit School
of International Affairs,

00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:39.137
we go very heavy on the debate,

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:44.632
and rule number one is do your research,
so that's what I did,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.425
and it surprised me how easy it was

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:52.442
to find women in my faith
who were leaders,

00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:55.994
who were innovative, who were strong --

00:05:55.994 --> 00:05:59.360
politically, economically,
even militarily.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.751
Khadija financed the Islamic movement

00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.412
in its infancy.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:07.007
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:10.274
So why weren't we learning about her?

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:13.195
Why weren't we learning about these women?

00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:15.986
Why were women being relegated
to positions which predated

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:18.656
the teachings of our faith?

00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:20.931
And why, if we are equal
in the eyes of God,

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.033
are we not equal in the eyes of men?

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:29.690
To me, it all came back to the lessons
I had learned as a child.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.022
The decision maker, the person
who gets to control the message,

00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:36.604
is sitting at the table,

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:41.504
and unfortunately,
in every single world faith,

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:44.150
they are not women.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.192
Religious institutions
are dominated by men

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:49.143
and driven by male leadership,

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:52.579
and they create policies
in their likeness,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.672
and until we can change
the system entirely,

00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:59.939
then we can't realistically
expect to have full economic

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.515
and political participation of women.

00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:06.626
Our foundation is broken.

00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:12.778
My mom actually says, you can't build
a straight house on a crooked foundation.

00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:21.130
In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out,
and my family was on the front lines.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.644
And there's this amazing thing
that happens in war,

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:27.773
a cultural shift almost, very temporary.

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:30.844
And it was the first time that I felt
it was not only acceptable

00:07:30.844 --> 00:07:33.816
for me to be involved,
but it was encouraged.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:36.161
It was demanded.

00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.170
Myself and other women
had a seat at the table.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.569
We weren't holding hands or a medium.

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:44.427
We were part of decision making.

00:07:44.427 --> 00:07:47.840
We were information sharing.
We were crucial.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.890
And I wanted and needed
for that change to be permanent.

00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:57.128
Turns out, that's not that easy.

00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:01.500
It only took a few weeks before the women
that I had previously worked with

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.470
were returning back
to their previous roles,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.275
and most of them were driven
by words of encouragement

00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:10.177
from religious and political leaders,

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:14.171
most of whom cited religious scripture
as their defense.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:18.000
It's how they gained popular support
for their opinions.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.317
So initially, I focused on the economic
and political empowerment of women.

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:27.823
I thought that would lead
to cultural and social change.

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:32.165
It turns out, it does a little,
but not a lot.

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:36.530
I decided to use
their defense as my offense,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.174
and I began to cite and highlight
Islamic scripture as well.

00:08:41.174 --> 00:08:45.736
In 2012 and 2013, my organization
led the single largest

00:08:45.736 --> 00:08:48.221
and most widespread
campaign in Libya.

00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:52.997
We entered homes and schools
and universities, even mosques.

00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.279
We spoke to 50,000 people directly,

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:59.343
and hundreds of thousands more through
billboards and television commercials,

00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:02.130
radio commercials and posters.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.194
And you're probably wondering how
a women's rights organization

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:08.166
was able to do this in communities
which had previously opposed

00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:11.161
our sheer existence.

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.170
I used scripture.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.560
I used verses from the Quran
and sayings of the Prophet,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.525
Hadiths, his sayings which
are, for example,

00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:26.961
"The best of you is the best
to their family."

00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:30.978
"Do not let your brother oppress another."

00:09:30.978 --> 00:09:35.993
For the first time, Friday sermons
led by local community imams

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:38.478
promoted the rights of women.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:42.076
They discussed taboo issues,
like domestic violence.

00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:45.620
Policies were changed.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.205
In certain communities,
we actually had to go as far

00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:53.106
as saying the International
Human Rights Declaration,

00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:57.192
which you opposed because it wasn't
written by religious scholars,

00:09:57.192 --> 00:10:01.975
well, those same principles
are in our book.

00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:05.746
So really, the United Nations
just copied us.

00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:10.774
By changing the message,
we were able to provide

00:10:10.774 --> 00:10:14.899
an alternative narrative which promoted
the rights of women in Libya.

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:20.201
It's something that has now
been replicated internationally,

00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:24.590
and while I am not saying it's easy --
believe me, it's not.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.421
Liberals will say you're using religion
and call you a bad conservative.

00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:31.904
Conservatives will call you
a lot of colorful things.

00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:35.990
I've heard everything from, "Your parents
must be extremely ashamed of you" --

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.100
false; they're my biggest fans --

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.611
to "You will not make it
to your next birthday" --

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:44.304
again wrong, because I did.

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:46.810
And I remain

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:53.231
a very strong believer that women's rights
and religion are not mutually exclusive.

00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:57.033
But we have to be at the table.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:01.856
We have to stop giving up our position,
because by remaining silent,

00:11:01.856 --> 00:11:07.387
we allow for the continued persecution
and abuse of women worldwide.

00:11:07.837 --> 00:11:10.842
By saying that we're going
to fight for women's rights

00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:14.627
and fight extremism
with bombs and warfare,

00:11:14.627 --> 00:11:18.876
we completely cripple local societies
which need to address these issues

00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:21.105
so that they're sustainable.

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:28.570
It is not easy, challenging
distorted religious messaging.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.770
You will have your fair share
of insults and ridicule and threats.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.216
But we have to do it.

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:40.957
We have no other option than to reclaim
the message of human rights,

00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:43.604
the principles of our faith,

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:46.367
not for us, not for
the women in your families,

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.317
not for the women in this room,

00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:51.491
not even for the women out there,

00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:54.997
but for societies
that would be transformed

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:57.314
with the participation of women.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.391
And the only way we can do that,

00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:02.179
our only option,

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.709
is to be, and remain, at the table.
