00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So this is a story

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
of a place that I now call home.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It's a story of public education

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and of rural communities

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and of what design might do to improve both.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
So this is Bertie County,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
North Carolina, USA.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
To give you an idea of the "where:"

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
It's about two hours east

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
driving-time from Raleigh.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It's mostly farmland.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
The entire county

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
So there's only 27 people per square mile,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
which comes down to about 10 people

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
per square kilometer.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Bertie County is kind of a prime example

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
in the demise of rural America.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
We've seen this story all over the country

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and even in places beyond the American borders.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
We know the symptoms.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
It's the hollowing out of small towns.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
The brain drain --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
It's the dependence on farm subsidies

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and under-performing schools

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and higher poverty rates in rural areas

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
than in urban.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And Bertie County is no exception to this.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
like many communities similar to it,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
is that there's no

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
shared, collective investment

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in the future of rural communities.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
benefits rural communities,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It is the poorest county in the state.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
It has one in three of its children living in poverty,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
The economy is mostly agricultural.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
The county seat is Windsor.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
It's home to only 2,000 people,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and like a lot of other small towns

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
it has been hollowed out over the years.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
than occupied and in use.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
You can count the number of restaurants in the county

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
on one hand --

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
there's no Internet cafe,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
There isn't even a Walmart.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Racially, the county

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
is about 60 percent African-American,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
but what happens in the public schools

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
is most of the privileged white kids

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
go to the private Lawrence Academy.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So the public school students

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
are about 86 percent African-American.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and you can see the difference is pretty stark.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So to say that the public education system

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
in Bertie County is struggling

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
would be a huge understatement.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
There's basically no pool

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
of qualified teachers to pull from,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and only eight percent of the people in the county

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
have a bachelor's degree or higher.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So there isn't a big legacy

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
in the pride of education.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
In fact, two years ago,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
were passing the state standard

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
in both English and math.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
but I promise there is good news.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
The biggest asset, in my opinion,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
fondly known as Dr. Z.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
He was brought in in October 2007

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
as the new superintendent

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
to basically fix this broken school system.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And he previously was a superintendent

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
in Charleston, South Carolina

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and then in Denver, Colorado.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
He started some of the country's first charter schools

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
in the late '80s in the U.S.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and he is the reason that I now live and work there.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So in February of 2009,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to come to Bertie and to partner with him

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
on the repair of this school district

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And he invited us in particular

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because we have a very specific

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
type of design process --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
one that results in appropriate design solutions

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
in places that don't usually have access

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to design services or creative capital.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Specifically, we use these six design directives,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
probably the most important being number two:

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
we design with, not for --

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
it's not about designing for clients anymore.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It's about designing with people,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So at the time of being invited down there,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
we were based in San Francisco,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and so we were going back and forth

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
for basically the rest of 2009,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
spending about half our time in Bertie County.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And when I say we, I mean Project H,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
because he would kill me if he knew I was using it

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
because of the sweatsuits.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But this is our front porch. We live there.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
We now call this place home.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
we realized we had fallen in love with the place.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
We had fallen in love with the place and the people

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and the work that we're able to do

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
in a rural place like Bertie County,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that, as designers and builders,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
you can't do everywhere.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
There's space to experiment

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and to weld and to test things.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
There's a nobility of real, hands-on,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
dirt-under-your-fingernails work.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
there is a huge need.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And so we saw an opportunity

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to bring design as this untouched tool,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and to be sort of the -- to usher that in

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
as a new type of tool in their tool kit.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
The initial goal became using design

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that was why we were there.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
But beyond that, we recognized

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
that Bertie County, as a community,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
was in dire need of a fresh perspective

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
of pride and connectedness

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and of the creative capital

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that they were so much lacking.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
but then to figure out how to make education

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
a great vehicle for community development.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
to the intersection of design and education.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
but I feel pretty confident that they could work

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
in a lot of other rural communities

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So the first of the three is design for education.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
This is the most kind of direct, obvious

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
intersection of the two things.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
It's the physical construction

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
of improved spaces and materials and experiences

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
for teachers and students.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and the outdated textbooks

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So traditionally, the computer labs,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
where they have to benchmark test every other week,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
the computer lab is a kill-and-drill

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
testing facility.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to create a more convivial and social space

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
that was more engaging, more accessible,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and also to increase the ability for teachers

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So this is the lab at the high school,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and the principal there is in love with this room.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
of this educational playground system

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
called the learning landscape.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
through game play and activity

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and running around and screaming and being a kid.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
So this game that the kids are playing here --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
in this case they were learning basic multiplication

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
through a game called Match Me.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
one team on each side of the playground,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and the teacher will take a piece of chalk

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and just write a number on each of the tires.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And then she'll call out a math problem --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
so let's say four times four --

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and then one student from each team has to compete

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
to figure out that four times four is 16

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and then your team wins.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And the impact of the learning landscape

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
has been pretty surprising and amazing.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
a greater comfort level with the material,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
especially with the boys,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
that in going outside and playing,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
they aren't afraid to take on

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
a double-digit multiplication problem --

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and also that the teachers are able

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
to use these as assessment tools

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
to better gauge how their students

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
are understanding new material.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
So with design for education, I think the most important thing

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
He came out for one of our teacher-training days

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
(Laughter)

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
So the second approach is redesigning education itself.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
This is the most complex.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
It's a systems-level look

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
at how education is administered

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and what is being offered and to whom.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So in many cases this is not so much about making change

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
as it is creating the conditions

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
under which change is possible

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and the incentive to want to make change,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
which is easier said than done in rural communities

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
and in inside-the-box education systems

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
in rural communities.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
called Connect Bertie.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And this was for a fund that the school district had

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
in every home

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
with a child in the public school system.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Right now I should say,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
there are only 10 percent of the houses

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
that actually have an in-home Internet connection.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And the only places to get WiFi

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Aside from, you know, getting people excited

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
it asked the school system

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
to envision how it might become a catalyst

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
for a more connected community.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and to think about how they could play a role

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
in the community's development.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
So the first batch of computers

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
are being installed later this summer,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
around how we might connect the classroom and the home

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
to extend learning beyond the school day.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
which is where we are now,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
is: design as education.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So "design as education" means

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that we could actually teach design within public schools,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and not design-based learning --

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
but actually learning design-thinking

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
coupled with real construction and fabrication skills

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
put towards a local community purpose.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
It also means that designers are no longer consultants,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
but we're teachers,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and we are charged with growing creative capital

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
within the next generation.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
And what design offers as an educational framework

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
is an antidote

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that so many of these school districts are plagued by.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
it requires an active engagement,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
in real ways.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So we started thinking

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
about the legacy of shop class

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
historically, has been something

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
It's a vocational training path.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
The projects are things like,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
has gone away entirely.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
but this time orient the projects

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
around things that the community needed,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
and to infuse shop class

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So we took this kind of nebulous idea

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
on writing this as a one-year curriculum

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
offered at the high school level to the junior class.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And so this starts in four weeks,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
at the end of the summer,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and my partner and I, Matthew and I,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And this is what it looks like.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
So over the course of two semesters,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
the Fall and the Spring,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
the students spend three hours a day every single day

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
in our 4,500 square foot

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
studio/shop space.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And during that time, they're doing everything

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
coming back into the studio,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
doing the brainstorming and design visualization

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
to come up with concepts that might work,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
building them, prototyping them,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
They're paid as employees of Project H

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to be the construction crew with us

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
to build these projects in the community.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So the first project, which will be built next summer,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.260
is an open-air farmers' market downtown,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
So these are real visible projects

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
that hopefully the students can point to and say,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
"I built that, and I'm proud of it."

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
So I want you to meet three of our students.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
This is Ryan.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
She is 15 years old.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and she feels very strongly about giving back

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
So what Studio H might offer her

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
is a way to develop skills

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
This is Eric. He plays for the football team.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
He is really into dirtbike racing,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
and he wants to be an architect.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
So for him, Studio H offers him

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
everything from drafting to wood and metal construction

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
to how to do research for a client.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
And then this is Anthony.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and doing anything with his hands,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
and so for him, Studio H means

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
that he can stay interested in his education

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
through that hands-on engagement.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
so if he ends up not going to college,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
What design and building really offers to public education

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
is a different kind of classroom.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
So this building downtown,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is now the classroom.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
about what kind of food they buy

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and from where and why --

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
that's a homework assignment.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
that's the final exam.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And for the community, what design and building offers

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
is real, visible, built progress.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
It's one project per year,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and it makes the youth the biggest asset

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and the biggest untapped resource

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
in imagining a new future.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
is a small story --

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
13 students, it's two teachers,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
it's one project in one place.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
But we feel like this could work in other places.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
because it is so difficult

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
to do humanitarian work at a global scale.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Because, when you zoom out that far,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
you lose the ability to view people as humans.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Ultimately, design itself is a process

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
of constant education

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
for the people that we work with and for

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and for us as designers.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
So while this is a very small story,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
we hope that it represents a step in the right direction

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
for the future of rural communities

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and for the future of public education

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and hopefully also for the future of design.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Thank you.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:37.260
(Applause)
