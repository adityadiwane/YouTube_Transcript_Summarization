00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.849
I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.042
so if I say "killer robots,"

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.403
you'd probably think something like this.

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.958
But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.906
I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:29.028
autonomous combat drones.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.655
Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.915
which have a human making targeting decisions.

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:39.044
I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:41.698
that make lethal decisions about human beings

00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:44.115
all on their own.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:48.115
There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.971
Now, lethally autonomous killer robots

00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.040
would take many forms -- flying, driving,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.786
or just lying in wait.

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:59.895
And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:02.379
These are two automatic sniper stations

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.516
currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:08.687
Both of these machines are capable of automatically

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:12.211
identifying a human target and firing on it,

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:16.535
the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:20.124
Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:22.496
to make that lethal firing decision,

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:27.909
but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.002
And it's that choice that I want to focus on,

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.643
because as we migrate lethal decision-making

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:36.752
from humans to software,

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:40.228
we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:43.754
but also changing our social landscape entirely,

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:45.978
far from the battlefield.

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:50.487
That's because the way humans resolve conflict

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:52.220
shapes our social landscape.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.853
And this has always been the case, throughout history.

00:01:54.853 --> 00:01:57.514
For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems

00:01:57.514 --> 00:01:59.593
in 1400 A.D.

00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:02.737
Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:05.977
but with these you could dominate the populace,

00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:09.866
and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.553
Power was focused at the very top.

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:16.081
And what changed? Technological innovation.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.952
Gunpowder, cannon.

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:21.769
And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.302
and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:28.081
versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.719
And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.399
as a political and logistical requirement of defense.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.775
And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.608
they began to share power.

00:02:39.608 --> 00:02:42.207
Representative government began to form.

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:45.495
So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:48.799
shape our social landscape.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.863
Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,

00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:58.031
except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,

00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:02.871
they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:09.386
possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:11.143
Now, I think, knowing this,

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:15.495
we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.474
to do what humans do best, which is adapt.

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:21.479
But time is a factor.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.330
Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.487
combat drones of their own,

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.080
and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.552
are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:36.319
That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.703
there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:44.303
away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.

00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:49.562
The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.415
For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:58.727
a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:03.226
By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:06.375
outstripping human ability to review it all,

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:10.039
but even that number is about to go up drastically.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.614
The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs

00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:15.778
will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:17.816
on each drone platform,

00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:21.119
and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.279
And that means visual intelligence software will need

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:27.327
to scan it for items of interest.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:28.675
And that means very soon

00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:31.422
drones will tell humans what to look at,

00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:33.919
not the other way around.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.392
But there's a second powerful incentive pushing

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:39.775
decision-making away from humans and onto machines,

00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:42.647
and that's electromagnetic jamming,

00:04:42.647 --> 00:04:44.883
severing the connection between the drone

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.697
and its operator.

00:04:47.697 --> 00:04:50.315
Now we saw an example of this in 2011

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:53.271
when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone

00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:57.578
got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,

00:04:57.578 --> 00:05:02.692
but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:04.744
and that means drones

00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:08.364
will have to shoulder more decision-making.

00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:11.407
They'll know their mission objective,

00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:16.252
and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:18.833
They'll ignore external radio signals

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.163
and send very few of their own.

00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:23.169
Which brings us to, really, the third

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.031
and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:30.373
away from humans and onto weapons:

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:33.666
plausible deniability.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.553
Now we live in a global economy.

00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:40.887
High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.

00:05:40.887 --> 00:05:43.801
Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.687
to parts unknown,

00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:47.701
and in that environment, it is very likely

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:52.435
that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.605
proliferate in the gray market.

00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:57.065
And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.025
of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:04.425
who sent that weapon.

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:07.225
This raises the very real possibility

00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:10.160
of anonymous war.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.774
This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:16.265
make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:19.113
against an attacker, and that could shift the balance

00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:22.877
in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.

00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:26.001
It could make military action a viable option

00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.289
not just for small nations,

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.834
but criminal organizations, private enterprise,

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.313
even powerful individuals.

00:06:33.313 --> 00:06:36.641
It could create a landscape of rival warlords

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:40.321
undermining rule of law and civil society.

00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:43.937
Now if responsibility and transparency

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.321
are two of the cornerstones of representative government,

00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:50.641
autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:52.187
Now you might be thinking that

00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:54.433
citizens of high-tech nations

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:57.136
would have the advantage in any robotic war,

00:06:57.136 --> 00:07:00.769
that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:05.057
particularly against developing nations.

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:08.581
But I think the truth is the exact opposite.

00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:10.832
I think citizens of high-tech societies

00:07:10.832 --> 00:07:14.561
are more vulnerable to robotic weapons,

00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:19.026
and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.

00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:22.507
Data powers high-tech societies.

00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:25.697
Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:29.169
social media, email, text, financial transaction data,

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:32.701
transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data

00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:36.074
on the movements and social interactions of people.

00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:39.849
In short, we are more visible to machines

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:42.091
than any people in history,

00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:47.707
and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.

00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:49.445
What you're looking at here

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:52.691
is a link analysis map of a social group.

00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:56.325
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:59.205
And these types of maps can be automatically generated

00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:03.920
based on the data trail modern people leave behind.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.397
Now it's typically used to market goods and services

00:08:06.397 --> 00:08:10.813
to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,

00:08:10.813 --> 00:08:14.173
because targeting is used in another context.

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:16.733
Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.

00:08:16.733 --> 00:08:20.013
These are the hubs of social networks.

00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:23.603
These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:26.285
and these people also can be automatically identified

00:08:26.285 --> 00:08:28.667
from their communication patterns.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.813
Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them

00:08:30.813 --> 00:08:33.356
with product samples, try to spread your brand

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:36.185
through their social group.

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.138
But if you're a repressive government

00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:42.948
searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,

00:08:42.948 --> 00:08:45.708
eliminate them, disrupt their social group,

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:48.877
and those who remain behind lose social cohesion

00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:51.498
and organization.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.822
Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,

00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:57.457
borders would offer very little protection

00:08:57.457 --> 00:08:59.403
to critics of distant governments

00:08:59.403 --> 00:09:03.049
or trans-national criminal organizations.

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:06.542
Popular movements agitating for change

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:10.151
could be detected early and their leaders eliminated

00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:13.062
before their ideas achieve critical mass.

00:09:13.062 --> 00:09:15.653
And ideas achieving critical mass

00:09:15.653 --> 00:09:19.589
is what political activism in popular government is all about.

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.586
Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:27.368
an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:31.102
And this would put a chill on free speech

00:09:31.102 --> 00:09:36.410
and popular political action, the very heart of democracy.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.324
And this is why we need an international treaty

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:42.864
on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban

00:09:42.864 --> 00:09:46.772
on the development and deployment of killer robots.

00:09:46.772 --> 00:09:50.026
Now we already have international treaties

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:53.412
on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,

00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:55.700
these have largely worked.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.468
But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,

00:09:59.468 --> 00:10:02.756
because they will almost certainly be used,

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:07.783
and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.

00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:11.251
Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense

00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.709
issued a directive requiring

00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:18.228
a human being be present in all lethal decisions.

00:10:18.228 --> 00:10:23.004
This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,

00:10:23.004 --> 00:10:26.757
but that directive needs to be made permanent.

00:10:26.757 --> 00:10:31.133
And it could set the stage for global action.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:34.978
Because we need an international legal framework

00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:37.116
for robotic weapons.

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:40.044
And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:43.196
or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world

00:10:43.196 --> 00:10:45.120
to rush to adopt these weapons

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.891
before thinking through the consequences.

00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:51.872
Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power

00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:58.155
in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.

00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:00.841
Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons

00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:03.459
of great uses for unarmed civilian drones:

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:07.398
environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.

00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:10.224
If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,

00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:13.811
how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones

00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:16.459
and vehicles while still protecting ourselves

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.439
against illegal robotic weapons?

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:25.180
I think the secret will be transparency.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.193
No robot should have an expectation of privacy

00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:31.644
in a public place.

00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:36.692
(Applause)

00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:38.737
Each robot and drone should have

00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:41.620
a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.543
that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.

00:11:44.543 --> 00:11:47.924
We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:49.765
This is no different.

00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:51.777
And every citizen should be able to download an app

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:54.902
that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles

00:11:54.902 --> 00:11:57.331
moving through public spaces around them,

00:11:57.331 --> 00:12:00.064
both right now and historically.

00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:03.612
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones

00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:05.956
to detect rogue drones,

00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:09.132
and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:12.124
they should notify humans to their presence.

00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:14.730
And in certain very high-security areas,

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.639
perhaps civic drones would snare them

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.480
and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.507
But notice, this is more an immune system

00:12:22.507 --> 00:12:23.828
than a weapons system.

00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:26.420
It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.452
of autonomous vehicles and drones

00:12:28.452 --> 00:12:32.747
while still preserving our open, civil society.

00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:35.746
We must ban the deployment and development

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:37.608
of killer robots.

00:12:37.608 --> 00:12:42.458
Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.

00:12:42.458 --> 00:12:45.176
Autocratic governments and criminal organizations

00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:48.132
undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:50.023
Autonomous robotic weapons

00:12:50.023 --> 00:12:52.074
would concentrate too much power

00:12:52.074 --> 00:12:54.556
in too few unseen hands,

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:57.811
and that would be corrosive to representative government.

00:12:57.811 --> 00:13:00.772
Let's make sure, for democracies at least,

00:13:00.772 --> 00:13:03.376
killer robots remain fiction.

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:04.486
Thank you.

00:13:04.486 --> 00:13:09.051
(Applause)

00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:13.667
Thank you. (Applause)
