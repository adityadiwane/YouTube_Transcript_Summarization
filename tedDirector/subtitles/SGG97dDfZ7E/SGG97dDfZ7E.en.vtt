00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:15.504
The FBI is responsible
for more terrorism plots

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:17.175
in the United States

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.771
than any other organization.

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.625
More than al Qaeda,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.010
more than al Shabaab,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560
more than the Islamic State,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.354
more than all of them combined.

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:30.011
This isn't likely how you
think about the FBI.

00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:34.066
You probably think of FBI agents
gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.207
or arresting corrupt politicians.

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:38.858
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,

00:00:38.858 --> 00:00:40.331
the FBI became less concerned 

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.940
with gangsters and 
crooked elected officials.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.402
The new target became terrorists,

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.823
and the pursuit of terrorists 
has consumed the FBI.

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:51.618
Every year, the Bureau spends
3.3 billion dollars

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.222
on domestic counterterrorism activities.

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:57.823
Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars
combined for organized crime,

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.999
financial fraud, public corruption

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.777
and all other types of traditional
criminal activity.

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:04.973
I've spent years pouring through
the case files

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.805
of terrorism prosecutions in 
the United States,

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10.074
and I've come to 
the conclusion that the FBI

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:13.914
is much better at creating terrorists
than it is at catching terrorists.

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.097
In the 14 years since 9/11,

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.681
you can count about six real 
terrorist attacks in the United States.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.751
These include the Boston Marathon 
bombings in 2013,

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.040
as well as failed attacks,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.505
such as the time when 
a man named Faisal Shahzad

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.077
tried to deliver a car bomb
to Times Square.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.122
In those same 14 years,

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:33.754
the Bureau, however, has bragged

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.335
about how it's foiled dozens
of terrorism plots.

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:41.183
In all, the FBI has arrested
more than 175 people

00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:44.629
in aggressive, undercover 
conterterrorism stings.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.467
These operations, which are usually
led by an informant,

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.293
provide the means and opportunity,

00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:51.225
and sometimes even the idea,

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:54.081
for mentally ill and 
economically desperate people

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.291
to become what we now term terrorists.

00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:00.368
After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:

00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:01.586
never again.

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:04.707
Never another attack on American soil.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:07.667
FBI agents were told to find terrorists
before they struck.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:12.507
To do this, agents recruited a network
of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.276
all looking for anyone who 
might be dangerous.

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.647
An informant can earn 
100,000 dollars or more

00:02:17.647 --> 00:02:20.752
for every terrorism case 
they bring to the FBI.

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:24.025
That's right, the FBI is paying
mostly criminals and con men

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.926
six figures to spy on communities
in the United States,

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:30.103
but mostly Muslim American communities.

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:33.277
These informants nab people like 
Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:35.148
and Walli Mujahidh.

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:36.653
Both are mentally ill.

00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:40.016
Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing
gasoline and attempting suicide.

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:42.537
Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.745
he had trouble distinguishing between
reality and fantasy.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:48.227
In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men

00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:52.039
for conspiring to attack a military
recruiting station outside Seattle

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:56.363
with weapons provided, 
of course, by the FBI.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:59.068
The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.027
a convicted rapist and child molester

00:03:01.027 --> 00:03:04.361
who was paid 90,000 dollars 
for his work on the case.

00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.849
This isn't an outlier.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.671
In 2009, an FBI informant
who had fled Pakistan on murder charges

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.995
led four men in a plot to bomb 
synagogues in the Bronx.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:15.526
The lead defendant was James Cromitie,

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:18.476
a broke Walmart employee
with a history of mental problems.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:21.201
And the informant had offered 
him 250,000 dollars

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.587
if he participated in that plot.

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.232
There are many more examples.

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:28.350
Today, The Intercept
published my new story

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.065
about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa
involving Sami Osmakac,

00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:35.218
a young man who was living 
near Tampa, Florida.

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.890
Osmakac also had 
schizoaffective disorder.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.895
He too was broke,

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:41.932
and he had no connections to 
international terrorist groups.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:42.773
Nonetheless,

00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:46.617
an FBI informant gave him a job,
handed him money,

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.438
introduced him to an undercover agent
posing as a terrorist,

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:52.727
and lured him in a plot
to bomb an Irish bar.

00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:54.684
But here's what's interesting:

00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:56.138
The lead undercover agent --

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:58.776
you can see him in this picture
with his face blurred --

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:02.287
would go back to the Tampa field office
with his recording equipment on.

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:03.608
Behind closed doors,

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:06.987
FBI agents admitted that what
they were doing was farcical.

00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:10.216
A federal judge doesn't want you
to hear about these conversations.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.367
He sealed the transcripts and placed
them under a protective order

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:16.784
in an attempt to prevent someone like me
from doing something like this.

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:19.585
Behind closed doors, the lead agent,

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:20.916
the squad supervisor,

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.551
described their would-be terrorist

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:25.182
as a "retarded fool who didn't have
a pot to piss in."

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.009
They described his terrorist ambitions

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.998
as wishy-washy and
a pipe dream scenario.

00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:32.756
But that didn't stop the FBI.

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:36.092
They provided Sami Osmakac 
everything he needed.

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:39.804
They gave him a car bomb,
they gave him an AK-47,

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:42.386
they helped him make a so-called
martyrdom video,

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:44.480
and they even gave 
him money for a taxi cab

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.944
so that he could get to where
they wanted him to go.

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:49.814
As they were working the sting,

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:53.327
the squad supervisor tells his agents
he wanted a Hollywood ending.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.168
And he got a Hollywood ending.

00:04:57.048 --> 00:04:59.609
When Sami Osmakac attempted
to deliver what he thought

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:00.905
was a car bomb,

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:04.584
he was arrested, convicted and 
sentenced to 40 years in prison.

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:08.223
Sami Osmakac isn't alone.

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:10.825
He's one of more than 
175 so-called terrorists,

00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:13.803
for whom the FBI has created 
Hollywood endings.

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:18.512
U.S. government officials call this
the War on Terror.

00:05:18.982 --> 00:05:20.759
It's really just theater,

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.089
a national security theater,

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.574
with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac

00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:28.621
unwitting actors in a 
carefully choreographed production

00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:30.829
brought to you by the FBI.

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:31.956
Thank you.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.870
(Applause)

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.421
Tom Rielly: So, those are some
pretty strong accusations,

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:45.938
pretty strong charges.

00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:48.711
How can you back this up?

00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:50.727
Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010

00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:53.795
when I received a grant from the 
Investigative Reporting Program

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:54.730
at U.C. Berkeley,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.162
and a research assistant and I

00:05:56.162 --> 00:05:58.635
put together a database
of all terrorism prosecutions

00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:01.638
at the time during 
the first decade after 9/11.

00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:04.458
And we used the court file
to find out whether

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:07.881
the defendants had any connections
to international terrorist groups,

00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.364
whether an informant was used,

00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:12.506
and whether the informant
played the role of an agent provocateur

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.373
by providing the means and opportunity.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.950
And we submitted that to the FBI

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.064
and we asked them to respond
to our database.

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:20.021
If they believed there were any errors,

00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:23.154
we asked them to tell us what they were
and we'd go back and check

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:25.382
and they never challenged any
of our findings.

00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:27.580
Later, I used that data 
in a magazine article

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.629
and later in my book,

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.176
and on appearances on places
like CBS and NPR,

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:33.083
they were offered that opportunity again

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.333
to say, "Trevor Aaronson's 
findings are wrong."

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.193
And they've never
come forward and said,

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:39.314
"These are the problems
with those findings."

00:06:39.314 --> 00:06:42.455
So the data has since been used 
by groups like Human Rights Watch

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:45.157
on its recent report on 
these types of sting operations.

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:47.796
And so far, the FBI has never 
really responded

00:06:47.796 --> 00:06:51.022
to these charges that it's really
not catching terrorists

00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:53.167
so much as it's catching
mentally ill people

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:56.529
that it can dress up as terrorists 
in these types of sting operations.

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.327
TR: So The Intercept is that new
investigative journalism website,

00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:03.095
that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:06.674
Tell us about your article 
and why there.

00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:09.654
TA: The Intercept seemed to be
the most logical place for this

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:12.723
because my article is 
really leveraging the fact that

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:15.208
a source had leaked to me
transcripts of these

00:07:15.208 --> 00:07:18.155
private FBI conversations
that a federal judge had sealed

00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:20.556
based on the government's claim 
that their release

00:07:20.556 --> 00:07:22.748
would irreparably damage 
the U.S. government's

00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:24.852
law enforcement strategy.

00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:27.831
So a place like The Intercept
was set up to protect journalists

00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:28.890
and publish their work

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.719
when they're dealing with 
very sensitive matters like this.

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.618
So my story in The Intercept, 
which was just published today,

00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:37.953
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac
was set up in this FBI sting

00:07:37.953 --> 00:07:39.633
and goes into much greater detail.

00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:42.597
In this talk, I could only
highlight the things that they said,

00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:44.434
such as calling him a "retarded fool."

00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:45.916
But it was much more elaborate,

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:49.012
they went to great lengths
to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,

00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:52.068
which he then used to purchase weapons
from the undercover agent.

00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:53.208
When he went to trial,

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:56.339
the central piece of evidence 
was that he paid for these weapons,

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:59.260
when in truth, these transcripts show
how the FBI orchestrated

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.660
someone who was essentially
mentally ill and broke

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.879
to get money to then 
pay for weapons

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.387
that they could then charge him
in a conspiracy for.

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:08.514
TR: One final question.

00:08:08.514 --> 00:08:10.035
Less than 10 days ago,

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:13.187
the FBI arrested some potential 
ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,

00:08:13.187 --> 00:08:16.715
saying that they might
be headed to Syria,

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:19.622
and were those real,
or examples of more of the same?

00:08:19.622 --> 00:08:22.636
TA: Well so far, we only know
what's come out in the court file,

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:25.641
but they seem to suggest it's another
example of the same.

00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.823
These types of sting operations 
have moved from flavor to flavor.

00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.991
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:33.305
and now the Islamic State
is the current flavor.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:36.874
What's worth noting about that case
is that the three men that were charged

00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:38.724
only began the plot to go to Syria

00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:40.801
after the introduction
of the FBI informant,

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.251
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
them with the travel documents

00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:45.167
that they needed.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:47.784
In kind of a comical turn 
in that particular case,

00:08:47.784 --> 00:08:49.850
one of the defendant's mother
had found out

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.016
that he was interested in going to Syria
and had hid his passport.

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:55.949
So it's unclear that even if he had
showed up at the airport,

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:57.777
that he ever could have gone anywhere.

00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:01.420
So yes, there are people who might
be interested in joining the Islamic State

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.428
in the United States,

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:06.050
and those are people that the United 
States government should be looking at

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.329
to see if they're interested
in violence here.

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:11.509
In this particular case, given
the evidence that's so far come out,

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.904
it suggests the FBI made
it possible for these guys

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:15.984
to move along in a plan to go to Syria

00:09:15.984 --> 00:09:18.582
when they were never close 
to that in the first place.

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.825
TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing.
TA: Thank you.

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:21.616
(Applause)
