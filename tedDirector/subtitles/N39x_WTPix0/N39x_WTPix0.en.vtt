00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.372
Anyone in the room thought about sex today?

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:16.532
(Laughter)

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:17.737
Yeah, you did.

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:20.203
Thank you for putting your hand up over there.

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:21.923
Well, I'm here to provide you with

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:23.618
some biological validation

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:25.048
for your sordid daydreams.

00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:26.442
I'm here to tell you a few things

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:29.948
that you might not have known about wild sex.

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.796
Now, when humans think about sex,

00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:33.526
male and female forms

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.197
are generally what come to mind,

00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:37.650
but for many millions of years,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.271
such specific categories didn't even exist.

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:42.874
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:44.484
or a trickle of DNA

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:47.026
shared between two or more beings.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.351
It wasn't until about 500 million years ago

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.715
that we start to see structures akin to a penis

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.373
or a thing that gives DNA out,

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:58.527
and a vagina, something that receives it.

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.852
Now invariably, you're probably thinking about

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.272
what belongs to our own species,

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.170
these very familiar structures,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.456
but the diversity that we see in sexual structures

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.444
in the animal kingdom that has evolved

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.092
in response to the multitude of factors

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:13.753
surrounding reproduction

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:16.147
is pretty mind-blowing.

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:19.788
Penile diversity is especially profuse.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.933
So this is a paper nautilus.

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.843
It's a close relative of squid and octopus,

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:27.965
and males have a hectocotylus.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.715
Just what is a hectocotylus?

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:33.894
A detachable, swimming penis.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.303
It leaves the [body of the male],

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:39.503
finds the female through
pheromonal cues in the water,

00:01:39.503 --> 00:01:41.414
attaches itself to her body

00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:42.722
and deposits the sperm.

00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:45.246
For many decades, biologists actually felt

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:49.691
that the hectocotylus was a
separate organism altogether.

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.679
Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.627
And the tapir has a prehensile penis.

00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:58.669
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:01.095
much akin to what we have with our hands.

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.767
And it uses this dexterity

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.983
to bypass the vagina altogether

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:08.354
and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:11.908
not to mention it's a pretty good size.

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:13.837
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,

00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:15.532
however, is not that of the tapir.

00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:17.864
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:19.558
in the animal kingdom actually belongs

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:21.809
to the meager beach barnacle,

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.001
and this video is actually showing you

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.085
what the human penis would look like

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:29.546
if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:32.732
(Laughter)

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:34.995
Mm-hm. (Laughter)

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:37.793
So with all of this diversity in structure,

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:39.950
one might think, then, that penises

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.921
are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.998
for the purposes of successful reproduction.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.543
Simply insert part A into slot B,

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:49.618
and we should all be good to go.

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:51.947
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:54.875
and that's because we can't
just take form into account.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.157
We have to think about function as well,

00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:58.947
and when it comes to sex,

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:01.473
function relates to the contributions made

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.272
by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.

00:03:04.272 --> 00:03:07.606
And these contributions are far from equal.

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.992
Eggs are very expensive to make,

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:12.943
so it makes sense for females to be very choosy

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.380
about who she shares them with.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.193
Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,

00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:21.045
so it makes more sense for males

00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:23.195
to have a more-sex-is-better strategy

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:24.607
when it comes to siring members

00:03:24.607 --> 00:03:26.453
of future generations.

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:28.165
So how do animals cope

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:31.050
with these very incongruent
needs between the sexes?

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.299
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.738
or if she has the ability to store sperm

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:38.415
and she simply has enough,

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:40.488
then it makes more sense for her to spend her time

00:03:40.488 --> 00:03:43.166
doing other biologically relevant things:

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:46.023
avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,

00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:48.193
gathering and ingesting food.

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.506
This is, of course, bad news for any male

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:53.057
who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:56.162
and this sets the scene for
some pretty drastic strategies

00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:59.468
for successful fertilization.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:01.475
This is bedbug sex,

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:05.749
and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.543
Males have a spiked, barbed penis

00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:11.147
that they literally stab into the female,

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:14.008
and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:16.143
They stab it anywhere in her body,

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:17.940
and the sperm simply migrates

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.244
through her hemolymph to her ovaries.

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.388
If a female gets too many stab wounds,

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.734
or if a stab wound happens to become infected,

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.113
she can actually die from it.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:29.884
Now if you've ever been out for a nice,

00:04:29.884 --> 00:04:31.775
peaceful walk by the lake

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:34.517
and happened to see some ducks having sex,

00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:36.212
you've undoubtedly been alarmed,

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.723
because it looks like gang rape.

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:41.384
And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.

00:04:41.384 --> 00:04:43.604
A group of males will grab a female,

00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:44.773
hold her down,

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:49.203
and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:52.287
into her corkscrew-shaped vagina

00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:55.193
over and over and over again.

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:58.982
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:01.117
Now the female actually
gets the last laugh, though,

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:03.944
because she can actually manipulate her posture

00:05:03.944 --> 00:05:07.049
so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:10.311
better access to her ovaries.

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:12.421
Now, I like to share stories
like this with my audiences

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.877
because, yeah, we humans,

00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:17.022
we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,

00:05:17.022 --> 00:05:19.263
there's romance, and there's orgasm.

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:20.945
But orgasm didn't actually evolve

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.031
until about 65 million years ago

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.798
with the advent of mammals.

00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:27.662
But some animals had it going
on quite a bit before that.

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:29.416
There are some more primitive ways

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:31.817
of pleasing one's partner.

00:05:31.817 --> 00:05:33.873
Earwig males have either

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:35.631
really large penile appendages

00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:37.032
or really small ones.

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:39.853
It's a very simple genetically inherited trait

00:05:39.853 --> 00:05:41.839
and the males are not otherwise any different.

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.801
Those that have long penile appendages

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.569
are not bigger or stronger

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.073
or otherwise any different at all.

00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.614
So going back to our biological minds, then,

00:05:49.614 --> 00:05:51.731
we might think that females should choose

00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.712
to have sex with the guys that
have the shorter appendages,

00:05:54.712 --> 00:05:57.277
because she can use her time for other things:

00:05:57.277 --> 00:05:58.953
avoiding predators, taking care of young,

00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:00.801
finding and ingesting food.

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.617
But biologists have repeatedly observed

00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:05.585
that females choose to have sex

00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:09.714
with the males that have the long appendages.

00:06:09.714 --> 00:06:11.677
Why do they do this?

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.076
Well, according to the biological literature,

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:16.903
"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males

00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:19.523
may elicit more favorable female responses

00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:22.600
through superior mechanical
or stimulatory interaction

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.158
with the female reproductive tract."

00:06:26.158 --> 00:06:28.549
Mm-hm.

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:30.486
These are Mexican guppies,

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:32.617
and what you see on their upper maxilla

00:06:32.617 --> 00:06:35.019
is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.864
and these filaments basically form

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:39.462
a fish mustache, if you will.

00:06:39.462 --> 00:06:41.804
Now males have been observed to prod

00:06:41.804 --> 00:06:43.468
the female's genital opening

00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:45.415
prior to copulating with her,

00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:48.924
and in what I have lovingly termed
the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:52.936
females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found

00:06:52.936 --> 00:06:56.901
with males that have these fish mustaches.

00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.198
A little guppy porn for you right there.

00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:02.954
So we've seen very different strategies

00:07:02.954 --> 00:07:05.192
that males are using when it comes to

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.788
winning a female partner.

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:11.776
We've seen a coercion strategy in which
sexual structures are used in a forceful way

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:13.549
to basically make a female have sex.

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:15.606
We've also seen a titillation strategy

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:17.543
where males are actually

00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:19.691
pleasing their female partners into choosing them

00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:21.410
as a sex partner.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.855
Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:26.271
it's the coercion strategy that we see

00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.010
time and time again.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.357
It's very common in many phyla,

00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:32.990
from invertebrates to avian species,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.536
mammals, and, of course, even in primates.

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:39.073
Now interestingly, there 
are a few mammalian species

00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:42.305
in which females have evolved specialized genitalia

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:46.974
that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:49.342
Female elephants and female hyenas

00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:51.716
have a penile clitoris,

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:55.523
or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,

00:07:55.523 --> 00:07:57.082
much like a penis,

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:59.466
and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals

00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:02.633
by merely looking at their external morphology.

00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:06.225
So before a male can insert
his penis into a female's vagina,

00:08:06.225 --> 00:08:08.080
she has to take this penile clitoris

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.643
and basically inside-out it in her own body.

00:08:11.643 --> 00:08:14.580
I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.112
It's simply not going to happen

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:19.434
unless the female is on board with the action.

00:08:19.434 --> 00:08:21.247
Now, even more interesting is the fact

00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:23.256
that elephant and hyena societies

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:25.685
are entirely matriarchal:

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:28.187
they're run by females, groups of females,

00:08:28.187 --> 00:08:30.433
sisters, aunts and offspring,

00:08:30.433 --> 00:08:33.636
and when young males attain sexual maturity,

00:08:33.636 --> 00:08:35.513
they're turfed out of the group.

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:37.596
In hyena societies, adult males

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:40.858
are actually the lowest on the social scale.

00:08:40.858 --> 00:08:43.291
They can take part in a kill only after

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.021
everybody else, including the offspring.

00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:48.339
So it seems that when you take the penis power

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:50.177
away from a male,

00:08:50.177 --> 00:08:54.236
you take away all the social power he has.

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:56.878
So what are my take-home
messages from my talk today?

00:08:56.878 --> 00:08:59.559
Well, sex is just so much more

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:02.158
than insert part A into slot B

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:05.300
and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.957
The sexual strategies and reproductive structures

00:09:07.957 --> 00:09:10.980
that we see in the animal kingdom basically

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.908
dictate how males and females
will react to each other,

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:17.654
which then dictates how populations and societies

00:09:17.654 --> 00:09:19.269
form and evolve.

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:21.753
So it may not be surprising to any of you

00:09:21.753 --> 00:09:23.561
that animals, including ourselves,

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:27.171
spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:30.347
but what might surprise you is the extent to which

00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:34.418
so many other aspects of their lives and our lives

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:36.240
are influenced by it.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.203
So thank you, and happy daydreaming.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:42.282
