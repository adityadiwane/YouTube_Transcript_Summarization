00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.611
I visit the future for a living.

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:17.891
Not just one future,

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:20.161
but many possible futures,

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:24.304
bringing back evidences from those futures
for you to experience today.

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:27.420
Like an archaeologist of the future.

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:31.164
Over the years, my many journeys
have brought back things

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:34.213
like a new species
of synthetically engineered bees;

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:39.435
a book named, "Pets as Protein;"

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:43.427
a machine that makes you rich
by trading your genetic data;

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.498
a lamp powered by sugar;

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.926
a computer for growing food.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:52.964
OK, so I don't actually travel
to different futures -- yet.

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:55.927
But my husband Jon and I spend
a lot of time thinking

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:59.641
and creating visions
of different futures in our studio.

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.857
We are constantly looking out
for weak signals,

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.255
those murmurs of future potential.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.352
Then we trace those threads of potential
out into the future, asking:

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:12.498
What might it feel like
to live in this future?

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:15.903
What might we see, hear and even breathe?

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:21.606
Then we run experiments,
build prototypes, make objects,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660
bringing aspects of these futures to life,

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.996
making them concrete and tangible

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.774
so you can really feel the impact
of those future possibilities

00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:31.965
here and now.

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:35.737
But this work is not about predictions.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.768
It's about creating tools --

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:41.256
tools that can help connect
our present and our future selves

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.685
so we become active participants
in creating a future we want --

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.565
a future that works for all.

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:50.573
So how do we go about doing this?

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:54.487
For a recent project called Drone Aviary,

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.049
we were interested in exploring

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:59.040
what it would mean to live
with drones in our cities.

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:01.897
Drones that have the power
to see things we can't,

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.673
to go places we can't

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:05.896
and to do so with increasing autonomy.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.324
But to understand the technology,

00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:10.217
getting our hands dirty was crucial.

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:13.482
So we built several different
drones in our studio.

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:16.610
We gave them names, functions
and then flew them --

00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:18.908
but not without difficulty.

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:20.802
Things came loose,

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.446
GPS signals glitched

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.882
and drones crashed.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.741
But it was through such experimentation

00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:30.940
that we could construct a very
concrete and very experiential slice

00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:32.587
of one possible future.

00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:35.688
So now, let's go to that future.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.569
Let's imagine we are living in a city
with drones like this one.

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.123
We call it The Nightwatchman.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:46.645
It patrols the streets, often spotted
in the evenings and at night.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.639
Initially, many of us were annoyed
by its low, dull hum.

00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:53.912
But then, like everything else,
we got used to it.

00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:57.157
Now, what if you could see
the world through its eyes?

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:02.937
See how it constantly logs
every resident of our neighborhood;

00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:06.281
logging the kids who play football
in the no-ballgame area

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.752
and marking them as statutory nuisances.

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:10.213
(Laughter)

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:14.207
And then see how it disperses
this other group, who are teenagers,

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.345
with the threat of an autonomously
issued injunction.

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:21.520
And then there's this giant
floating disc called Madison.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:24.423
Its glaring presence is so overpowering,

00:03:24.447 --> 00:03:26.600
I can't help but stare at it.

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:29.243
But if feels like each time I look at it,

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.081
it knows a little more about me --

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:35.079
like it keeps flashing all these
Brianair adverts at me,

00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:37.447
as if it knows about
the holiday I'm planning.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.206
I'm not sure if I find this
mildly entertaining

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.042
or just entirely invasive.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.008
Back to the present.

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:49.834
In creating this future, we learned a lot.

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:52.958
Not just about how these machines work,

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.841
but what it would feel like
to live alongside them.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.493
Whilst drones like Madison
and Nightwatchman,

00:03:58.517 --> 00:04:00.034
in these particular forms,

00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:01.599
are not real yet,

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:05.580
most elements of a drone future
are in fact very real today.

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:07.415
For instance,

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.753
facial recognition systems
are everywhere --

00:04:09.777 --> 00:04:12.187
in our phones, even in our thermostats

00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:14.041
and in cameras around our cities --

00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:17.460
keeping a record of everything we do,

00:04:17.484 --> 00:04:21.669
whether it's an advertisement
we glanced at or a protest we attended.

00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:23.363
These things are here,

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:26.111
and we often don't understand
how they work,

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.985
and what their consequences could be.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.859
And we see this all around us.

00:04:30.883 --> 00:04:32.655
This difficulty in even imagining

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.823
how the consequences of our actions
today will affect our future.

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:40.534
Last year, where I live, in the UK,
there was a referendum

00:04:40.558 --> 00:04:43.083
where the people could vote
for the UK to leave the EU

00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:44.265
or stay in the EU,

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.991
popularly known as "Brexit."

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.621
And soon after the results came out,

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:51.660
a word began to surface
called "Bregret" --

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:52.724
(Laughter)

00:04:52.748 --> 00:04:56.183
describing people who chose to vote
for Brexit as a protest,

00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:59.297
but without thinking through
its potential consequences.

00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:04.551
And this disconnect is evident
in some of the simplest things.

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:07.664
Say you go out for a quick drink.

00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:10.422
Then you decide
you wouldn't mind a few more.

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:13.066
You know you'll wake up
in the morning feeling awful,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.472
but you justify it by saying,

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.999
"The other me in the future
will deal with that."

00:05:17.607 --> 00:05:19.475
But as we find out in the morning,

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.464
that future "you" is you.

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:25.651
When I was growing up in India
in the late '70s and early '80s,

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:26.826
there was a feeling

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.837
that the future both needed to
and could actually be planned.

00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:33.603
I remember my parents had to plan
for some of the simplest things.

00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:35.656
When they wanted a telephone in our house,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.990
they needed to order it and then wait --

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:41.261
wait for nearly five years before
it got installed in our house.

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:42.319
(Laughter)

00:05:42.343 --> 00:05:45.841
And then if they wanted to call
my grandparents who lived in another city,

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:48.393
they needed to book
something called a "trunk call,"

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.677
and then wait again,
for hours or even days.

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:54.235
And then abruptly, the phone
would ring at two in the morning,

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.509
and all of us would jump out of our beds
and gather round the phone,

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.848
shrieking into it,
discussing general well-being

00:05:59.872 --> 00:06:01.205
at two in the morning.

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.009
Today it can feel like things
are happening too fast --

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.288
so fast, that it can
become really difficult

00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:10.269
for us to form an understanding
of our place in history.

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:13.720
It creates an overwhelming sense
of uncertainty and anxiety,

00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:16.786
and so, we let the future
just happen to us.

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:20.027
We don't connect with that future "us."

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:22.840
We treat our future selves as a stranger,

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:24.832
and the future as a foreign land.

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:26.920
It's not a foreign land;

00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:28.692
it's unfolding right in front of us,

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:31.280
continually being shaped
by our actions today.

00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:33.224
We are that future,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.770
and so I believe fighting
for a future we want

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:39.417
is more urgent and necessary
than ever before.

00:06:40.297 --> 00:06:41.762
We have learned in our work

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:45.230
that one of the most powerful means
of effecting change

00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:49.398
is when people can directly, tangibly
and emotionally experience

00:06:49.422 --> 00:06:52.450
some of the future consequences
of their actions today.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.104
Earlier this year, the government
of the United Arab Emirates invited us

00:06:57.128 --> 00:06:59.574
to help them shape
their country's energy strategy

00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:01.182
all the way up to 2050.

00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:05.816
Based on the government's econometric
data, we created this large city model,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.908
and visualized many
possible futures on it.

00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:13.707
As I was excitably taking a group
of government officials

00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:15.268
and members of energy companies

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.823
through one sustainable
future on our model,

00:07:17.847 --> 00:07:19.577
one of the participants told me,

00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:23.229
"I cannot imagine that in the future
people will stop driving cars

00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:25.051
and start using public transport."

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:27.076
And then he said,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.706
"There's no way I can tell my own son
to stop driving his car."

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.908
But we were prepared for this reaction.

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:38.545
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab
in my home city in India,

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.744
we had created approximate samples

00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:45.518
of what the air would be like in 2030
if our behavior stays the same.

00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:49.886
And so, I walked the group
over to this object

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.257
that emits vapor from those air samples.

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:57.050
Just one whiff of the noxious
polluted air from 2030

00:07:57.074 --> 00:08:00.191
brought home the point
that no amount of data can.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.121
This is not the future you would want
your children to inherit.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.185
The next day, the government
made a big announcement.

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:10.372
They would be investing billions
of dollars in renewables.

00:08:10.396 --> 00:08:14.775
We don't know what part our future
experiences played in this decision,

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:17.291
but we know that they've changed
their energy policy

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:18.799
to mitigate such a scenario.

00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:22.328
While something like air from the future
is very effective and tangible,

00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:25.182
the trajectory from our present
to a future consequence

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:26.511
is not always so linear.

00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:30.520
Even when a technology
is developed with utopian ideals,

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.277
the moment it leaves the laboratory
and enters the world,

00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:36.646
it is subject to forces outside
of the creators' control.

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:41.851
For one particular project,
we investigated medical genomics:

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.966
the technology of gathering
and using people's genetic data

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.849
to create personalized medicine.

00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:48.646
We were asking:

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.394
What are some of the unintended
consequences of linking our genetics

00:08:52.418 --> 00:08:53.579
to health care?

00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:57.441
To explore this question further,

00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:59.357
we created a fictional lawsuit,

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:04.300
and brought it to life through 31 pieces
of carefully crafted evidence.

00:09:04.783 --> 00:09:07.871
So we built an illegal genetic clinic,

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:11.078
a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.438
and even bought frozen mice on eBay.

00:09:14.273 --> 00:09:17.428
So now let's go to that future
where this lawsuit is unfolding,

00:09:17.452 --> 00:09:19.574
and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:23.759
Arnold is being prosecuted
by this global giant biotech company

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:25.081
called Dynamic Genetics,

00:09:25.627 --> 00:09:27.117
because they have evidence

00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:31.731
that Arnold has illegally inserted
the company's patented genetic material

00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:33.249
into his body.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.863
How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.027
Well, it all started

00:09:38.051 --> 00:09:42.234
when Arnold was asked to submit
a saliva sample in this spit kit

00:09:42.258 --> 00:09:43.816
to the NHI --

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.790
the UK's National Health
Insurance service.

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:50.209
When Arnold received
his health insurance bill,

00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:51.945
he was shocked and scared

00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:54.351
to see that his premiums
had gone through the roof,

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:57.349
beyond anything he or his family
could ever afford.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.651
The state's algorithm had scanned
his genetic data

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:04.683
and found the risk of a chronic health
condition lurking in his DNA.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:08.499
And so Arnold had to start paying
toward the potential costs

00:10:08.523 --> 00:10:10.199
of that future disease --

00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:12.406
potential future disease from today.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.042
In that moment of fear and panic,

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.572
Arnold slipped through the city

00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:18.654
into the dark shadows
of this illegal clinic for treatment --

00:10:19.457 --> 00:10:21.618
a treatment that would modify his DNA

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:25.300
so that the state's algorithm
would no longer see him as a risk,

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.301
and his insurance premiums
would become affordable again.

00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:30.010
But Arnold was caught.

00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:34.112
And the legal proceedings in the case
Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.

00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:36.653
In bringing such a future to life,

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:39.631
what was important to us
was that people could actually touch,

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:41.223
see and feel its potential,

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.752
because such an immediate and close
encounter provokes people

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:46.267
to ask the right questions,

00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:48.087
questions like:

00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:50.297
What are the implications
of living in a world

00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:52.310
where I'm judged on my genetics?

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:56.186
Or: Who might claim ownership
to my genetic data,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.720
and what might they do with it?

00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:02.027
If this feels even slightly
out-there or farfetched,

00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:05.843
today there's a little-known bill
being passed through the American congress

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:09.916
known as HR 1313, Preserving
Employee Wellness Programs Act.

00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:14.935
This bill proposes to amend the Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act,

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:16.665
popularly known as GINA,

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:19.997
and would allow employers to ask
about family medical history

00:11:20.021 --> 00:11:21.205
and genetic data

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:23.798
to all employees for the first time.

00:11:24.938 --> 00:11:27.532
Those who refuse
would face large penalties.

00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:31.100
In the work I've shown so far,

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.287
whether it was drones or genetic crimes,

00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:35.669
these stories describe troubling futures

00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:38.445
with the intention of helping us
avoid those futures.

00:11:39.004 --> 00:11:40.981
But what about what we can't avoid?

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:43.669
Today, especially with climate change,

00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:45.763
it looks like we are heading for trouble.

00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:49.350
And so what we want to do now
is to prepare for that future

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:53.631
by developing tools and attitudes
that can help us find hope --

00:11:54.322 --> 00:11:56.094
hope that can inspire action.

00:11:56.908 --> 00:11:59.596
Currently, we are running
an experiment in our studio.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.097
It's a work in progress.

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:03.763
Based on climate data projections,

00:12:03.787 --> 00:12:05.343
we are exploring a future

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:08.800
where the Western world has moved
from abundance to scarcity.

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:12.235
We imagine living in a future city
with repeated flooding,

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:14.996
periods with almost
no food in supermarkets,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.756
economic instabilities,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.465
broken supply chains.

00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:23.167
What can we do to not just survive,
but prosper in such a world?

00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:25.361
What food can we eat?

00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:27.982
To really step inside these questions,

00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:31.820
we are building this room in a flat
in London from 2050.

00:12:32.654 --> 00:12:35.970
It's like a little time capsule
that we reclaimed from the future.

00:12:35.994 --> 00:12:38.140
We stripped it down to the bare minimum.

00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:40.070
Everything we lovingly put in our homes,

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:41.770
like flat-panel TVs,

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.590
internet-connected fridges

00:12:43.614 --> 00:12:45.043
and artisanal furnishings

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:46.389
all had to go.

00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:49.315
And in its place,
we're building food computers

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:52.193
from abandoned, salvaged
and repurposed materials,

00:12:52.715 --> 00:12:55.122
turning today's waste
into tomorrow's dinner.

00:12:56.707 --> 00:12:57.858
For instance,

00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:01.870
we've just finished building our first
fully automated fogponics machine.

00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:05.310
It uses the technique of fogponics --
so just fog as a nutrient,

00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:06.913
not even water or soil --

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:08.332
to grow things quickly.

00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:10.543
At the moment,

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:12.291
we have successfully grown tomatoes.

00:13:13.254 --> 00:13:16.381
But we'll need more food than what
we can grow in this small room.

00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:18.940
So what else could we forage
from the city?

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.881
Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?

00:13:25.794 --> 00:13:28.363
Earlier, we brought back
air from the future.

00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:31.110
This time we are bringing
an entire room from the future,

00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.481
a room full of hope, tools and tactics

00:13:33.505 --> 00:13:36.640
to create positive action
in hostile conditions.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:38.975
Spending time in this room,

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:41.062
a room that could be our own future home,

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:44.648
makes the consequences
of climate change and food insecurity

00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:46.911
much more immediate and tangible.

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:52.083
What we're learning through such
experiments and our practice

00:13:52.107 --> 00:13:53.598
and the people we engage with

00:13:53.622 --> 00:13:55.873
is that creating concrete experiences

00:13:55.897 --> 00:13:59.210
can bridge the disconnect
between today and tomorrow.

00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:02.655
By putting ourselves
into different possible futures,

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:04.241
by becoming open and willing

00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:08.605
to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort
that such an act can bring,

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:11.714
we have the opportunity
to imagine new possibilities.

00:14:12.223 --> 00:14:14.127
We can find optimistic futures;

00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:15.992
we can find paths forward;

00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:18.068
we can move beyond hope into action.

00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:22.061
It means we have the chance
to change direction,

00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:25.119
a chance to have our voices heard,

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:30.047
a chance to write ourselves
into a future we want.

00:14:31.548 --> 00:14:33.586
Other worlds are possible.

00:14:34.469 --> 00:14:35.636
Thank you.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.849
(Applause)
