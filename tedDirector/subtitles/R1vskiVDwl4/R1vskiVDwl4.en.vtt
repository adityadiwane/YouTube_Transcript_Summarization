00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.793
All right, I want to see a show of hands:

00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:17.216
how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.096
because they said something offensive
about politics or religion,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.256
childcare, food?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.216
(Laughter)

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.056
And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.360
because you just don't want
to talk to them?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.936
(Laughter)

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.176
You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.416
we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.256
Stick to the weather and your health.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.656
But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.976
(Laughter)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.296
are not safe either.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.760
So this world that we live in,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.096
this world in which every conversation

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.296
has the potential
to devolve into an argument,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.606
where our politicians
can't speak to one another

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.936
and where even the most trivial of issues

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.936
have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.056
Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.816
and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.136
we are more divided,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.936
than we ever have been in history.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.536
We're less likely to compromise,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.736
which means we're
not listening to each other.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.296
And we make decisions about where to live,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.936
who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.056
based on what we already believe.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.056
Again, that means
we're not listening to each other.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.416
A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.096
and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.016
Now, part of that is due to technology.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.616
The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.296
or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.616
According to Pew Research,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.536
about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.136
And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.240
than they are to talk
to them face to face.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.136
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.016
It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.176
And he gave his kids
a communication project.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.936
He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.865
And he said this: "I came to realize..."

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.176
(Laughter)

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.376
"I came to realize
that conversational competence

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.496
might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.816
Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.696
but rarely do they have an opportunity

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.296
to hone their interpersonal
communications skills.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.496
It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves:

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.456
Is there any 21st-century skill

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.056
more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?"

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.296
Now, I make my living talking to people:

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.576
Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.016
billionaires, kindergarten teachers,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.736
heads of state, plumbers.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.808
I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don't like.

00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:55.616
I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.416
But I still have
a great conversation with them.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.336
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.720
and how to listen.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.416
Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.416
things like look the person in the eye,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.256
think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.056
look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.976
repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.736
So I want you to forget all of that.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.976
It is crap.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.016
(Laughter)

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.296
There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.976
if you are in fact paying attention.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.856
(Laughter)

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.776
(Applause)

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.456
Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.416
that I do in regular life.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.896
So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.736
and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.136
Learn to have a conversation

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.496
without wasting your time,
without getting bored,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.816
and, please God,
without offending anybody.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.056
We've all had really great conversations.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.256
We've had them before.
We know what it's like.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.976
The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.456
or where you feel
like you've made a real connection

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.576
or you've been perfectly understood.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.816
There is no reason

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.096
why most of your interactions
can't be like that.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.336
So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.096
but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.856
you'll already enjoy better conversations.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.096
Number one: Don't multitask.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.296
And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.176
or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.096
I mean, be present.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.376
Be in that moment.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.016
Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.656
Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.736
If you want to get out
of the conversation,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.136
get out of the conversation,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.296
but don't be half in it
and half out of it.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.896
Number two: Don't pontificate.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.096
If you want to state your opinion

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.056
without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.536
write a blog.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.616
(Laughter)

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.016
Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show:

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.816
Because they're really boring.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.698
If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:16.696
If they're liberal, they're going to hate

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.936
big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.216
Totally predictable.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.936
And you don't want to be like that.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.496
You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.656
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.096
that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.440
And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.496
He said that sensing this acceptance,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.776
the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.656
and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.336
of his or her mind to the listener.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.120
Again, assume that you have
something to learn.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.560
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't."

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.576
I put it this way:

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.760
Everybody is an expert in something.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.976
Number three: Use open-ended questions.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.056
In this case, take a cue from journalists.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.176
Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.896
If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.256
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.456
you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.816
which is "terrified," and the answer is
"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.840
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:28.936
Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.936
Try asking them things like,
"What was that like?"

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.416
"How did that feel?"

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.736
Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.736
and you're going to get
a much more interesting response.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.080
Number four: Go with the flow.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.536
That means thoughts
will come into your mind

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.616
and you need to let them
go out of your mind.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.616
We've heard interviews often

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.096
in which a guest is talking
for several minutes

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.536
and then the host comes back in
and asks a question

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.976
which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.936
That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.376
because he thought
of this really clever question,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.416
and he was just bound
and determined to say that.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.416
And we do the exact same thing.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.056
We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.536
and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.896
(Laughter)

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.536
And we stop listening.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.616
Stories and ideas
are going to come to you.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.520
You need to let them come and let them go.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.800
Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.096
Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.056
are much more aware
that they're going on the record,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.656
and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.816
and what they claim to know for sure.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.216
Do that. Err on the side of caution.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.000
Talk should not be cheap.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.320
Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.056
If they're talking
about having lost a family member,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.936
don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.816
If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.176
don't tell them about
how much you hate your job.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.136
It's not the same. It is never the same.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.936
All experiences are individual.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.640
And, more importantly,
it is not about you.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.016
You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.440
or how much you've suffered.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.176
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.080
"I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers."

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.056
(Laughter)

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.440
Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.800
Number seven:

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.816
Try not to repeat yourself.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.216
It's condescending,
and it's really boring,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.896
and we tend to do it a lot.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.856
Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.136
we have a point to make,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.559
so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.856
Don't do that.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.176
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.015
Frankly, people don't care

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:54.655
about the years, the names,

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.616
the dates, all those details

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.096
that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.320
They don't care.
What they care about is you.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.480
They care about what you're like,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.776
what you have in common.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.440
So forget the details. Leave them out.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.096
Number nine:

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.376
This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.600
Listen.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.376
I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.296
that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.536
that you could develop.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.456
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.016
"If your mouth is open,
you're not learning."

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.320
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man
ever listened his way out of a job."

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.136
(Laughter)

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.360
Why do we not listen to each other?

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.880
Number one, we'd rather talk.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.296
When I'm talking, I'm in control.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.776
I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.176
I'm the center of attention.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.096
I can bolster my own identity.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.496
But there's another reason:

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.976
We get distracted.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.536
The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.856
but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.856
So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.056
And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.376
to actually pay attention to someone,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.376
but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.256
You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.536
in the same place.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.456
(Laughter)

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.976
You have to listen to one another.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.896
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.856
He said, "Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.560
We listen with the intent to reply."

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.816
One more rule, number 10,
and it's this one: Be brief.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.336
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt;
short enough to retain interest,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.776
but long enough to cover
the subject. -- My Sister]

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.016
(Laughter)

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.456
(Applause)

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.800
All of this boils down to the same
basic concept, and it is this one:

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.176
Be interested in other people.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.616
You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.696
and there was kind of a ritual in my home.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.176
People would come over
to talk to my grandparents,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.056
and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.056
and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.936
She was the runner-up to Miss America.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.656
He was the mayor of Sacramento.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.856
She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer."

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.256
And I kind of grew up assuming

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.040
everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.560
And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.096
I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.536
I keep my mind open,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.056
and I'm always prepared to be amazed,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.040
and I'm never disappointed.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.616
You do the same thing.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.056
Go out, talk to people,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.296
listen to people,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.800
and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.656
Thanks.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.960
(Applause)
