00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.341
A year ago, we were invited
by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:18.388
to present our art projects.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.133
We are used to invitations,
but this invitation really thrilled us.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.427
The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:29.419
It is the only old building
in the government district

00:00:29.443 --> 00:00:32.399
that was not destroyed
during the Second World War,

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:35.191
and it sits right next
to the Federal Chancellery.

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:39.839
No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel
than the Swiss diplomats.

00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:41.839
(Laughter)

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:46.475
The government district in Berlin
also contains the Reichstag --

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.310
Germany's parliament --
and the Brandenburg Gate,

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:52.275
and right next to the gate
there are other embassies,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.696
in particular the US
and the British Embassy.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:59.873
Although Germany is an advanced democracy,

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:02.858
citizens are limited
in their constitutional rights

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:04.275
in its government district.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.686
The right of assembly and the right
to demonstrate are restricted there.

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:13.275
And this is interesting
from an artistic point of view.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.011
The opportunities to exercise
participation and to express oneself

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.275
are always bound to a certain order

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.774
and always subject
to a specific regulation.

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:28.557
With an awareness of the dependencies
of these regulations,

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:31.275
we can gain a new perspective.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.953
The given terms and conditions
shape our perception, our actions

00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:37.564
and our lives.

00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:41.275
And this is crucial in another context.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.777
Over the last couple of years,

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:47.275
we learned that from the roofs
of the US and the British Embassy,

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.036
the secret services have been listening
to the entire district,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.756
including the mobile phone
of Angela Merkel.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.275
The antennas of the British GCHQ are
hidden in a white cylindrical radome,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.316
while the listening post
of the American NSA

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.299
is covered by radio transparent screens.

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:10.275
But how to address these hidden
and disguised forces?

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:13.275
With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.902
we accepted the invitation
of the Swiss Embassy.

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:20.886
And we used this opportunity
to exploit the specific situation.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.650
If people are spying on us,
it stands to reason

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:28.275
that they have to listen
to what we are saying.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.275
(Laughter)

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.299
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,
we installed a series of antennas.

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.983
They weren't as sophisticated as those
used by the Americans and the British.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.274
(Laughter)

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:46.021
They were makeshift can antennas,

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:49.034
not camouflaged but totally
obvious and visible.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.794
The Academy of Arts joined the project,

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:56.508
and so we built another
large antenna on their rooftop,

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:00.550
exactly between the listening posts
of the NSA and the GCHQ.

00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:02.430
(Laughter)

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:07.275
Never have we been observed in such detail
while building an art installation.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.551
A helicopter circled over our heads

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:12.805
with a camera registering
each and every move we made,

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.039
and on the roof of the US Embassy,
security officers patrolled.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:22.688
Although the government district
is governed by a strict police order,

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:26.871
there are no specific laws
relating to digital communication.

00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:31.031
Our installation
was therefore perfectly legal,

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:34.252
and the Swiss Ambassador
informed Chancellor Merkel about it.

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:37.980
We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"

00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:39.980
(Laughter)

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:45.066
The antennas created an open
and free Wi-Fi communication network

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.275
in which anyone who wanted to
would be able to participate

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.411
using any Wi-Fi-enabled device
without any hindrance,

00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:53.356
and be able to send messages

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.460
to those listening on the frequencies
that were being intercepted.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.005
Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.678
anything could be sent anonymously.

00:04:04.852 --> 00:04:07.275
And people did communicate.

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.275
Over 15,000 messages were sent.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.051
Here are some examples.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.811
"Hello world, hello Berlin,
hello NSA, hello GCHQ."

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.299
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!
Blow the whistle!"

00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:28.588
"This is the NSA. In God we trust.
All others we track!!!!!"

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:30.864
(Laughter)

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:36.275
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -
we are part of your organizations.

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.299
# expect us. We will #shutdown"

00:04:39.483 --> 00:04:42.943
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel.
Open Networks."

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:47.705
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself
will you tell your grandchildren?"

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:52.870
"@NSA My neighbors are noisy.
Please send a drone strike."

00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:55.346
(Laughter)

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.840
"Make Love, Not cyberwar."

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:02.275
We invited the embassies
and the government departments

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:05.105
to participate in the open network, too,

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.042
and to our surprise, they did.

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:09.986
Files appeared on the network,
including classified documents

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.628
leaked from the parliamentary
investigation commission,

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:16.342
which highlights that the free exchange
and discussion of vital information

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:20.706
is starting to become difficult,
even for members of a parliament.

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:25.068
We also organized guided tours
to experience and sound out

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:27.142
the power constellations on-site.

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:30.503
The tours visited the restricted zones
around the embassies,

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:34.926
and we discussed the potential
and the highlights of communication.

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:40.478
If we become aware of the constellation,

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:43.298
the terms and conditions of communication,

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.653
it not only broadens our horizon,

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:49.549
it allows us to look behind
the regulations that limit our worldview,

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:53.699
our specific social, political
or aesthetic conventions.

00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.414
Let's look at an actual example.

00:05:57.383 --> 00:06:00.470
The fate of people living
in the makeshift settlements

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:02.221
on the outskirts of Paris

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:04.409
is hidden and faded from view.

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.758
It's a vicious circle.

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:10.551
It's not poverty, not racism,
not exclusion that are new.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:14.093
What is new is how
these realities are hidden

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:15.745
and how people are made invisible

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:19.865
in an age of global and overwhelming
communication and exchange.

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:23.430
Such makeshift settlements
are considered illegal,

00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:26.726
and therefore those living in them
don't have a chance

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.551
of making their voices heard.

00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:34.001
On the contrary, every time they appear,
every time they risk becoming visible,

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:36.735
merely gives grounds
for further persecution,

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.768
expulsion and suppression.

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:43.996
What interested us was how we could
come to know this hidden side.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.409
We were searching for an interface
and we found one.

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:51.696
It's not a digital interface,
but a physical one: it's a hotel.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.235
We named the project "Hotel Gelem."

00:06:54.783 --> 00:06:58.616
Together with Roma families,
we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.599
for example, in Freiburg in Germany,
in Montreuil near Paris,

00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:03.275
and also in the Balkans.

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:04.660
These are real hotels.

00:07:04.684 --> 00:07:06.275
People can stay there.

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:08.275
But they aren't a commercial enterprise.

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:09.781
They are a symbol.

00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:14.227
You can go online and ask
for a personal invitation

00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:18.637
to come and live for a few days
in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,

00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:22.153
eating, working and living
with the Roma families.

00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:25.915
Here, the Roma families
are not the travelers;

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.234
the visitors are.

00:07:27.584 --> 00:07:30.639
Here, the Roma families
are not a minority;

00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:31.957
the visitors are.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:37.802
The point is not to make judgments,

00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:40.580
but rather to find out
about the context that determines

00:07:40.604 --> 00:07:43.803
these disparate and seemingly
insurmountable contradictions.

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:46.539
In the world of globalization,

00:07:46.563 --> 00:07:49.275
the continents are drifting
closer to each other.

00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.823
Cultures, goods and people
are in permanent exchange,

00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:55.101
but at the same time, the gap
between the world of the privileged

00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:57.973
and the world of the excluded is growing.

00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:01.275
We were recently in Australia.

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:03.900
For us, it was no problem
to enter the country.

00:08:03.924 --> 00:08:06.606
We have European passports,
visas and air tickets.

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:10.761
But asylum seekers who arrive
by boat in Australia

00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:12.821
are deported or taken to prison.

00:08:13.299 --> 00:08:14.774
The interception of the boats

00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:17.879
and the disappearance of the people
into the detention system

00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:20.546
are veiled by the Australian authorities.

00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:25.006
These procedures are declared
to be secret military operations.

00:08:25.768 --> 00:08:28.912
After dramatic escapes
from crisis zones and war zones,

00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:33.047
men, women and children
are detained by Australia without trial,

00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:35.044
sometimes for years.

00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:39.132
During our stay, however,

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:43.275
we managed to reach out and work
with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.501
despite strict screening and isolation.

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:50.166
From these contexts was born
an installation in the art space

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.275
of the Queensland University
of Technology in Brisbane.

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:57.690
On the face of it,
it was a very simple installation.

00:08:58.182 --> 00:09:01.587
On the floor, a stylized compass
gave the direction

00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:03.619
to each immigration detention center,

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:08.275
accompanied by the distance
and the name of the immigration facility.

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:12.275
But the exhibition step
came in the form of connectivity.

00:09:12.642 --> 00:09:16.275
Above every floor marking,
there was a headset.

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:20.915
Visitors were offered the opportunity
to talk directly to a refugee

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:23.275
who was or had been imprisoned

00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:25.487
in a specific detention facility

00:09:25.511 --> 00:09:27.932
and engage in a personal conversation.

00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:31.782
In the protected context
of the art exhibition,

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.433
asylum seekers felt free
to talk about themselves,

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:38.147
their story and their situation,
without fear of consequences.

00:09:38.694 --> 00:09:41.706
Visitors immersed themselves
in long conversations

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.483
about families torn apart,
about dramatic escapes from war zones,

00:09:45.507 --> 00:09:47.119
about suicide attempts,

00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:49.753
about the fate of children in detention.

00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:52.602
Emotions ran deep. Many wept.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:55.008
Several revisited the exhibition.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.372
It was a powerful experience.

00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:02.731
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.

00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:07.275
The situation for the asylum seekers
is made worse by contradictory policies

00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:10.594
and the temptation
of militarized responses.

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:13.989
We have also established
communication systems

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.081
in remote refugee centers
in Switzerland and Greece.

00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:20.853
They are all about providing
basic information -- weather forecasts,

00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:22.751
legal information, guidance.

00:10:23.163 --> 00:10:24.854
But they are significant.

00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:26.529
Information on the Internet

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:29.283
that could ensure survival
along dangerous routes

00:10:29.307 --> 00:10:30.700
is being censored,

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:35.411
and the provision of such information
is becoming increasingly criminalized.

00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.651
This brings us back to our network
and to the antennas

00:10:39.675 --> 00:10:41.905
on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:44.003
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.

00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:47.935
We should not take it for granted
to be boundlessly connected.

00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:49.992
We should start making
our own connections,

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:54.516
fighting for this idea of an equal
and globally interconnected world.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.275
This is essential to overcome
our speechlessness

00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:00.419
and the separation provoked
by rival political forces.

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:04.030
It is only in truly exposing ourselves

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:06.920
to the transformative power
of this experience

00:11:06.944 --> 00:11:10.275
that we can overcome
prejudice and exclusion.

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:11.453
Thank you.

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:16.811
(Applause)

00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:18.522
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.

00:11:18.546 --> 00:11:20.871
The other half of your
artistic duo is also here.

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:22.532
Christoph Wachter, come onstage.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:27.914
(Applause)

00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:29.343
First, tell me just a detail:

00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:31.446
the name of the hotel
is not a random name.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.731
Gelem means something specific
in the Roma language.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:39.573
Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem"
is the title of the Romani hymn,

00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:42.275
the official, and it means
"I went a long way."

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.199
BG: That's just to add
the detail to your talk.

00:11:45.223 --> 00:11:47.907
But you two traveled
to the island of Lesbos

00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.622
very recently, you're just back
a couple of days ago,

00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:53.054
in Greece, where thousands
of refugees are arriving

00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:55.366
and have been arriving
over the last few months.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.832
What did you see there
and what did you do there?

00:11:57.856 --> 00:12:01.657
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one
of the Greek islands close to Turkey,

00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:03.076
and during our stay,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.521
many asylum seekers arrived by boat
on overcrowded dinghies,

00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:12.204
and after landing, they were left
completely on their own.

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:16.019
They are denied many services.

00:12:16.043 --> 00:12:18.537
For example, they are not allowed
to buy a bus ticket

00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:19.966
or to rent a hotel room,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.676
so many families literally
sleep in the streets.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.336
And we installed networks there
to allow basic communication,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.463
because I think, I believe,

00:12:31.487 --> 00:12:36.926
it's not only that we have to speak
about the refugees,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.275
I think we need to start talking to them.

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:44.275
And by doing so, we can realize
that it is about human beings,

00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:47.062
about their lives
and their struggle to survive.

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.996
BG: And allow them to talk as well.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.935
Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:53.977
Mathias, thank you for coming to TED
and sharing your story.

00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:56.132
(Applause)
