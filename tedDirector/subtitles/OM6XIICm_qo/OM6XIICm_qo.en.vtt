00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Time flies.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
It's actually almost 20 years ago

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
Now, 20 years on, at TED,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
I want to ask your help in a new reframing.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.330
So going back to 1989,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
as a sort of a play project,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And so he gave me the time to code it up.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.330
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
hypertext protocol, HTTP;

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
the idea of URLs, these names for things

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
which started with HTTP.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
I wrote the code and put it out there.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Why did I do it?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Well, it was basically frustration.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
in this huge, very exciting lab,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
lots of people coming from all over the world.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
They had all sorts of different data formats,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
So that, in all that diversity,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
if I wanted to figure out how to build something

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
out of a bit of this and a bit of this,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
I had to learn to run some new program,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.330
I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
And these were all incompatible.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
It was just very frustrating.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
So if you just imagined them all

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.330
being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
say on the Internet,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
then life would be so much easier.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
and even if people don't read your memo --

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
(Laughter)

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
what the web was like.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
a page which has got links,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
Not impressive.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
so, imagine that that link could have gone

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
to virtually any document you could imagine.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Well, some people did.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.330
And that is what has made it most fun.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
That has been the most exciting thing,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
not the technology, not the things people have done with it,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
but actually the community, the spirit of all these people

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
getting together, sending the emails.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
That's what it was like then.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
And you did.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Thanks.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
It's been a blast, hasn't it?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
I mean, it has been quite interesting

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
because we've found out that the things that happen with the web

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
really sort of blow us away.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
They're much more than we'd originally imagined

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
when we put together the little, initial website

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
that we started off with.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
There is still a huge frustration

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Well, documents you read, OK?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.330
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
one of the great TED Talks.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Hans put up this presentation

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.330
in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
he showed income levels on one axis

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.330
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
which just shattered a lot of myths that people had

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
about the economics in the developing world.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
He put up a slide a little bit like this.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
It had underground all the data

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
Because data you can't naturally use by itself

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
In this case, Hans had put the data together

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.330
he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
He had put it together,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.330
and then he'd put it into this software,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
which I think his son developed, originally,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
and produces this wonderful presentation.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
And Hans made a point

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
And I was happy to see that at the party last night

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
So I want us now to think about

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.330
not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.330
but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
and then calling that linked data.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
first thing is that those HTTP names --

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
those things that start with "http:" --

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
we're using them not just for documents now,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
we're using them for things that the documents are about.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
We're using them for people, we're using them for places,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
using the HTTP protocol from the web,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
I will get back some data in a standard format

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.330
which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
about that thing, about that event.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
where they were born, things like that.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
So the second rule is I get important information back.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Third rule is that when I get back that information

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
it's got relationships.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Data is relationships.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
Interestingly, data is relationships.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
then the other thing that it's related to

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.330
is given one of those names that starts HTTP.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
and the population of it, and so on.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
So I can browse this stuff.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
So that's it, really.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
That is linked data.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and soon after that, things started to happen.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.330
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
of these boxes that Hans had,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
It's not just a root supplying a plant,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
but for each of those plants, whatever it is --

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
they get to look at all the data

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
and they get it connected together,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
and the really important thing about data

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
So, linked data.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
The meme went out there.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
he noticed that Wikipedia --

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
And in most information boxes, there's data.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
and put it into a blob of linked data

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
on the web, which he called dbpedia.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
and if you actually go and look up Berlin,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
you'll find that there are other blobs of data

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Let's think about data for a bit.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
there's scientific data, there's personal data,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
there's weather data, there's data about events,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.330
there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
I'm just going to mention a few of them

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
so that you also see how much unlocked potential.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Let's start with government data.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
Barack Obama said in a speech,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.330
that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
in accessible formats.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
That's important. Why is it important?

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.330
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
It's actual useful. It's got value.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
I can use it in my company.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
by making this data available.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
in a government department, often you find that

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
these people, they're very tempted to keep it --

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
Hans calls it database hugging.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
until you've made a beautiful website for it.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
yes, make a beautiful website,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Make a beautiful website, but first

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
give us the unadulterated data,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
we want the data.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
We want unadulterated data.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Can you say "raw"?

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.330
Audience: Raw.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.330
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.330
Audience: Data.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.330
TBL: Can you say "now"?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.330
Audience: Now!

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
Audience: Raw data now!

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.330
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
people come up with to hang onto their data

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.330
and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.330
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.330
of the huge challenges that human society has right now --

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
understanding how the world works.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
they have half-formed ideas in their head,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
they try to communicate those over the web.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
is on databases, often sitting in their computers,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and actually, currently not shared.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
In fact, I'll just go into one area --

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
because scientists in that field realize

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
this is a great way of getting out of those silos,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
because they had their genomics data in one database

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
in one building, and they had their protein data in another.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
I wouldn't ask -- they would.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
What proteins are involved in signal transduction

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
and also related to pyramidal neurons?

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
because nobody has asked that question before.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
You get 223,000 hits --

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
no results you can use.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.330
32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
and you can look at.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
is really a complete sea change.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
It's very very important.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.330
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and has nothing to do with you.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
But, that's not true.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
In fact, data is about our lives.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Bing! Relationship. Data.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
Every time you do things on the social networking site,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
But, when you go to another linked data site --

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and let's say this is one about travel,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
you can't get over the walls.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.330
tremendous frustration.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
between social networking sites.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
We need to do that with linked data.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.330
I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
I did that. Me!

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
I did that to the map. I just did that!

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
and it creates an incredible resource

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.330
because everybody else does theirs.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
And that is what linked data is all about.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
It's about people doing their bit

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.330
to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.330
That's how linked data works.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.330
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
but you know to demand it.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
And we've practiced that.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
So, linked data -- it's huge.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
I've only told you a very small number of things

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
There are data in every aspect of our lives,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
every aspect of work and pleasure,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
it's about connecting it together.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
And when you connect data together, you get power

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.330
You get this really huge power out of it.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
So, we're at the stage now

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.330
where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.330
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
even though there's not an immediate return on the investment

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.330
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
which would be good if everybody else did them.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
OK, so it's called linked data.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
I want you to make it.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
I want you to demand it.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.330
Thanks.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.330
(Applause)
