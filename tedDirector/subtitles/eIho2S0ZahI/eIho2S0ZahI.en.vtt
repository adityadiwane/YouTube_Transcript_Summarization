00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.046
The human voice:

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.634
It's the instrument we all play.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.069
It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.916
It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you."

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.798
And yet many people have the experience

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:28.186
that when they speak, people
don't listen to them.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.322
And why is that?

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:33.112
How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world?

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:34.797
What I'd like to suggest,

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:37.666
there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.420
I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking.

00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:43.852
I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list,

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:49.108
but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.139
First, gossip.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.097
Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.796
Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.700
the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us.

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.491
Second, judging.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.899
We know people who are like this
in conversation,

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:07.855
and it's very hard to listen to somebody

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:12.005
if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time.

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:13.905
Third, negativity.

00:01:14.447 --> 00:01:15.735
You can fall into this.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.796
My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.142
and it's hard to listen.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.899
I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today,"

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:25.016
and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.238
(Laughter)

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:29.611
It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:30.907
(Laughter)

00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.451
And another form
of negativity, complaining.

00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:37.518
Well, this is the national art of the U.K.

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:38.953
It's our national sport.

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:42.411
We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.531
but actually, complaining is viral misery.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.187
It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world.

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:50.024
Excuses.

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.372
We've all met this guy.

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:52.972
Maybe we've all been this guy.

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:55.466
Some people have a blamethrower.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.694
They just pass it on to everybody else

00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:00.022
and don't take responsibility
for their actions,

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:02.958
and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that.

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:04.780
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:08.186
embroidery, exaggeration.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.614
It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes.

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:13.906
For example, if I see something
that really is awesome,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.196
what do I call it?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.816
(Laughter)

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.276
And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.299
and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us.

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:26.563
And finally, dogmatism.

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:31.299
The confusion of facts with opinions.

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:33.238
When those two things get conflated,

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:34.739
you're listening into the wind.

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:38.430
You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true.

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:40.523
It's difficult to listen to that.

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:43.564
So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking.

00:02:43.588 --> 00:02:45.997
These are things I think we need to avoid.

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.866
But is there a positive
way to think about this?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.149
Yes, there is.

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:55.950
I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations,

00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:58.396
that we can stand on if we want our speech

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.631
to be powerful and to make
change in the world.

00:03:02.288 --> 00:03:04.499
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

00:03:04.523 --> 00:03:07.595
The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well.

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.263
I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:11.551
and hits you on the head.

00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:13.195
I'm talking about this definition,

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.016
to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.283
which is how I think
our words will be received

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:18.879
if we stand on these four things.

00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:20.401
So what do they stand for?

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:21.801
See if you can guess.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.259
The H, honesty, of course,

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:28.230
being true in what you say,
being straight and clear.

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:32.271
The A is authenticity,
just being yourself.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.481
A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth,

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:37.419
which I think is a lovely way to put it.

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:40.055
The I is integrity, being your word,

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.843
actually doing what you say,

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:43.697
and being somebody people can trust.

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:46.355
And the L is love.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.227
I don't mean romantic love,

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.636
but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.050
First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want.

00:03:56.074 --> 00:03:58.639
I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning.

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:01.997
Perhaps that's not necessary.

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.355
Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.450
But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well,

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:11.087
it's very hard to judge
them at the same time.

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:14.673
I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.886
So hail.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.643
Also, now that's what you say,

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.911
and it's like the old song,
it is what you say,

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:22.614
it's also the way that you say it.

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:24.386
You have an amazing toolbox.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.246
This instrument is incredible,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.786
and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.407
I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now

00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:33.831
and just pull a few tools out

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.094
that you might like to take
away and play with,

00:04:36.118 --> 00:04:38.418
which will increase
the power of your speaking.

00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:39.962
Register, for example.

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:44.156
Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.210
but there's a register in between.

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:48.395
I'm not going to get very
technical about this

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.181
for any of you who are voice coaches.

00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:51.918
You can locate your voice, however.

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:54.800
So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference.

00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:56.308
If I go down here in my throat,

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:58.961
which is where most of us
speak from most of the time.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:00.618
But if you want weight,

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:03.096
you need to go down here to the chest.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.706
You hear the difference?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.746
We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.714
because we associate depth with power

00:05:11.738 --> 00:05:13.500
and with authority.

00:05:14.445 --> 00:05:15.812
That's register.

00:05:16.134 --> 00:05:17.477
Then we have timbre.

00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.246
It's the way your voice feels.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.602
Again, the research shows

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:24.400
that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm,

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.910
like hot chocolate.

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:29.899
Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world,

00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:31.341
because you can train.

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:32.585
Go and get a voice coach.

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:34.467
And there are amazing things you can do

00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:36.897
with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:39.411
to improve the timbre of your voice.

00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:41.203
Then prosody. I love prosody.

00:05:41.227 --> 00:05:43.379
This is the sing-song, the meta-language

00:05:43.403 --> 00:05:45.453
that we use in order to impart meaning.

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:48.291
It's root one for meaning in conversation.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:52.371
People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:54.587
if they don't have any prosody at all.

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.562
That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from,

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.523
or monotonous, monotone.

00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:03.579
Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in,

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:06.299
where every sentence ends
as if it were a question

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:08.800
when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement?

00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:11.130
(Laughter)

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:12.716
And if you repeat that one,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.084
it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody,

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:17.970
which I think is a shame,

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.979
so let's try and break that habit.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.394
Pace.

00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:25.179
I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly,

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:28.555
or I can slow right down to emphasize,

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:32.195
and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence.

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:37.695
There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there?

00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:41.000
We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.063
It can be very powerful.

00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:46.127
Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:48.771
to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch.

00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:50.359
Where did you leave my keys?

00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:52.463
(Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys?

00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:56.132
So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries.

00:06:56.156 --> 00:06:58.378
And finally, volume.

00:06:58.402 --> 00:07:01.779
(Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume.

00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:03.956
Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.503
Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet.

00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:10.503
Some people broadcast the whole time.

00:07:10.527 --> 00:07:11.876
Try not to do that.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.728
That's called sodcasting,

00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:15.421
(Laughter)

00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:19.989
Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately.

00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:21.091
Not nice.

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:23.647
Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all

00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:26.175
is when you've got something
really important to do.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.627
It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people.

00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:31.515
It might be proposing marriage,

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.669
asking for a raise, a wedding speech.

00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:36.675
Whatever it is, if it's really important,

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.448
you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox

00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:42.485
and the engine that it's going to work on,

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.580
and no engine works well
without being warmed up.

00:07:45.604 --> 00:07:47.073
Warm up your voice.

00:07:47.482 --> 00:07:49.533
Actually, let me show you how to do that.

00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:52.512
Would you all like to stand
up for a moment?

00:07:52.536 --> 00:07:53.667
I'm going to show you

00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:58.901
the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do.

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:01.835
Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these.

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:04.638
First, arms up, deep breath in,

00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:07.740
and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.

00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:09.368
One more time.

00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:12.366
Ahhhh, very good.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.108
Now we're going to warm up our lips,

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:16.460
and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:19.412
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.

00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:22.852
And now, brrrrrrrrrr,

00:08:22.876 --> 00:08:24.402
just like when you were a kid.

00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:26.829
Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive.

00:08:26.853 --> 00:08:28.504
We're going to do the tongue next

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:32.826
with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.041
Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this.

00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:37.931
And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:40.147
That's like champagne for the tongue.

00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.467
Finally, and if I can only do one,

00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:44.274
the pros call this the siren.

00:08:44.298 --> 00:08:46.918
It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw."

00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:48.562
The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.

00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:54.682
So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.945
Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.214
Take a seat, thank you.

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.688
(Applause)

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:02.312
Next time you speak, do those in advance.

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:04.952
Now let me just put this
in context to close.

00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:07.248
This is a serious point here.

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:09.079
This is where we are now, right?

00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:10.744
We speak not very well

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.612
to people who simply aren't listening

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:15.531
in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.774
I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases.

00:09:18.798 --> 00:09:20.408
What would the world be like

00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:22.128
if we were speaking powerfully

00:09:22.152 --> 00:09:24.184
to people who were listening consciously

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:27.578
in environments which were
actually fit for purpose?

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:30.561
Or to make that a bit larger,

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:31.919
what would the world be like

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.286
if we were creating sound consciously

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.319
and consuming sound consciously

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.046
and designing all our environments

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.523
consciously for sound?

00:09:39.547 --> 00:09:42.647
That would be a world
that does sound beautiful,

00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:46.558
and one where understanding
would be the norm,

00:09:46.582 --> 00:09:49.231
and that is an idea worth spreading.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.387
Thank you.

00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:51.933
(Applause)
