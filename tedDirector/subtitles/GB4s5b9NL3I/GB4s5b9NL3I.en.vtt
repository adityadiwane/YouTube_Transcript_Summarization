00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.400
Democracy.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.296
In the West,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.256
we make a colossal mistake
taking it for granted.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.576
We see democracy

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.096
not as the most fragile
of flowers that it really is,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.960
but we see it as part
of our society's furniture.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.960
We tend to think of it
as an intransigent given.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.896
We mistakenly believe that capitalism
begets inevitably democracy.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.256
It doesn't.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.656
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
and his great imitators in Beijing

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.616
have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.536
that it is perfectly possible
to have a flourishing capitalism,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.160
spectacular growth,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.016
while politics remains democracy-free.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.456
Indeed, democracy is receding
in our neck of the woods,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.056
here in Europe.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.456
Earlier this year,
while I was representing Greece --

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.216
the newly elected Greek government --

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.936
in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.896
I was told in no uncertain terms
that our nation's democratic process --

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.336
our elections --

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.136
could not be allowed to interfere

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.400
with economic policies
that were being implemented in Greece.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.336
At that moment,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.656
I felt that there could be no greater
vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.216
or the Chinese Communist Party,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.976
indeed of some recalcitrant
friends of mine who kept telling me

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
that democracy would be banned
if it ever threatened to change anything.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.896
Tonight, here, I want to present to you

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.080
an economic case
for an authentic democracy.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.456
I want to ask you
to join me in believing again

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
that Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.856
the Chinese Communist Party

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.256
and indeed the Eurogroup

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.920
are wrong in believing
that we can dispense with democracy --

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.336
that we need an authentic,
boisterous democracy.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.336
And without democracy,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.216
our societies will be nastier,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.376
our future bleak

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.216
and our great, new technologies wasted.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.496
Speaking of waste,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.295
allow me to point out
an interesting paradox

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.096
that is threatening
our economies as we speak.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.416
I call it the twin peaks paradox.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.736
One peak you understand --

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.376
you know it, you recognize it --

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.456
is the mountain of debts
that has been casting a long shadow

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.296
over the United States,
Europe, the whole world.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.200
We all recognize the mountain of debts.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.000
But few people discern its twin.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.840
A mountain of idle cash

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.200
belonging to rich savers
and to corporations,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.696
too terrified to invest it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.016
into the productive activities
that can generate the incomes

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.096
from which you can extinguish
the mountain of debts

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.096
and which can produce all those things
that humanity desperately needs,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.776
like green energy.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.136
Now let me give you two numbers.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.496
Over the last three months,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.296
in the United States,
in Britain and in the Eurozone,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.736
we have invested, collectively,
3.4 trillion dollars

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.416
on all the wealth-producing goods --

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.456
things like industrial plants, machinery,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.696
office blocks, schools,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.856
roads, railways, machinery,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.616
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.496
until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.216
that has been slushing around
in the same countries,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.056
in our financial institutions,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.280
doing absolutely nothing
during the same period

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.296
except inflating stock exchanges
and bidding up house prices.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.576
So a mountain of debt
and a mountain of idle cash

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.296
form twin peaks, 
failing to cancel each other out

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.136
through the normal
operation of the markets.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.480
The result is stagnant wages,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.016
more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds
in America, in Japan and in Europe

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.536
out of work.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.896
And consequently, low aggregate demand,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.136
which in a never-ending cycle,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.880
reinforces the pessimism of the investors,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.696
who, fearing low demand,
reproduce it by not investing --

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.416
exactly like Oedipus' father,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.935
who, terrified
by the prophecy of the oracle

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.696
that his son would grow up to kill him,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.656
unwittingly engineered the conditions

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
that ensured that Oedipus,
his son, would kill him.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560
This is my quarrel with capitalism.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.216
Its gross wastefulness,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.856
all this idle cash,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.976
should be energized to improve lives,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.336
to develop human talents,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.216
and indeed to finance
all these technologies,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.496
green technologies,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.280
which are absolutely essential
for saving planet Earth.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.536
Am I right in believing
that democracy might be the answer?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.776
I believe so,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.016
but before we move on,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440
what do we mean by democracy?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.936
Aristotle defined democracy

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.896
as the constitution
in which the free and the poor,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.080
being in the majority, control government.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.296
Now, of course Athenian democracy
excluded too many.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.360
Women, migrants and,
of course, the slaves.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.296
But it would be a mistake

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.896
to dismiss the significance
of ancient Athenian democracy

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
on the basis of whom it excluded.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.936
What was more pertinent,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.816
and continues to be so
about ancient Athenian democracy,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.336
was the inclusion of the working poor,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.056
who not only acquired
the right to free speech,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.336
but more importantly, crucially,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.976
they acquired the rights
to political judgments

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.376
that were afforded equal weight

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.056
in the decision-making
concerning matters of state.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.136
Now, of course, Athenian
democracy didn't last long.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.576
Like a candle that burns brightly,
it burned out quickly.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.816
And indeed,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.096
our liberal democracies today
do not have their roots in ancient Athens.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.456
They have their roots in the Magna Carta,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.736
in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.976
indeed in the American constitution.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.016
Whereas Athenian democracy
was focusing on the masterless citizen

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.320
and empowering the working poor,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.416
our liberal democracies are founded
on the Magna Carta tradition,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.536
which was, after all,
a charter for masters.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.856
And indeed, liberal democracy
only surfaced when it was possible

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.736
to separate fully the political sphere
from the economic sphere,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.816
so as to confine the democratic process
fully in the political sphere,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.696
leaving the economic sphere --

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.656
the corporate world, if you want --

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.360
as a democracy-free zone.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.696
Now, in our democracies today,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.216
this separation of the economic
from the political sphere,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.496
the moment it started happening,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.816
it gave rise to an inexorable,
epic struggle between the two,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.056
with the economic sphere
colonizing the political sphere,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.600
eating into its power.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.880
Have you wondered why politicians
are not what they used to be?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.976
It's not because their DNA
has degenerated.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.616
(Laughter)

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.256
It is rather because one can be
in government today and not in power,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.576
because power has migrated
from the political to the economic sphere,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.840
which is separate.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.736
Indeed,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.056
I spoke about my quarrel
with capitalism.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.816
If you think about it,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.160
it is a little bit like
a population of predators,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.800
that are so successful in decimating
the prey that they must feed on,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.696
that in the end they starve.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.936
Similarly,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.656
the economic sphere has been colonizing
and cannibalizing the political sphere

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.056
to such an extent
that it is undermining itself,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.816
causing economic crisis.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.936
Corporate power is increasing,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.176
political goods are devaluing,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.016
inequality is rising,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.616
aggregate demand is falling

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.760
and CEOs of corporations are too scared
to invest the cash of their corporations.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.176
So the more capitalism succeeds
in taking the demos out of democracy,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.536
the taller the twin peaks

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.096
and the greater the waste
of human resources

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.560
and humanity's wealth.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.496
Clearly, if this is right,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.576
we must reunite the political
and economic spheres

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.096
and better do it
with a demos being in control,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.056
like in ancient Athens
except without the slaves

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.040
or the exclusion of women and migrants.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.856
Now, this is not an original idea.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.655
The Marxist left
had that idea 100 years ago

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.360
and it didn't go very well, did it?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.256
The lesson that we learned
from the Soviet debacle

00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:00.616
is that only by a miracle
will the working poor be reempowered,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.616
as they were in ancient Athens,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.400
without creating new forms
of brutality and waste.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.200
But there is a solution:

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.720
eliminate the working poor.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.616
Capitalism's doing it

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.520
by replacing low-wage workers
with automata, androids, robots.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.296
The problem is

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.536
that as long as the economic
and the political spheres are separate,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.880
automation makes the twin peaks taller,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.376
the waste loftier

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.456
and the social conflicts deeper,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.680
including --

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.856
soon, I believe --

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.480
in places like China.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.136
So we need to reconfigure,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.816
we need to reunite the economic
and the political spheres,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.216
but we'd better do it
by democratizing the reunified sphere,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.936
lest we end up with
a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.976
that makes The Matrix, the movie,
look like a documentary.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.576
(Laughter)

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.016
So the question is not
whether capitalism will survive

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.360
the technological innovations
it is spawning.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.576
The more interesting question

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.336
is whether capitalism will be succeeded
by something resembling a Matrix dystopia

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.776
or something much closer
to a Star Trek-like society,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.176
where machines serve the humans

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.616
and the humans expend their energies
exploring the universe

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.936
and indulging in long debates
about the meaning of life

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.960
in some ancient, Athenian-like,
high tech agora.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.800
I think we can afford to be optimistic.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.696
But what would it take,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.696
what would it look like

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.600
to have this Star Trek-like utopia,
instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.496
In practical terms,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.256
allow me to share just briefly,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.480
a couple of examples.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.856
At the level of the enterprise,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.216
imagine a capital market,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.920
where you earn capital as you work,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.216
and where your capital follows you
from one job to another,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.736
from one company to another,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.016
and the company --

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.496
whichever one you happen
to work at at that time --

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.840
is solely owned by those who happen
to work in it at that moment.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.096
Then all income stems
from capital, from profits,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.496
and the very concept
of wage labor becomes obsolete.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:35.136
No more separation between those
who own but do not work in the company

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.416
and those who work
but do not own the company;

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.640
no more tug-of-war
between capital and labor;

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.576
no great gap between
investment and saving;

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.840
indeed, no towering twin peaks.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.976
At the level of the global
political economy,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.936
imagine for a moment

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.936
that our national currencies
have a free-floating exchange rate,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.736
with a universal,
global, digital currency,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.776
one that is issued
by the International Monetary Fund,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.016
the G-20,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.576
on behalf of all humanity.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.816
And imagine further

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.176
that all international trade
is denominated in this currency --

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.016
let's call it "the cosmos,"

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.440
in units of cosmos --

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.096
with every government agreeing
to be paying into a common fund

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.656
a sum of cosmos units proportional
to the country's trade deficit,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.080
or indeed to a country's trade surplus.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.936
And imagine that that fund is utilized
to invest in green technologies,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.280
especially in parts of the world
where investment funding is scarce.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.416
This is not a new idea.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.776
It's what, effectively,
John Maynard Keynes proposed

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.120
in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.296
The problem is

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.616
that back then, they didn't have
the technology to implement it.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.856
Now we do,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.800
especially in the context
of a reunified political-economic sphere.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.056
The world that I am describing to you

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.536
is simultaneously libertarian,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.136
in that it prioritizes
empowered individuals,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.376
Marxist,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.616
since it will have confined
to the dustbin of history

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.096
the division between capital and labor,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.680
and Keynesian,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.800
global Keynesian.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.896
But above all else,

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.840
it is a world in which we will be able
to imagine an authentic democracy.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.520
Will such a world dawn?

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.896
Or shall we descend
into a Matrix-like dystopia?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.040
The answer lies in the political choice
that we shall be making collectively.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.336
It is our choice,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.680
and we'd better make it democratically.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.536
Thank you.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.920
(Applause)

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.680
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.320
It was you who described yourself
in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.920
What is the relevance
of Marx's analysis today?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.336
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was
any relevance in what I just said,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.576
then Marx is relevant.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.096
Because the whole point of reunifying
the political and economic is --

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.336
if we don't do it,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.616
then technological innovation
is going to create

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.936
such a massive fall in aggregate demand,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.736
what Larry Summers
refers to as secular stagnation.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.616
With this crisis migrating
from one part of the world,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.176
as it is now,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.896
it will destabilize
not only our democracies,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.136
but even the emerging world that is not
that keen on liberal democracy.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.976
So if this analysis holds water,
then Marx is absolutely relevant.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.736
But so is Hayek,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.576
that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.816
and so is Keynes,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.736
so that's why I'm totally confused.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.976
(Laughter)

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.056
BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.376
(Laughter)

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.376
(Applause)

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.176
YV: If you are not confused,
you are not thinking, OK?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.296
BG: That's a very, very Greek
philosopher kind of thing to say --

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.976
YV: That was Einstein, actually --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.616
BG: During your talk
you mentioned Singapore and China,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.696
and last night at the speaker dinner,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.896
you expressed a pretty strong opinion
about how the West looks at China.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.496
Would you like to share that?

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.680
YV: Well, there's a great
degree of hypocrisy.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.696
In our liberal democracies,
we have a semblance of democracy.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.456
It's because we have confined,
as I was saying in my talk,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.136
democracy to the political sphere,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.616
while leaving the one sphere
where all the action is --

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.856
the economic sphere --

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.720
a completely democracy-free zone.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.536
In a sense,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.760
if I am allowed to be provocative,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.296
China today is closer to Britain
in the 19th century.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.576
Because remember,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.936
we tend to associate
liberalism with democracy --

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.456
that's a mistake, historically.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.016
Liberalism, liberal,
it's like John Stuart Mill.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.736
John Stuart Mill was particularly
skeptical about the democratic process.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.136
So what you are seeing now in China
is a very similar process

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.336
to the one that we had in Britain
during the Industrial Revolution,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.336
especially the transition
from the first to the second.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.656
And to be castigating China

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.816
for doing that which the West did
in the 19th century,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.160
smacks of hypocrisy.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.176
BG: I am sure that many people here
are wondering about your experience

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.936
as the Finance Minister of Greece
earlier this year.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.341
YV: I knew this was coming.

00:16:29.365 --> 00:16:30.616
BG: Yes.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.976
BG: Six months after,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.400
how do you look back
at the first half of the year?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.536
YV: Extremely exciting,
from a personal point of view,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.816
and very disappointing,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.736
because we had an opportunity
to reboot the Eurozone.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.856
Not just Greece, the Eurozone.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.816
To move away from the complacency

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.296
and the constant denial
that there was a massive --

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.176
and there is a massive
architectural fault line

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.376
going through the Eurozone,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.816
which is threatening, massively,
the whole of the European Union process.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.016
We had an opportunity
on the basis of the Greek program --

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.376
which by the way,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.776
was the first program
to manifest that denial --

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.016
to put it right.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.256
And, unfortunately,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.096
the powers in the Eurozone,

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.320
in the Eurogroup,

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.056
chose to maintain denial.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.336
But you know what happens.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.415
This is the experience
of the Soviet Union.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.935
When you try to keep alive

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.839
an economic system
that architecturally cannot survive,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.175
through political will
and through authoritarianism,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.856
you may succeed in prolonging it,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.455
but when change happens

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.976
it happens very abruptly
and catastrophically.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.007
BG: What kind of change
are you foreseeing?

00:17:39.031 --> 00:17:40.285
YV: Well, there's no doubt

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.976
that if we don't change
the architecture of the Eurozone,

00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:44.895
the Eurozone has no future.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.816
BG: Did you make any mistakes
when you were Finance Minister?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.056
YV: Every day.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.616
BG: For example?
YV: Anybody who looks back --

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.720
(Applause)

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.496
No, but seriously.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.096
If there's any Minister of Finance,
or of anything else for that matter,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.336
who tells you after six months in a job,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.056
especially in such a stressful situation,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.776
that they have made no mistake,
they're dangerous people.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.096
Of course I made mistakes.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.936
The greatest mistake
was to sign the application

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.056
for the extension of a loan agreement

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.696
in the end of February.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.936
I was imagining

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.936
that there was a genuine interest
on the side of the creditors

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.216
to find common ground.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.456
And there wasn't.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.096
They were simply interested
in crushing our government,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.576
just because they did not want

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.736
to have to deal with
the architectural fault lines

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.776
that were running through the Eurozone.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.616
And because they didn't want to admit

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.256
that for five years they were implementing
a catastrophic program in Greece.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.176
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.136
This is worse than the Great Depression.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.416
And no one has come clean

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.376
from the troika of lenders
that have been imposing this policy

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.376
to say, "This was a colossal mistake."

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.616
BG: Despite all this,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.976
and despite the aggressiveness
of the discussion,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.416
you seem to be remaining
quite pro-European.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.656
YV: Absolutely.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.816
Look, my criticism
of the European Union and the Eurozone

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.880
comes from a person
who lives and breathes Europe.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.256
My greatest fear is that
the Eurozone will not survive.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.736
Because if it doesn't,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.616
the centrifugal forces
that will be unleashed

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.336
will be demonic,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.336
and they will destroy the European Union.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.776
And that will be catastrophic
not just for Europe

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.416
but for the whole global economy.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.536
We are probably the largest
economy in the world.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.296
And if we allow ourselves

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.136
to fall into a route
of the postmodern 1930's,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.816
which seems to me to be what we are doing,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.656
then that will be detrimental

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.096
to the future of Europeans
and non-Europeans alike.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.536
BG: We definitely hope
you are wrong on that point.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.256
Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.496
YV: Thank you.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.343
(Applause)
