00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:18.308
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:20.351
for staying ahead of the reality curve,

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.266
to make possible today

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.348
what science will make a reality tomorrow.

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:28.349
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.308
and science to give us a feel of how future technologies

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.355
might be experienced.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:39.260
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.287
It's new technology. You look through them

00:00:41.287 --> 00:00:44.260
and the world you see is augmented with data:

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.317
names of places, monuments, buildings,

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:51.333
maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.349
So these are my illusion glasses.

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:59.304
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:02.310
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.318
into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.

00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:08.343
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:13.324
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.

00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:17.334
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:22.322
when we see it again.

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:26.272
All right. Very significant mark.

00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:28.272
And let's put it back into the deck,

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:33.266
somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.296
(Music)

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:37.273
Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.

00:01:37.273 --> 00:01:39.302
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,

00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:43.271
a deck of cards is made up of four different suits:

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:46.272
hearts, clubs,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.293
diamonds and spades.

00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:52.283
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:57.287
and have been interpreted in many different ways.

00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:01.275
Now, some say that the four suits

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:05.277
represent the four seasons.

00:02:05.277 --> 00:02:08.347
There's spring, summer,

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:11.274
autumn and â€”

00:02:11.274 --> 00:02:14.268
Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:17.285
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.356
when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:24.330
and then it all disappears.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.353
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:34.310
Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.268
MT: So over here is low tide,

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:39.338
and over here is high tide,

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:42.326
and in the middle is the moon.

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:46.286
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:50.351
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.342
There is the color red

00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:58.279
and the color black,

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.278
representing the constant change

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.278
from day to night.

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:06.319
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.356
MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:15.359
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.293
(Music)

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:21.331
Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.265
the result is 365.

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:27.309
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
the number of days between

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.344
each birthday.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:36.300
Make a wish. (Blowing noise)

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.344
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.

00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:41.303
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:44.347
that I received my first deck of cards,

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:49.287
and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:52.343
performing magic for boys and girls,

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:55.290
men and women, husbands and wives,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.315
even kings and queens. (Applause)

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:05.309
Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.318
Wake up.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.310
Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.333
Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:14.340
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.274
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:23.334
MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:26.354
I'm performing for you.

00:04:26.354 --> 00:04:29.352
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:34.281
how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:37.287
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:41.333
I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.273
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration,

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:48.325
but it does take practice. Now, some people will say,

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:53.296
well, magic, that must be the work of some evil

00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:56.304
supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:59.282
(Music)

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:04.275
Whoa.

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:08.261
Well, to this, I just say, no no.

00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.350
Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.301
Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:18.267
if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.280
don't play for money.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.313
(Music)

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:28.264
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.

00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:31.342
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.

00:05:31.342 --> 00:05:36.284
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.

00:05:36.284 --> 00:05:41.281
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,

00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:44.292
and most important card of all:

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:47.293
the one with this very significant mark on it.

00:05:47.293 --> 00:05:50.260
And unlike anything else we've just seen,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.281
virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.

00:05:54.281 --> 00:06:03.287
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:12.280
MT: Bye bye. (Music)

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.330
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.348
(Applause)

00:06:18.348 --> 00:06:25.317
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:29.317
(Applause)
