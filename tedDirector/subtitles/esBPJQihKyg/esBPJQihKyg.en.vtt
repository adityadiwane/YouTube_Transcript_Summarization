00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What I am always thinking about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but in the best sense of the word.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
how to live and how to die, period.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that keep you grounded.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My older sister was busy torturing my parents,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and they were busy torturing her.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
from beginning to end.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but he went to Cuba.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so I had more money than he did.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But, then he came back, and things happened,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I decided I really hated my writing,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that it was awful, awful, purple prose.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I decided that I wanted to tell --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but I still wanted to tell a narrative story

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I still wanted to tell my stories.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And so what happened was that I started

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And we started a studio.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don't know anything,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
because if you know too much, you're stymied.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So, the premise in the studio was,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
there are no boundaries, there is no fear.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that -- fortunately, there were enough people there,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and it was a team, it was a collective,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and clearly we also needed to make some money,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
so we decided we would create a series of products.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And some of the watches there,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
attempting to be beautiful and humorous --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That to be able to talk about content,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and we wanted to say, the content is what's important,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not the package, not the wrapping.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So, the good news is that I have a dog

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and, though I don't know if I believe in luck --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
because everybody's always, you know, leaving,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and he runs to the other room.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
from working for adults to children, and back and forth,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and in a way, that's true.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and finding out something new.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and you're not talking in such a way that you,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So, I hopefully am writing, you know,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
books that are good for children and for adults.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But the painting reflects --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the same kind of love of language.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And the books are really journals of my life.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I never -- I don't like plots.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I don't know what a plot means.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because my life is too random and too confused,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and I enjoy it that way.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But anyway, so we were in Venice,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and this is our room. And I had this dream

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that I was wearing this fantastic green gown,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and I was looking out the window,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and it was really a beautiful thing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and hopefully go on to something else.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The letter C had other things in it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and somebody said Bronxistan,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and somebody said Ferreristan,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and we came up with this New Yorker cover,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we were able to take the city

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Who are these people? What are these tribes?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They're not."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and that's kind of the beauty part.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I said, people should know about this book.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and what an intersection of like, you know,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I'd like to do something to this book.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And I took the examples that they gave,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and just did 56 paintings, basically.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And when you're dealing with grammar,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
which is, you know, incredibly dry,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and then you come to the rules and, you know,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Do you mind my asking a question?"

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and "could" is an August Sander subject.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that I really love very much.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
because I really adore singing,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and I think that music is the highest form of all art.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
who wrote nine songs using the text,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and we performed this fantastic evening of --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
in the main reading room of the New York Public Library,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which we hopefully will do some more.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, once a month for the last year,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but I know I can throw that around now. You know,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and then I talk about Spinoza.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
for everything, called eudaemonia.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I happen to know it for a fact.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in this fantastic, decrepit palace.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
when the Bolsheviks arrived.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Laughter)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You don't even know.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
leafing through a book and butterflies,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
imagine such displacement, such loss?"

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Too many pogroms.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
they went to Palestine and then America."

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
had no use for facts whatsoever.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Facts were actually banished from our home.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
this is the home that I grew up in, OK?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because she couldn't care less.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
(Laughter)

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
"The Impossibility of February"

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
is that February's a really wretched month in New York

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Well, not so awful.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
but the caption says he is dead."

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
maybe he's not dead.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There's consoling.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It is February and not lying is impossible."

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And I really spend a lot of time wondering,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
how much truth do we tell?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
How do we know when we are ourselves?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
are real stories, you know, are real sentences?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I'm going to quickly go through this.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
A quote by Bertrand Russell,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
all the noonday brightness of human genius

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
are destined to extinction.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So now, my friends, if that is true,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and it is true, what is the point?"

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
A complicated question.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And so, you know, I talk to my friends

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Oh my God, you know what?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
you know, could we have it for a second?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Do you have that?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:46.000
(Music)

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
every day of the year until she was about 85.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
because, you know, we're from Russia.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
(Laughter)

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
she said she would treasure it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
"When you met him, you knew it was him."

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And she said, "I knew it was he."

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
(Laughter)

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Gershwin died at the age of 38.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I don't want to talk about that now.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Laughter)

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And I would like to run it for them.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
which is really amazing, and left.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And then I go and have some tea.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
(Laughter)

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
That's actually Hy.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
give me a break," but I was wrong.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
(Applause)
