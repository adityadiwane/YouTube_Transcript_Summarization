00:00:16.497 --> 00:03:33.144
(Music)

00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:56.802
(Applause)

00:03:56.802 --> 00:04:08.358
(Applause)

00:04:08.358 --> 00:07:16.504
(Music)

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:37.647
(Applause)

00:07:41.047 --> 00:10:52.915
(Music)

00:10:52.915 --> 00:11:21.213
(Applause)

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:22.780
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.532
That's amazing.

00:11:24.532 --> 00:11:28.070
(Applause)

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.700
You just don't hear that every day.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.651
(Laughter)

00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.052
Usman, the official story is that

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:35.532
you learned to play the guitar

00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:37.515
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.

00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:40.687
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --

00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:42.983
That was the first thing I learned,

00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:45.614
and then I started progressing to other things.

00:11:45.614 --> 00:11:48.653
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,

00:11:48.653 --> 00:11:52.406
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.550
so then I started watching his videos,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.794
and it's very surreal right now to be --

00:11:57.794 --> 00:11:59.955
(Laughter)

00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:04.655
(Applause)

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:06.427
CA: Was that piece just now,

00:12:06.427 --> 00:12:09.617
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

00:12:09.617 --> 00:12:10.713
UR: I'd never learned it before,

00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:13.730
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.121
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:20.809
And it finally happened, so ...

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:22.261
(Laughter)

00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:23.713
CA: Preston, from your point of view,

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:25.577
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:28.425
How does it feel to see someone like this

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:33.125
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:35.474
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,

00:12:35.474 --> 00:12:38.769
and I feel really proud, really honored.

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:44.273
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.

00:12:44.273 --> 00:12:47.193
(Laughter)

00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:52.505
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.937
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?

00:12:54.937 --> 00:12:57.719
PR: We haven't prepared anything.

00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:02.033
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.

00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:05.594
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:13:05.594 --> 00:13:07.017
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:08.545
and we just see that, I just think --

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:11.361
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:13.273
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.

00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:16.705
(Applause)

00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:24.705
(Laughter)

00:13:30.589 --> 00:16:17.120
(Music)

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:31.817
(Applause)
