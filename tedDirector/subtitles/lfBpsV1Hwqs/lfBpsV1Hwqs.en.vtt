00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:20.362
I'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:24.566
I like special missions
and secret objectives.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.257
So here's my special mission
for this talk:

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:33.031
I'm going to try to increase the life span
of every single person in this room

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.218
by seven and a half minutes.

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:38.362
Literally, you will live seven
and a half minutes longer

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:39.837
than you would have otherwise,

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.567
just because you watched this talk.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:45.010
Some of you are looking
a little bit skeptical.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:46.750
That's okay, because check it out --

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:49.527
I have math to prove that it is possible.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:51.024
It won't make much sense now.

00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:52.360
I'll explain it all later,

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.623
just pay attention
to the number at the bottom:

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:57.923
+7.68245837 minutes.

00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:01.442
That will be my gift to you
if I'm successful in my mission.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.635
Now, you have a secret mission too.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.170
Your mission is to figure out
how you want to spend

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.234
your extra seven and a half minutes.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:12.806
And I think you should do
something unusual with them,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.360
because these are bonus minutes.

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:16.352
You weren't going to have them anyway.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:20.376
Now, because I'm a game designer,
you might be thinking to yourself,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.821
I know what she wants us to do
with those minutes,

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:24.972
she wants us to spend them playing games.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.458
Now this is a totally
reasonable assumption,

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:30.244
given that I have made quite
a habit of encouraging people

00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:31.890
to spend more time playing games.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.170
For example, in my first TED Talk,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:38.361
I did propose that we should spend
21 billion hours a week,

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:40.482
as a planet, playing video games.

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:43.869
Now, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.

00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:48.203
It's so much time, in fact,
that the number one unsolicited comment

00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:50.505
that I have heard from people
all over the world

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.386
since I gave that talk, is this:

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:56.696
Jane, games are great and all,
but on your deathbed,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.217
are you really going to wish you spent
more time playing Angry Birds?

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.241
(Laughter)

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.390
This idea is so pervasive --

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.308
that games are a waste of time
that we will come to regret --

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:08.481
that I hear it literally everywhere I go.

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:10.400
For example, true story:

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:11.764
Just a few weeks ago,

00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:15.114
this cab driver, upon finding out
that a friend and I were in town

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:17.027
for a game developers' conference,

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:20.122
turned around and said -- and I quote --

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:22.712
"I hate games. Waste of life.

00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:27.340
Imagine getting to the end of your life
and regretting all that time."

00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:30.589
Now, I want to take
this problem seriously.

00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:33.144
I want games to be
a force for good in the world.

00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:35.944
I don't want gamers to regret
the time they spent playing,

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.070
time that I encouraged them to spend.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.153
So I have been thinking about this
question a lot lately.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.516
When we're on our deathbeds,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.417
will we regret the time
we spent playing games?

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.650
Now, this may surprise you,
but it turns out

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:52.818
there is actually some scientific research
on this question.

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:54.091
It's true.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:55.706
Hospice workers,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.641
the people who take care of us
at the end of our lives,

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:03.442
recently issued a report
on the most frequently expressed regrets

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.175
that people say when they are
literally on their deathbeds.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.961
And that's what I want
to share with you today --

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:13.128
the top five regrets of the dying.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.112
Number one:

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.866
I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:22.116
Number two:

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.527
I wish I had stayed
in touch with my friends.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.737
Number three:

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.228
I wish I had let myself be happier.

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:34.169
Number four:

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:37.380
I wish I'd had the courage
to express my true self.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.529
And number five:

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.237
I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.266
instead of what others expected of me.

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.847
Now, as far as I know, no one ever
told one of the hospice workers,

00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:53.942
"I wish I'd spent more
time playing video games,"

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.546
but when I hear these top five
regrets of the dying,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.362
I can't help but hear
five deep human cravings

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:01.386
that games actually help us fulfill.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.081
For example, I wish
I hadn't worked so hard.

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:06.812
For many people, this means,
I wish I'd spent more time

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:09.525
with my family, with my kids
when they were growing up.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.698
Well, we know that playing games together
has tremendous family benefits.

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:17.120
A recent study from Brigham
Young University School of Family Life

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:21.367
reported that parents who spend more time
playing video games with their kids

00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:24.450
have much stronger
real-life relationships with them.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.662
"I wish I'd stayed in touch
with my friends."

00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:30.130
Hundreds of millions of people

00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:33.292
use social games like FarmVille
or Words With Friends

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.621
to stay in daily contact
with real-life friends and family.

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:40.113
A recent study from
the University of Michigan

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:46.397
showed that these games are incredibly
powerful relationship-management tools.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:50.669
They help us stay connected
with people in our social network

00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:52.789
that we would otherwise grow distant from,

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:54.614
if we weren't playing games together.

00:04:55.113 --> 00:04:56.906
"I wish I'd let myself be happier."

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.311
Well, here I can't help but think
of the groundbreaking clinical trials

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:03.239
recently conducted
at East Carolina University

00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:06.114
that showed that online games
can outperform

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:09.856
pharmaceuticals for treating
clinical anxiety and depression.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.387
Just 30 minutes of online game play a day

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:16.384
was enough to create
dramatic boosts in mood

00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:18.969
and long-term increases in happiness.

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.440
"I wish I'd had the courage
to express my true self."

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:27.098
Well, avatars are a way
to express our true selves,

00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:30.454
our most heroic, idealized
version of who we might become.

00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:34.096
You can see that in this alter ego
portrait by Robbie Cooper

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.226
of a gamer with his avatar.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.090
And Stanford University has been
doing research for five years now

00:05:40.114 --> 00:05:44.267
to document how playing a game
with an idealized avatar

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.061
changes how we think and act in real life,

00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:50.045
making us more courageous, more ambitious,

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.236
more committed to our goals.

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:55.804
"I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,

00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:57.634
and not what others expected of me."

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:58.940
Are games doing this yet?

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:02.440
I'm not sure, so I've left
a Super Mario question mark.

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:04.258
We're going to come back to this one.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:08.321
But in the meantime,
perhaps you're wondering,

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:11.280
who is this game designer
to be talking to us

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.727
about deathbed regrets?

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:16.473
And it's true, I've never
worked in a hospice,

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:18.626
I've never been on my deathbed.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.703
But recently I did spend
three months in bed, wanting to die.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:27.133
Really wanting to die.

00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:29.020
Now let me tell you that story.

00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:32.981
It started two years ago, when I hit
my head and got a concussion.

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:34.778
The concussion didn't heal properly,

00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:38.559
and after 30 days, I was left
with symptoms like nonstop headaches,

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.321
nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:44.309
My doctor told me that in order
to heal my brain,

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:45.357
I had to rest it.

00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.014
So I had to avoid everything
that triggered my symptoms.

00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:50.909
For me that meant no reading,
no writing, no video games,

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.989
no work or email, no running,
no alcohol, no caffeine.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:56.982
In other words -- and I think
you see where this is going --

00:06:57.006 --> 00:06:58.086
no reason to live.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.111
(Laughter)

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:00.976
Of course it's meant to be funny,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.894
but in all seriousness,
suicidal ideation is quite common

00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:06.563
with traumatic brain injuries.

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:10.076
It happens to one in three,
and it happened to me.

00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:15.076
My brain started telling me,
"Jane, you want to die."

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:18.157
It said, "You're never going
to get better."

00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:21.982
It said, "The pain will never end."

00:07:22.644 --> 00:07:26.802
And these voices became
so persistent and so persuasive

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:31.935
that I started to legitimately
fear for my life,

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:36.436
which is the time that I said
to myself after 34 days --

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.523
and I will never forget this moment --

00:07:38.547 --> 00:07:41.930
I said, "I am either going to kill myself

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:44.557
or I'm going to turn this into a game."

00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:45.726
Now, why a game?

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.854
I knew from researching the psychology
of games for more than a decade

00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:51.585
that when we play a game --

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:53.640
and this is
in the scientific literature --

00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:56.433
we tackle tough challenges
with more creativity,

00:07:56.457 --> 00:07:58.134
more determination, more optimism,

00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:00.706
and we're more likely
to reach out to others for help.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.749
I wanted to bring these gamer traits
to my real-life challenge,

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:05.769
so I created a role-playing recovery game

00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:07.677
called Jane the Concussion Slayer.

00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.495
Now this became my new secret identity,

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:13.919
and the first thing I did as a slayer
was call my twin sister --

00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:16.251
I have an identical
twin sister named Kelly --

00:08:16.275 --> 00:08:19.993
and tell her, "I'm playing
a game to heal my brain,

00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:21.640
and I want you to play with me."

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:25.486
This was an easier way to ask for help.

00:08:26.147 --> 00:08:28.385
She became my first ally in the game,

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.345
my husband Kiyash joined next,

00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:33.763
and together we identified
and battled the bad guys.

00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:36.875
Now this was anything
that could trigger my symptoms

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:38.963
and therefore slow down
the healing process,

00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:41.335
things like bright lights
and crowded spaces.

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:44.380
We also collected and activated power-ups.

00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:47.341
This was anything I could do
on even my worst day

00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:49.508
to feel just a little bit good,

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:51.436
just a little bit productive.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.153
Things like cuddling
my dog for 10 minutes,

00:08:54.177 --> 00:08:57.445
or getting out of bed and walking
around the block just once.

00:08:57.469 --> 00:08:59.209
Now the game was that simple:

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:02.367
Adopt a secret identity,
recruit your allies,

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:04.940
battle the bad guys,
activate the power-ups.

00:09:05.415 --> 00:09:07.375
But even with a game so simple,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.938
within just a couple days
of starting to play,

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.769
that fog of depression
and anxiety went away.

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:16.229
It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.

00:09:16.253 --> 00:09:18.741
Now it wasn't a miracle cure
for the headaches

00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.004
or the cognitive symptoms.

00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:21.745
That lasted for more than a year,

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.382
and it was the hardest year
of my life by far.

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.269
But even when I still had the symptoms,

00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:30.950
even while I was still in pain,
I stopped suffering.

00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:34.435
Now what happened next
with the game surprised me.

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:36.520
I put up some blog posts
and videos online,

00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:37.965
explaining how to play.

00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:40.520
But not everybody
has a concussion, obviously,

00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:42.776
not everyone wants to be "the slayer,"

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.116
so I renamed the game SuperBetter.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.706
And soon, I started hearing
from people all over the world

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.016
who were adopting
their own secret identity,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.341
recruiting their own allies,
and they were getting "super better,"

00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:58.247
facing challenges
like cancer and chronic pain,

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:00.580
depression and Crohn's disease.

00:10:00.604 --> 00:10:04.961
Even people were playing it
for terminal diagnoses like ALS.

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:08.604
And I could tell from their messages
and their videos

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:12.191
that the game was helping them
in the same ways that it helped me.

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:15.067
They talked about feeling
stronger and braver.

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:19.752
They talked about feeling better
understood by their friends and family.

00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:22.319
And they even talked
about feeling happier,

00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:24.423
even though they were in pain,

00:10:24.447 --> 00:10:27.814
even though they were tackling
the toughest challenge of their lives.

00:10:27.838 --> 00:10:31.699
Now at the time, I'm thinking
to myself, what is going on here?

00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:36.616
I mean, how could a game
so trivial intervene so powerfully

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.567
in such serious, and in some cases
life-and-death, circumstances?

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.362
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me,

00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:44.893
there's no way I would have
believed it was possible.

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:47.336
Well, it turns out
there's some science here, too.

00:10:48.401 --> 00:10:53.099
Some people get stronger and happier
after a traumatic event.

00:10:53.123 --> 00:10:54.916
And that's what was happening to us.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.061
The game was helping us experience

00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:00.215
what scientists call
post-traumatic growth,

00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:02.439
which is not something
we usually hear about.

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:05.328
We usually hear about
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:07.944
But scientists now know
that a traumatic event

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.834
doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:13.198
Instead, we can use it as a springboard

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:16.718
to unleash our best qualities
and lead happier lives.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:21.384
Here are the top five things that people
with post-traumatic growth say:

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:22.932
"My priorities have changed."

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:25.266
"I'm not afraid to do
what makes me happy."

00:11:25.813 --> 00:11:28.440
"I feel closer to my friends and family."

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:32.407
"I understand myself better.
I know who I really am now."

00:11:33.123 --> 00:11:36.214
"I have a new sense of meaning
and purpose in my life."

00:11:36.674 --> 00:11:39.690
"I'm better able to focus
on my goals and dreams."

00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:41.809
Now, does this sound familiar?

00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:46.065
It should, because the top five traits
of post-traumatic growth

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:51.579
are essentially the direct opposite
of the top five regrets of the dying.

00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:53.143
Now this is interesting, right?

00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:55.863
It seems that somehow, a traumatic event

00:11:55.887 --> 00:12:00.027
can unlock our ability to lead
a life with fewer regrets.

00:12:00.051 --> 00:12:01.347
But how does it work?

00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:03.892
How do you get from trauma to growth?

00:12:03.916 --> 00:12:06.667
Or better yet, is there a way
to get all the benefits

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:09.188
of post-traumatic growth
without the trauma,

00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:11.641
without having to hit
your head in the first place?

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.148
That would be good, right?

00:12:13.172 --> 00:12:15.547
I wanted to understand
the phenomenon better,

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:18.762
so I devoured the scientific literature,
and here's what I learned.

00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:21.979
There are four kinds
of strength, or resilience,

00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:25.119
that contribute to post-traumatic growth,

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:27.717
and there are scientifically
validated activities

00:12:27.741 --> 00:12:32.181
that you can do every day to build up
these four kinds of resilience,

00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:33.974
and you don't need a trauma to do it.

00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:36.584
I could tell you what these four
types of strength are,

00:12:36.608 --> 00:12:38.711
but I'd rather you
experience them firsthand.

00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:41.684
I'd rather we all start building them up
together right now.

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.139
Here's what we're going to do.

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:44.940
We'll play a quick game together.

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:47.363
This is where you earn
the seven and a half minutes

00:12:47.387 --> 00:12:49.387
of bonus life that I promised you earlier.

00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:52.058
All you have to do
is successfully complete

00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:54.399
the first four SuperBetter quests.

00:12:54.423 --> 00:12:57.065
And I feel like you can do it.
I have confidence in you.

00:12:57.089 --> 00:12:58.449
So, everybody ready?

00:12:58.473 --> 00:13:00.736
This is your first quest. Here we go.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.492
Pick one: Stand up and take three steps,

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:06.158
or make your hands into fists,
raise them over your head

00:13:06.182 --> 00:13:08.111
as high as you can for five seconds, go!

00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:11.949
All right, I like the people doing both.

00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:13.578
You are overachievers. Very good.

00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:14.671
(Laughter)

00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:15.718
Well done, everyone.

00:13:15.742 --> 00:13:17.878
That is worth +1 physical resilience,

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:20.624
which means that your body
can withstand more stress

00:13:20.648 --> 00:13:22.163
and heal itself faster.

00:13:22.187 --> 00:13:23.498
We know from the research

00:13:23.522 --> 00:13:26.888
that the number one thing you can do
to boost your physical resilience

00:13:26.912 --> 00:13:28.188
is to not sit still.

00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:29.412
That's all it takes.

00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:32.632
Every single second
that you are not sitting still,

00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:35.424
you are actively improving
the health of your heart,

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:36.757
and your lungs and brains.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.789
Everybody ready for your next quest?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.733
I want you to snap
your fingers exactly 50 times,

00:13:41.757 --> 00:13:45.260
or count backwards from 100
by seven, like this: 100, 93...

00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:46.297
Go!

00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:49.749
(Snapping)

00:13:49.773 --> 00:13:50.836
Don't give up.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.651
(Snapping)

00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:55.707
Don't let the people
counting down from 100

00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:57.437
interfere with your counting to 50.

00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:00.349
(Snapping)

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:01.922
(Laughter)

00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:05.650
Nice. Wow. That's the first
time I've ever seen that.

00:14:05.674 --> 00:14:08.166
Bonus physical resilience.
Well done, everyone.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.736
Now that's worth +1 mental resilience,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.427
which means you have more
mental focus, more discipline,

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.277
determination and willpower.

00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.089
We know from the scientific research

00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:19.240
that willpower
actually works like a muscle.

00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:22.015
It gets stronger the more you exercise it.

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:25.391
So tackling a tiny challenge
without giving up,

00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:28.773
even one as absurd as snapping
your fingers exactly 50 times

00:14:28.797 --> 00:14:30.655
or counting backwards from 100 by seven

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:34.251
is actually a scientifically validated way
to boost your willpower.

00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.253
So good job. Quest number three.

00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:39.541
Pick one: Because of the room,
fate's really determined this for you,

00:14:39.565 --> 00:14:40.949
but here are the two options.

00:14:40.973 --> 00:14:43.427
If you're inside,
find a window and look out of it.

00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:45.979
If you're outside,
find a window and look in.

00:14:46.003 --> 00:14:48.604
Or do a quick YouTube
or Google image search

00:14:48.628 --> 00:14:50.400
for "baby [your favorite animal.]"

00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:53.225
Do it on your phones,
or just shout out some baby animals,

00:14:53.249 --> 00:14:54.801
and I'll put them on the screen.

00:14:54.825 --> 00:14:56.281
So, what do we want to see?

00:14:56.305 --> 00:15:01.758
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake.
Okay, let's see what we got.

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:06.479
Baby dolphin and baby llamas.
Everybody look.

00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:08.253
Got that?

00:15:08.277 --> 00:15:10.508
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.

00:15:10.532 --> 00:15:11.697
(Audience) Oh!

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:13.182
We're clapping for that?

00:15:13.206 --> 00:15:14.390
That's amazing.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.506
(Laughter)

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.029
All right, what we're just feeling there
is plus-one emotional resilience,

00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:21.555
which means you have the ability
to provoke powerful,

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:24.037
positive emotions like curiosity or love,

00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:25.913
which we feel looking at baby animals,

00:15:25.937 --> 00:15:27.164
when you need them most.

00:15:27.188 --> 00:15:29.842
Here's a secret from the scientific
literature for you.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:33.567
If you can manage to experience
three positive emotions

00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:36.092
for every one negative emotion

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:39.084
over the course of an hour, a day, a week,

00:15:39.108 --> 00:15:41.180
you dramatically improve your health

00:15:41.204 --> 00:15:44.764
and your ability to successfully tackle
any problem you're facing.

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:48.043
And this is called the three-to-one
positive emotion ratio.

00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:50.725
It's my favorite
SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.820
All right, pick one, last quest:

00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:54.676
Shake someone's hand for six seconds,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.407
or send someone a quick thank you

00:15:56.431 --> 00:15:58.337
by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!

00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:03.305
(Chatting)

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.024
Looking good, looking good.

00:16:06.746 --> 00:16:07.951
Nice, nice.

00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:09.888
Keep it up.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:11.608
I love it!

00:16:11.632 --> 00:16:15.024
All right, everybody,
that is +1 social resilience,

00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:18.271
which means you actually get
more strength from your friends,

00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:20.392
your neighbors, your family,
your community.

00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:23.901
Now, a great way to boost
social resilience is gratitude.

00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:25.192
Touch is even better.

00:16:25.216 --> 00:16:26.743
Here's one more secret for you:

00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:29.012
Shaking someone's hand for six seconds

00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:32.048
dramatically raises the level
of oxytocin in your bloodstream,

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:33.914
now that's the trust hormone.

00:16:33.938 --> 00:16:36.163
That means that all of you
who just shook hands

00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:39.575
are biochemically primed to like
and want to help each other.

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:42.127
This will linger during the break,

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:44.537
so take advantage
of the networking opportunities.

00:16:44.561 --> 00:16:45.607
(Laughter)

00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:48.337
Well, you have successfully
completed your four quests,

00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:50.764
let's see if I've successfully
completed my mission

00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:53.173
to give you seven and a half
minutes of bonus life.

00:16:53.197 --> 00:16:55.998
Now I get to share one more
little bit of science with you.

00:16:56.022 --> 00:17:00.182
It turns out that people who regularly
boost these four types of resilience --

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:02.721
physical, mental, emotional and social --

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:05.178
live 10 years longer than everyone else.

00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:06.264
So this is true.

00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:10.071
If you are regularly achieving
the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:13.222
if you are never sitting still
for more than an hour at a time,

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:17.091
if you are reaching out to one person
you care about every single day,

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:21.218
if you are tackling tiny goals
to boost your willpower,

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:23.569
you will live 10 years longer
than everyone else,

00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:26.308
and here's where that math
I showed you earlier comes in.

00:17:26.332 --> 00:17:30.331
So, the average life expectancy
in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,

00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:33.459
but we know from more than 1,000
peer-reviewed scientific studies

00:17:33.483 --> 00:17:37.078
that you can add 10 years of life
by boosting your four types of resilience.

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:40.637
So every single year that you are boosting
your four types of resilience,

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:42.910
you're actually earning
.128 more years of life

00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:47.483
or 46 more days of life,
or 67,298 more minutes of life,

00:17:47.507 --> 00:17:51.797
which means every single day,
you are earning 184 minutes of life,

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:55.298
or every single hour that you are boosting
your four types of resilience,

00:17:55.322 --> 00:17:58.563
like we just did together,
you are earning 7.68245837

00:17:58.587 --> 00:17:59.658
more minutes of life.

00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:02.594
Congratulations, those seven
and a half minutes are all yours.

00:18:02.618 --> 00:18:04.094
You totally earned them.

00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:05.125
Yeah!

00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:06.443
(Applause)

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:07.503
Awesome.

00:18:08.294 --> 00:18:09.552
Wait, wait, wait.

00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:14.040
You still have your special mission,
your secret mission.

00:18:14.064 --> 00:18:17.104
How are you going to spend
these minutes of bonus life?

00:18:17.128 --> 00:18:18.821
Well, here's my suggestion.

00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:22.463
These seven and a half bonus minutes
are kind of like genie's wishes.

00:18:22.487 --> 00:18:25.961
You can use your first wish
to wish for a million more wishes.

00:18:25.985 --> 00:18:27.032
Pretty clever, right?

00:18:27.056 --> 00:18:30.887
So, if you spend these
seven and a half minutes today

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:33.521
doing something that makes you happy,

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:35.264
or that gets you physically active,

00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:38.367
or puts you in touch
with someone you care about,

00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:41.200
or even just tackling a tiny challenge,

00:18:41.224 --> 00:18:44.849
you're going to boost your resilience,
so you're going to earn more minutes.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:47.328
And the good news is,
you can keep going like that.

00:18:47.352 --> 00:18:49.632
Every hour of the day,
every day of your life,

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:51.064
all the way to your deathbed,

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:54.041
which will now be 10 years later
than it would have otherwise.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.499
And when you get there, more than likely,

00:18:57.523 --> 00:19:01.039
you will not have
any of those top five regrets,

00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:03.912
because you will have built up
the strength and resilience

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:06.619
to lead a life truer to your dreams.

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:10.635
And with 10 extra years,
you might even have enough time

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:12.578
to play a few more games.

00:19:12.602 --> 00:19:13.681
Thank you.

00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:16.160
(Applause)
