00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.544
There are a lot of ways
the people around us

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.671
can help improve our lives.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.315
We don't bump into every neighbor,

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.386
so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.862
though we do share the same public spaces.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.123
So over the past few years,
I've tried ways to share more

00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:34.463
with my neighbors in public space,

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.447
using simple tools like
stickers, stencils and chalk.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:41.430
And these projects came
from questions I had, like:

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:44.145
How much are my neighbors
paying for their apartments?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.359
(Laughter)

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:47.637
How can we lend and borrow more things,

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:50.660
without knocking on each
other's doors at a bad time?

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:56.031
How can we share more memories
of our abandoned buildings,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.470
and gain a better understanding
of our landscape?

00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:04.129
How can we share more of our hopes
for our vacant storefronts,

00:01:04.153 --> 00:01:07.606
so our communities can reflect
our needs and dreams today?

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.965
Now, I live in New Orleans,

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.306
and I am in love with New Orleans.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.168
My soul is always soothed
by the giant live oak trees,

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:23.564
shading lovers, drunks and dreamers
for hundreds of years,

00:01:23.588 --> 00:01:26.850
and I trust a city that always
makes way for music.

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:29.292
I feel like every time someone sneezes,

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:30.555
New Orleans has a parade.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.864
(Laughter)

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:35.404
The city has some of the most
beautiful architecture in the world,

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:39.348
but it also has one of the highest amounts
of abandoned properties in America.

00:01:40.062 --> 00:01:41.490
I live near this house,

00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:45.355
and I thought about how I could
make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:49.093
and I also thought about something
that changed my life forever.

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:55.120
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.858
Her name was Joan,
and she was a mother to me.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.596
And her death was sudden and unexpected.

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.297
And I thought about death a lot.

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:18.892
And ... this made me feel deep
gratitude for the time I've had.

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:26.447
And ... brought clarity to the things
that are meaningful to my life now.

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:33.978
But I struggle to maintain
this perspective in my daily life.

00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:37.533
I feel like it's easy to get
caught up in the day-to-day,

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.447
and forget what really matters to you.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.370
So with help from old and new friends,

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:46.248
I turned the side of this abandoned
house into a giant chalkboard,

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:49.179
and stenciled it with
a fill-in-the-blank sentence:

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:52.191
"Before I die, I want to ..."

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.802
So anyone walking by
can pick up a piece of chalk,

00:02:56.826 --> 00:02:58.224
reflect on their life,

00:02:58.248 --> 00:03:00.992
and share their personal
aspirations in public space.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:05.840
I didn't know what to expect
from this experiment,

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:09.185
but by the next day,
the wall was entirely filled out,

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.620
and it kept growing.

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.543
And I'd like to share a few things
that people wrote on this wall.

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:20.637
"Before I die, I want
to be tried for piracy."

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:27.105
(Laughter)

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.651
"Before I die, I want to straddle
the International Dateline."

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.730
"Before I die, I want
to sing for millions."

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.962
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:46.891
"Before I die, I want
to live off the grid."

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.082
"Before I die, I want
to hold her one more time."

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.619
"Before I die, I want
to be someone's cavalry."

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:05.353
"Before I die, I want
to be completely myself."

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:13.206
So this neglected space
became a constructive one,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.102
and people's hopes and dreams
made me laugh out loud, tear up,

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:21.015
and they consoled me
during my own tough times.

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.780
It's about knowing you're not alone;

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:27.486
it's about understanding our neighbors
in new and enlightening ways;

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.859
it's about making space
for reflection and contemplation,

00:04:30.883 --> 00:04:35.839
and remembering what really matters
most to us as we grow and change.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.656
I made this last year,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.075
and started receiving hundreds
of messages from passionate people

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.516
who wanted to make a wall
with their community.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.716
So, my civic center colleagues
and I made a tool kit,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.558
and now walls have been made
in countries around the world,

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.995
including Kazakhstan,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:56.730
South Africa,

00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:59.206
Australia,

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.222
Argentina, and beyond.

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.571
Together, we've shown how powerful
our public spaces can be

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.296
if we're given the opportunity
to have a voice,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.395
and share more with one another.

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:15.039
Two of the most valuable things we have

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:18.490
are time, and our relationships
with other people.

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:22.046
In our age of increasing distractions,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.546
it's more important than ever
to find ways to maintain perspective,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.774
and remember that life
is brief and tender.

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:32.568
Death is something that we're
often discouraged to talk about,

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:33.862
or even think about,

00:05:33.886 --> 00:05:36.210
but I've realized that preparing for death

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:38.988
is one of the most empowering
things you can do.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.019
Thinking about death clarifies your life.

00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:47.860
Our shared spaces can better
reflect what matters to us,

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:51.173
as individuals and as a community,

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:55.133
and with more ways to share
our hopes, fears and stories,

00:05:55.157 --> 00:05:59.077
the people around us can not only
help us make better places,

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:01.172
they can help us lead better lives.

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:02.697
Thank you.

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.294
(Applause)

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:08.474
Thank you.

00:06:08.498 --> 00:06:13.937
(Applause)
