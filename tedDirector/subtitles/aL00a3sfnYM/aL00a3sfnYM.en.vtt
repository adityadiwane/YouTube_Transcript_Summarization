00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.718
I study ants

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:18.015
in the desert, in the tropical forest

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:19.543
and in my kitchen,

00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:23.563
and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.239
I've recently realized that ants

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.517
are using interactions differently

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:29.345
in different environments,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.345
and that got me thinking
that we could learn from this

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:32.900
about other systems,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.488
like brains and data networks that we engineer,

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:41.334
and even cancer.

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.086
So what all these systems have in common

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:45.943
is that there's no central control.

00:00:45.943 --> 00:00:49.763
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers --

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:52.149
those are the ants you see walking around â€”

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.305
and then one or more reproductive females

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.408
who just lay the eggs.

00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:58.417
They don't give any instructions.

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:00.401
Even though they're called queens,

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.566
they don't tell anybody what to do.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.842
So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:08.620
and all systems like this without central control

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.539
are regulated using very simple interactions.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.276
Ants interact using smell.

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:17.463
They smell with their antennae,

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:20.224
and they interact with their antennae,

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:23.233
so when one ant touches another with its antennae,

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.840
it can tell, for example, if the other ant

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.474
is a nestmate

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:30.710
and what task that other ant has been doing.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.910
So here you see a lot of ants moving around

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.843
and interacting in a lab arena

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:39.281
that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.785
So when one ant meets another,

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.874
it doesn't matter which ant it meets,

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.759
and they're actually not transmitting

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.224
any kind of complicated signal or message.

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:51.335
All that matters to the ant is the rate

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.156
at which it meets other ants.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.913
And all of these interactions, taken together,

00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:59.418
produce a network.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.628
So this is the network of the ants

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:04.272
that you just saw moving around in the arena,

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:07.559
and it's this constantly shifting network

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.079
that produces the behavior of the colony,

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.960
like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.654
or how many are going out to forage.

00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:17.413
A brain actually works in the same way,

00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:18.913
but what's great about ants is

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:23.780
that you can see the whole network as it happens.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.880
There are more than 12,000 species of ants,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.005
in every conceivable environment,

00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:31.654
and they're using interactions differently

00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:34.422
to meet different environmental challenges.

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:36.727
So one important environmental challenge

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:38.597
that every system has to deal with

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:40.680
is operating costs, just what it takes

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.945
to run the system.

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.493
And another environmental challenge is resources,

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:47.829
finding them and collecting them.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.612
In the desert, operating costs are high

00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:52.385
because water is scarce,

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.884
and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:57.784
have to spend water to get water.

00:02:57.784 --> 00:02:59.923
So an ant outside foraging,

00:02:59.923 --> 00:03:01.960
searching for seeds in the hot sun,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.967
just loses water into the air.

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.631
But the colony gets its water

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:07.397
by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds

00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:09.331
that they eat.

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:12.490
So in this environment, interactions are used

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.039
to activate foraging.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.303
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless

00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:18.876
it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.866
and what you see are the returning foragers

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.690
going into the tunnel, into the nest,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.326
and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:26.949
This makes sense for the ant colony,

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.272
because the more food there is out there,

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:31.123
the more quickly the foragers find it,

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:32.359
the faster they come back,

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.160
and the more foragers they send out.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.667
The system works to stay stopped,

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:39.682
unless something positive happens.

00:03:39.682 --> 00:03:43.563
So interactions function to activate foragers.

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:46.470
And we've been studying
the evolution of this system.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.561
First of all, there's variation.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.040
It turns out that colonies are different.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.736
On dry days, some colonies forage less,

00:03:52.736 --> 00:03:54.241
so colonies are different in how

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:55.595
they manage this trade-off

00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:58.763
between spending water to search for seeds

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:02.083
and getting water back in the form of seeds.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:03.802
And we're trying to understand why

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:05.942
some colonies forage less than others

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:08.267
by thinking about ants as neurons,

00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:10.605
using models from neuroscience.

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.279
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.285
from other neurons to decide whether to fire,

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.170
an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.193
to decide whether to forage.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.830
And what we're looking for is whether there might be

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.822
small differences among colonies

00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:27.136
in how many interactions each ant needs

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:29.062
before it's willing to go out and forage,

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:32.829
because a colony like that would forage less.

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.968
And this raises an analogous question about brains.

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:37.380
We talk about the brain,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.270
but of course every brain is slightly different,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.649
and maybe there are some individuals

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:42.968
or some conditions

00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:46.190
in which the electrical properties of neurons are such

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.060
that they require more stimulus to fire,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.786
and that would lead to differences in brain function.

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:56.120
So in order to ask evolutionary questions,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.799
we need to know about reproductive success.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.124
This is a map of the study site

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:03.677
where I have been tracking this population

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:06.970
of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.232
which is about as long as a colony lives.

00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:11.331
Each symbol is a colony,

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:14.597
and the size of the symbol is
how many offspring it had,

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:16.510
because we were able to use genetic variation

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.221
to match up parent and offspring colonies,

00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:22.518
that is, to figure out which colonies

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:24.443
were founded by a daughter queen

00:05:24.443 --> 00:05:26.511
produced by which parent colony.

00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:28.513
And this was amazing for me, after all these years,

00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:31.641
to find out, for example, that colony 154,

00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:33.817
whom I've known well for many years,

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:35.636
is a great-grandmother.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:37.376
Here's her daughter colony,

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:40.060
here's her granddaughter colony,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.452
and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:44.477
And by doing this, I was able to learn

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.760
that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.977
in their decisions about which days are so hot

00:05:49.977 --> 00:05:51.755
that they don't forage,

00:05:51.755 --> 00:05:53.219
and the offspring of parent colonies

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.125
live so far from each other that the ants never meet,

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.414
so the ants of the offspring colony

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:00.658
can't be learning this from the parent colony.

00:06:00.658 --> 00:06:02.039
And so our next step is to look

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.315
for the genetic variation
underlying this resemblance.

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:11.440
So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.900
Over the time of the study,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.365
and especially in the past 10 years,

00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:17.673
there's been a very severe and deepening drought

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:19.800
in the Southwestern U.S.,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.853
and it turns out that the
colonies that conserve water,

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:27.282
that stay in when it's really hot outside,

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:29.914
and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:32.859
are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.128
So all this time, I thought that colony 154

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.798
was a loser, because on really dry days,

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:39.666
there'd be just this trickle of foraging,

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.257
while the other colonies were out

00:06:41.257 --> 00:06:43.374
foraging, getting lots of food,

00:06:43.374 --> 00:06:46.394
but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:47.726
She's a matriarch.

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:50.778
She's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.

00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:53.563
To my knowledge, this is the first time

00:06:53.563 --> 00:06:55.202
that we've been able to track

00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:58.203
the ongoing evolution of collective behavior

00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.320
in a natural population of animals

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.977
and find out what's actually working best.

00:07:04.977 --> 00:07:07.398
Now, the Internet uses an algorithm

00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:10.251
to regulate the flow of data

00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:12.478
that's very similar to the one

00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:14.854
that the harvester ants are using to regulate

00:07:14.854 --> 00:07:16.395
the flow of foragers.

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.761
And guess what we call this analogy?

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:21.279
The anternet is coming.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.000
(Applause)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.454
So data doesn't leave the source computer

00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:29.315
unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.044
for it to travel on.

00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:33.485
In the early days of the Internet,

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:35.759
when operating costs were really high

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.986
and it was really important not to lose any data,

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:41.143
then the system was set up for interactions

00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:44.205
to activate the flow of data.

00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:46.590
It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.486
that's so similar to the one that we recently invented,

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:53.439
but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.858
that we know about,

00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:58.051
and ants have had 130 million years

00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:00.077
to evolve a lot of good ones,

00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:01.583
and I think it's very likely

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:04.140
that some of the other 12,000 species

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.837
are going to have interesting algorithms

00:08:06.837 --> 00:08:07.861
for data networks

00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.558
that we haven't even thought of yet.

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:13.643
So what happens when operating costs are low?

00:08:13.643 --> 00:08:15.430
Operating costs are low in the tropics,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.526
because it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:20.350
to be outside walking around.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.003
But the ants are so abundant

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.821
and diverse in the tropics

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:26.419
that there's a lot of competition.

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:28.371
Whatever resource one species is using,

00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:31.543
another species is likely to be using that

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:33.922
at the same time.

00:08:33.922 --> 00:08:36.530
So in this environment, interactions are used

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.475
in the opposite way.

00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:39.870
The system keeps going

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.424
unless something negative happens,

00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:43.591
and one species that I study makes circuits

00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.750
in the trees of foraging ants

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.731
going from the nest to a food source and back,

00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:50.060
just round and round,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.502
unless something negative happens,

00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:53.111
like an interaction

00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:55.850
with ants of another species.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.787
So here's an example of ant security.

00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:00.645
In the middle, there's an ant

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:03.108
plugging the nest entrance with its head

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:06.101
in response to interactions with another species.

00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:07.760
Those are the little ones running around

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.511
with their abdomens up in the air.

00:09:10.511 --> 00:09:12.557
But as soon as the threat is passed,

00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:15.312
the entrance is open again,

00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:17.102
and maybe there are situations

00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:18.191
in computer security

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.397
where operating costs are low enough

00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:23.772
that we could just block access temporarily

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.965
in response to an immediate threat,

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.991
and then open it again,

00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:29.260
instead of trying to build

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.240
a permanent firewall or fortress.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.180
So another environmental challenge

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.875
that all systems have to deal with

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:42.327
is resources, finding and collecting them.

00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.000
And to do this, ants solve the problem

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.258
of collective search,

00:09:45.258 --> 00:09:46.834
and this is a problem that's of great interest

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:48.318
right now in robotics,

00:09:48.318 --> 00:09:50.050
because we've understood that,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.664
rather than sending a single,

00:09:51.664 --> 00:09:55.159
sophisticated, expensive robot out

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.576
to explore another planet

00:09:56.576 --> 00:09:59.143
or to search a burning building,

00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:01.743
that instead, it may be more effective

00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:06.120
to get a group of cheaper robots

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.665
exchanging only minimal information,

00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:11.464
and that's the way that ants do it.

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:13.229
So the invasive Argentine ant

00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:15.559
makes expandable search networks.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:17.832
They're good at dealing with the main problem

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:19.163
of collective search,

00:10:19.163 --> 00:10:21.729
which is the trade-off between

00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:23.065
searching very thoroughly

00:10:23.065 --> 00:10:25.062
and covering a lot of ground.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:25.957
And what they do is,

00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:28.344
when there are many ants in a small space,

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:30.557
then each one can search very thoroughly

00:10:30.557 --> 00:10:32.181
because there will be another ant nearby

00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:33.538
searching over there,

00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:35.185
but when there are a few ants

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:37.240
in a large space,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.654
then they need to stretch out their paths

00:10:39.654 --> 00:10:41.457
to cover more ground.

00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:44.411
I think they use interactions to assess density,

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.640
so when they're really crowded,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.742
they meet more often,

00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:49.207
and they search more thoroughly.

00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:52.607
Different ant species must use different algorithms,

00:10:52.607 --> 00:10:55.129
because they've evolved to deal with

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.800
different resources,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.359
and it could be really useful to know about this,

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.001
and so we recently asked ants

00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:03.451
to solve the collective search problem

00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:04.819
in the extreme environment

00:11:04.819 --> 00:11:06.377
of microgravity

00:11:06.377 --> 00:11:08.353
in the International Space Station.

00:11:08.353 --> 00:11:09.898
When I first saw this picture, I thought,

00:11:09.898 --> 00:11:12.755
Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.373
but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.

00:11:15.373 --> 00:11:18.010
So the idea here is that the ants

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.980
are working so hard to hang on

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.037
to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it

00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:26.046
that they're less likely to interact,

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:27.290
and so the relationship between

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.410
how crowded they are and how often they meet

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.135
would be messed up.

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:32.530
We're still analyzing the data.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.494
I don't have the results yet.

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:36.188
But it would be interesting to know

00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:38.647
how other species solve this problem

00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:41.211
in different environments on Earth,

00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:42.477
and so we're setting up a program

00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:44.637
to encourage kids around the world

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:47.173
to try this experiment with different species.

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.940
It's very simple.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.030
It can be done with cheap materials.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.863
And that way, we could make a global map

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:57.210
of ant collective search algorithms.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.693
And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,

00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:01.842
the ones that come into our buildings,

00:12:01.842 --> 00:12:03.584
are going to be really good at this,

00:12:03.584 --> 00:12:05.432
because they're in your kitchen

00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:09.339
because they're really good
at finding food and water.

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:12.604
So the most familiar resource for ants

00:12:12.604 --> 00:12:13.919
is a picnic,

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.064
and this is a clustered resource.

00:12:16.064 --> 00:12:17.063
When there's one piece of fruit,

00:12:17.063 --> 00:12:19.578
there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,

00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:23.010
and the ants that specialize on clustered resources

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.952
use interactions for recruitment.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:26.229
So when one ant meets another,

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:27.854
or when it meets a chemical deposited

00:12:27.854 --> 00:12:29.590
on the ground by another,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.423
then it changes direction to follow

00:12:31.423 --> 00:12:32.996
in the direction of the interaction,

00:12:32.996 --> 00:12:34.973
and that's how you get the trail of ants

00:12:34.973 --> 00:12:36.386
sharing your picnic.

00:12:36.386 --> 00:12:38.081
Now this is a place where I think we might be able

00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:41.822
to learn something from ants about cancer.

00:12:41.822 --> 00:12:43.803
I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot

00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:45.413
to prevent cancer

00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:47.990
by not allowing people to spread around

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.934
or sell the toxins that promote

00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:52.714
the evolution of cancer in our bodies,

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:55.060
but I don't think the ants can help us much with this

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.418
because ants never poison their own colonies.

00:12:58.418 --> 00:12:59.750
But we might be able to learn something from ants

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.513
about treating cancer.

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:03.738
There are many different kinds of cancer.

00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:06.716
Each one originates in a particular part of the body,

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:09.682
and then some kinds of cancer will spread

00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:12.512
or metastasize to particular other tissues

00:13:12.512 --> 00:13:15.392
where they must be getting
resources that they need.

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:17.200
So if you think from the perspective

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.150
of early metastatic cancer cells

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.773
as they're out searching around

00:13:20.773 --> 00:13:23.090
for the resources that they need,

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.073
if those resources are clustered,

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:28.086
they're likely to use interactions for recruitment,

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:31.179
and if we can figure out how
cancer cells are recruiting,

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:33.526
then maybe we could set traps

00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:37.575
to catch them before they become established.

00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:40.810
So ants are using interactions in different ways

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.412
in a huge variety of environments,

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:45.233
and we could learn from this

00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:47.010
about other systems that operate

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.347
without central control.

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:51.326
Using only simple interactions,

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:53.121
ant colonies have been performing

00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:56.754
amazing feats for more than 130 million years.

00:13:56.754 --> 00:13:58.894
We have a lot to learn from them.

00:13:58.894 --> 00:14:01.632
Thank you.

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.365
