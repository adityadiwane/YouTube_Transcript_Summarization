00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So, I am indeed going to talk about

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
the spaces men create for themselves,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
are my two sons Ford and Wren.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
When Ford was about three years old,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
we shared a very small room together,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in a very small space.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
My office was on one half of the bedroom,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and his bedroom was on the other half.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And you can imagine, if you're a writer,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that things would get really crowded around deadlines.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So when Wren was on the way,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and without any previous building experience,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and about 3,000 dollars and some

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
recycled materials, I built this space.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
As I was building this space, I thought

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to have to have carved out a space for his own."

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So I did some research.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And I found that there was an historic precedence.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Hemingway had his writing space.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Elvis had two or three manspaces,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and there was, of course, the Batcave.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and see what guys were creating for themselves now.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
which is where I'm from.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
But on the inside, it's anything but.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It has neon concert posters, a bar

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and, of course, the leg lamp,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
which is very important.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
This a 1923 wooden tugboat,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
made completely out of Douglas fir.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
The guy did it all himself.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
So, pretty early on in my investigations

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
There were definitely hang-out spots.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
But some were for working, some were for playing,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
some were for guys to collect their things.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Take this place for example.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
This is in Long Island, New York.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
On the inside it's a recreation of a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
16th century Japanese tea house.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
The man imported all the materials from Japan,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and he hired a Japanese carpenter

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to build it in the traditional style.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It has no nails or screws.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But you open one of the garage doors

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.260
(Laughter)

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And so there is a good reason for this.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
He won the silver medal for Ireland

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
in the 1992 Olympics,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So, while this space represents someone's profession,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
this one certainly represents a passion.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Museum quality.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
So, as I came to the end of my journey,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I found over 50 spaces.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And they were unexpected and they were surprising.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But they were also --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I was really impressed by how personalized they were,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
and how much work went into them.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And I realized that's because the guys that I met

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
were all very passionate about what they did.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And they really loved their professions.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And so they created these spaces

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to reflect what they love to do,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and who they were.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
So if you don't have a space of your own,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
(Applause)
