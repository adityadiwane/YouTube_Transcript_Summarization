00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
We live on a human-dominated planet,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
putting unprecedented pressure

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
on the systems on Earth.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
it's also part of the good news.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We're the first generation -- thanks to science --

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to be informed that we may be

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
undermining the stability and the ability

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
of planet Earth

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to support human development as we know it.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
are so large,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
that business as usual is not an option.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
In fact, we're in a phase

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
where transformative change is necessary,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
which opens the window for innovation,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
for new ideas and new paradigms.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
in the global phase of sustainability.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
a good friend,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
a stakeholder, who's always absent

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
a stakeholder who refuses to compromise --

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
planet Earth.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
to have her as a witness

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
of a remarkable journey,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
which humbly reminds us

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
of the period of grace we've had

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
over the past 10,000 years.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
It's a very important period --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
We've had the same, roughly, abilities

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that developed civilizations as we know it.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
This is the environmental conditions on the planet.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
we leave Africa, we colonize Australia

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in another crisis, 60,000 years back,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
we leave Asia for Europe

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
in another crisis, 40,000 years back,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and then we enter

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the remarkably stable Holocene phase,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
the only period in the whole history of the planet,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that we know of, that can support human development.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
A thousand years into this period,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
We go from a couple of million people

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to the seven billion people we are today.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
we domesticate animals and plants.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
The only phase, as we know it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
that can support humanity.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
on this poor planet,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
has population growth of course.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Now, this is not only about numbers;

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
have been caused by the rich minority,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
in the mid-18th century.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The majority of the planet,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
aspiring for development, having the right for development,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
a momentous pressure.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
is that it would be enough

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
to avoid average temperatures

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
exceeding two degrees,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
holding six meters -- level rising,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Now, you would have wished the climate pressure

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
but unfortunately, the third pressure

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is the ecosystem decline.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
such a sharp decline

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
in our forests, land and biodiversity.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
The forth pressure is surprise,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
the notion and the evidence

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that we need to abandon our old paradigm,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and that in fact, surprise is universal,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and often irreversibly.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
of momentous scale.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
the Anthropocene,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
where humans are the predominant driver of change

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
at a planetary level.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Now, as a scientist,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
what's the evidence for this?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Well, the evidence is,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
unfortunately, ample.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It's not only carbon dioxide

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
You can take virtually any parameter

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that matters for human well-being --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
nitrous oxide, methane,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
deforestation, overfishing

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
land degredation, loss of species --

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
they all show the same pattern

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
over the past 200 years.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
10 years after the Second World War,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
starts in the mid-50s.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And I can tell you,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
you find something remarkably important,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
the conclusion that we may have come to the point

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
where we have to bend the curves,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
in the history humanity on the planet,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
the decade when we have to bend the curves.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Now, as if this was not enough --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
we also have to recognize the fact

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that systems do have multiple stable states,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Now, the system may gradually --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
under pressure of climate change,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
erosion, biodiversity loss --

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
but appear to be healthy

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
be tipping over. Upff.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
Sorry. Changing state

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and literally ending up

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
in an undesired situation,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
where new biophysical logic takes over,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
new species take over, and the system gets locked.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
under multiple pressures of overfishing,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
unsustainable tourism, climate change.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
A trigger and the system tips over,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
loses its resilience,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
soft corals take over,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and we get undesired systems

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
that cannot support economic and social development.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
The Arctic -- a beautiful system --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
a regulating biome at the planetary level,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
taking the knock after knock on climate change,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
appearing to be in a good state.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
No scientist could predict that in 2007,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of its summer ice cover.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And the drama is, of course, that

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
when the system does this, the logic may change.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
It may get locked in an undesired state,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
because it changes color, absorbs more energy,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and the system may get stuck.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
that we are in a precarious situation.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
was a submarine from an unnamed country

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to be able to control the oil resources.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
that wetlands, forests,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
behave in this nonlinear way.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
30 or so scientists around the world

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
gathered and asked a question for the first time,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So we have to ask ourselves:

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
where we're coming too close

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to thresholds that could lead

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
to deleterious and very undesired,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
if now catastrophic, change

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
for human development?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
You know, you don't want to stand there.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
where this gentleman is standing,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
In fact, there's a fence

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
quite upstream of this threshold,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
beyond which you are in a danger zone.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And this is the new paradigm,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
which we gathered two, three years back,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
recognizing that our old paradigm

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of just analyzing and pushing and predicting

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
parameters into the future,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Now we to ask ourselves:

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
which are the large environmental processes

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
that we have to be stewards of

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And could we even,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
identify the thresholds,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
the points where we may expect nonlinear change?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
And could we even define

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
a planetary boundary, a fence,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
This work, which was published in "Nature,"

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
late 2009,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
after a number of years of analysis,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
led to the final proposition

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
that we can only find

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
nine planetary boundaries

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
with which, under active stewardship,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
These include, of course, climate.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
with the three big systems, climate change,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
being the three big systems,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
the systems that, under the hood,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
freshwater use,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
functions which regulate

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
air pollution,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
but also chemical pollution.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Together, these form an integrated whole

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
understanding that the planet

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
is a complex self-regulating system.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
In fact, most evidence indicates

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
"One for all. All for one."

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
you undermine the ability of the climate system

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
to stay stable.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
The drama here is, in fact, that

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
it may show that the climate challenge

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
is the easy one,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
if you consider the whole challenge

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
of sustainable development.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
the quantified boundaries,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
as suggested by this analysis.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
the pre-industrial point,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
where we're very safely in the safe operating space.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
In the '50s, we start branching out.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
In the '60s already, through the green revolution

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and the Haber-Bosch process

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
actually, right after Rio.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And today, we are in a situation where we estimate

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
that we've transgressed three boundaries,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
the rate of biodiversity loss,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
nitrogen and climate change.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
but we are approaching fast

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
But this gives a new paradigm

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
to guide humanity,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
to put the light on our, so far

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
overpowered industrial vehicle,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
which operates as if

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
we're only on a dark, straight highway.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Now the question then is:

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
how gloomy is this?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Is then sustainable development utopia?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Well, there's no science to suggest.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
In fact, there is ample science

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
to indicate that we can do this transformative change,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
that we have the ability

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
to now move into a new innovative,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
a transformative gear,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
across scales.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
The drama is, of course,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
is that 200 countries on this planet

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
have to simultaneously start moving

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
in the same direction.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
from the current linear,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
command and control thinking,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
looking at efficiencies and optimization

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
towards a much more flexible,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
a much more adaptive approach,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
where we recognize that redundancy,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
both in social and environmental systems,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
is key to be able to deal

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
with a turbulent era of global change.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
We have to invest in persistence,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
in the ability of social systems and ecological systems

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
We have to invest in transformations capability,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
moving from crisis into innovation

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and the ability to rise after a crisis,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
This is a new paradigm.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
But is it happening anywhere?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Do we have any examples of success

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
on this mind shift being applied at the local level?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Well, yes, in fact we do

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and the list can start becoming longer and longer.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
There's good news here,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
for example, from Latin America,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
where plow-based farming systems

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
of the '50s and '60s

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
led farming basically to a dead-end,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
among farmers in partnership with scientists

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
combined with mulch farming

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
with locally adapted technologies,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
which today, for example, in some countries,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
have led to a tremendous increase

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in area under mulch, zero till farming

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
which, not only produces more food,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
but also sequesters carbon.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Under the realization from tourist operators,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
fishermen,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
under the current governance regime.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
Global change, beautification rack culture,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
overfishing and unsustainable tourism,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
all together placing this system

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
in the realization of crisis.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
which today has led to a completely new governance strategy

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to build resilience,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
acknowledge redundancy

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and then allow for much more redundancy in the system.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Sweden, the country I come from, has other examples,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as --

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
as in many countries -- as flood-prone polluted nuisance

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
in the peri-urban regions.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
But again, a crisis, new partnerships,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
actors locally, transforming these

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
into a key component

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
of sustainable urban planning.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So crisis leading into opportunities.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Now, what about the future?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
which is feeding a world of nine billion people.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
We need nothing less than a new green revolution,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and the planet boundaries shows

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
It has to basically do this on current land.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
We cannot expand anymore,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
because it erodes the planetary boundaries.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And we need a transformation.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
Well, interestingly, and based on my work

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and others in Africa, for example,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
with innovations and supplementary irrigation

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
to bridge dry spells and droughts,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
from toilets back to farmers' fields,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and innovations in tillage systems,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
we can triple, quadruple, yield levels

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
on current land.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Elinor Ostrom,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
the latest Nobel laureate of economics,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
clearly shows empirically across the world

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
that we can govern the commons

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
if we invest in trust,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
local, action-based partnerships

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and cross-scale institutional innovations,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
where local actors,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
together, can deal with the global commons

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
at a large scale.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
And what shall we do?

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
but for example, one policy measure,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
feed-in tariffs on the energy system,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
which is already applied,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
from China doing it on offshore wind systems,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
all the way to the U.S.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
but you can subsidize electricity to poor people.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
You get people out of poverty.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
while at the same time, stimulating innovation --

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
examples of things that can be out scaled quickly

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
at the planetary level.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
and we can list many, many examples

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
of transformative opportunities around the planet.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
The key though in all of these,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
the red thread,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
is the shift in mindset,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
into a dark future,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
where we instead backcast our future,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
What are the planetary boundaries

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
within which we can safely operate?"

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and then backtrack innovations within that.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
that incremental change is not an option.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
So, there is scientific evidence.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
They sort of say the harsh news,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
that we are facing the largest

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
transformative development

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
since the industrialization.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
In fact, what we have to do over the next 40 years

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
is much more dramatic and more exciting

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
than what we did when we moved into

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
the situation we're in today.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Now, science indicates that,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
yes, we can achieve a prosperous future

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
within the safe operating space,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
if we move simultaneously,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
in transformative options, which build resilience on a finite planet.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Thank you.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.260
(Applause)
