00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.828
(Music)

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.798
["Oedipus Rex"]

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:30.605
["The Lion King"]

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:38.917
["Titus"]

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:55.580
["Frida"]

00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:10.225
["The Magic Flute"]

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:18.358
["Across The Universe"]

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.238
(Applause)

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:34.445
Julie Taymor: Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.162
That's a few samples of the theater, opera

00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:40.504
and films that I have done
over the last 20 years.

00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:42.542
But what I'd like to begin with right now

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.445
is to take you back to a moment

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.910
that I went through in Indonesia,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.047
which is a seminal moment in my life

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:51.127
and, like all myths,

00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.382
these stories need to be retold

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:55.881
and told, lest we forget them.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.905
And when I'm in the turbulent
times, as we know,

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.293
that I am right now, through the crucible

00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:03.484
and the fire of transformation,

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:06.102
which is what all of you do, actually.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.226
Anybody who creates knows
there's that point where

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.335
it hasn't quite become
the phoenix or the burnt char.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.433
(Laughter)

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:19.338
And I am right there on the edge,

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:21.315
which I'll tell you about, another story.

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.768
I want to go back to Indonesia

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:26.452
where I was about 21, 22
years, a long time ago,

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:27.676
on a fellowship.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.606
And I found myself, after two years there

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.955
and performing and learning,
on the island of Bali,

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.782
on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:40.799
And I was in a village where there was

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:43.591
an initiation ceremony for the young men,

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:45.155
a rite of passage.

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.707
Little did I know that it
was mine as well.

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.166
And as I sat in this temple square

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.166
under this gigantic beringin banyan tree,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.003
in the dark, there was no
electricity, just the full moon,

00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:00.059
down in this empty square,

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:02.209
and I heard the most beautiful sounds,

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.040
like a Charles Ives concert

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:06.083
as I listened to the gamelan music

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:08.132
from all the different villagers that came

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:11.530
for this once-every-five-years ceremony.

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:15.125
And I thought I was alone
in the dark under this tree.

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.956
And all of a sudden, out of the dark,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.840
from the other end of the square,

00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:23.748
I saw the glint of mirrors
lit by the moon.

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:27.307
And these 20 old men who I'd seen before

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:32.609
all of a sudden stood up in these
full warrior costumes

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:35.094
with the headdress and the spears,

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:39.456
and no one was in the square,
and I was hidden in the shadows.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.817
No one was there, and they came out,

00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:45.456
and they did this incredible dance.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.148
"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:52.321
And they moved their bodies
and they came forward,

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:55.123
and the lights bounced off these costumes.

00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:58.539
And I've been in theater
since I was 11 years old,

00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:01.753
and performing, creating, and I went,

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:03.896
"Who are they performing for

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.243
with these elaborate costumes,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:08.270
these extraordinary headdresses?"

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:13.057
And I realized that they were
performing for God,

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.768
whatever that means.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:19.356
But somehow, it didn't
matter about the publicity.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.607
There was no money involved.

00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:24.827
It wasn't going to be written down.
It was no news.

00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.973
And there were these incredible artists

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.474
that felt for me like an eternity
as they performed.

00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:32.559
The next moment,

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.619
as soon as they finished
and disappeared into the shadows,

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.125
a young man with a propane
lantern came on,

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.376
hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.837
The village square was filled
with hundreds of people.

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.375
And they put on an opera all night long.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.635
Human beings needed the light.

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.272
They needed the light to see.

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:55.920
So what I gained and gathered
from this incredible,

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.532
seminal moment in my life
as a young artist

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:01.855
was that you must be true

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.927
to what you believe as an artist
all the way through,

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.466
but you also have to be aware

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.955
that the audience is out there
in our lives at this time,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.360
and they also need the light.

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.523
And it's this incredible balance

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:18.272
that I think that we walk

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:21.605
when we are creating something
that is breaking ground,

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.259
that's trying to do something
you've never seen before,

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:25.945
that imaginary world

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.322
where you actually don't know
where you're going to end up,

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.088
that's the fine line
on the edge of a crater

00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:34.718
that I have walked my whole life.

00:05:34.742 --> 00:05:37.266
What I would like to do now is to tell you

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.072
a little bit

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.929
about how I work.
Let's take "The Lion King."

00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:44.181
You saw many examples of my work up there,

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:46.126
but it's one that people know.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.825
I start with the notion of the ideograph.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.200
An ideograph is like a brush
painting, a Japanese brush painting.

00:05:52.224 --> 00:05:55.709
Three strokes, you get
the whole bamboo forest.

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:58.240
I go to the concept of "The Lion King"

00:05:58.264 --> 00:06:00.308
and I say, "What is the essence of it?

00:06:00.332 --> 00:06:01.944
What is the abstraction?

00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:05.205
If I were to reduce this entire story

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.946
into one image, what would it be?"

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.900
The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.

00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:14.877
The circle of life. The
circle of Mufasa's mask.

00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.417
The circle that, when we come
to Act II and there's a drought,

00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:20.896
how do you express drought?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.055
It's a circle of silk on the floor

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:28.109
that disappears into the hole
in the stage floor.

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:30.738
The circle of life comes in the wheels

00:06:30.762 --> 00:06:33.186
of the gazelles that leap.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.908
And you see the mechanics.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:38.286
And being a theater person, what I know
and love about the theater

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.981
is that when the audience comes in

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:41.775
and they suspend their disbelief,

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:44.610
when you see men walking or women walking

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:46.507
with a platter of grass on their heads,

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.123
you know it's the savanna.

00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:49.667
You don't question that.

00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.151
I love the apparent truth of theater.

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.748
I love that people are willing
to fill in the blanks.

00:06:55.772 --> 00:06:57.768
The audience is willing to say,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.768
"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:03.076
You took pieces of sticks.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.171
You added silk to the bottom.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:08.875
You suspended these pieces. You
let it fall flat on the floor.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:13.278
And as it rises with the strings,
I see that it's a sun.

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:17.685
But the beauty of it
is that it's just silk and sticks.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:22.237
And in a way, that is what makes
it spiritual.

00:07:22.261 --> 00:07:23.682
That's what moves you.

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:27.898
It's not the actual literal
sunrise that's coming.

00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:29.429
It's the art of it.

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:34.789
So in the theater, as much
as the story is critical

00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:36.694
and the book and the language,

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:41.345
the telling of the story, how it's told,

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:44.963
the mechanics, the methods that you use,

00:07:44.987 --> 00:07:47.562
is equal to the story itself.

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:50.900
And I'm one who loves
high tech and low tech.

00:07:50.924 --> 00:07:52.699
So I could go from --

00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.200
For instance, I'll show you
some "Spider-Man" later,

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.776
these incredible machines
that move people along.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.142
But the fact is, without the dancer

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:02.895
who knows how to use his body
and swing on those wires,

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:04.682
it's nothing.

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:07.591
So now I'm going to show you

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:11.909
some clips from the other big
project of my life this year,

00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:12.951
"The Tempest."

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.044
It's a movie. I did "The
Tempest" on a stage three times

00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:20.281
in the theater since 1984, '86,

00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:22.485
and I love the play.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:25.011
I did it always with a male Prospero.

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:26.673
And all of a sudden, I thought,

00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:28.759
"Well, who am I gonna
get to play Prospero?

00:08:28.783 --> 00:08:32.481
Why not Helen Mirren?
She's a great actor. Why not?"

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:35.741
And this material really did work
for a woman equally as well.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.836
So now, let's take a look
at some of the images

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.829
from "The Tempest."

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:45.836
(Music)

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.459
(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed
to the point the tempest that I bade thee?

00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:06.991
Ariel: I boarded the king's ship.
In every cabin, I flamed amazement.

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:12.596
Prospera: At first sight,
they have changed eyes.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.791
Miranda: Do you love me?

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:15.167
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.

00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:17.759
HM: They are both in either's powers.

00:09:17.783 --> 00:09:22.890
Trinculo: Misery acquaints
a man with strange bedfellows.

00:09:22.914 --> 00:09:26.132
(Music)

00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:29.609
Looking for business, governor?

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:31.681
Caliban: Hast thou not
dropped from heaven?

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.166
Stephano: Out of the moon,
I do assure thee.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.163
Prospera: Caliban!

00:09:36.187 --> 00:09:38.428
Caliban: This island is mine.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:41.973
Prospera: For this, be sure,
tonight thou shalt have cramps.

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:45.482
Antonio: Here lies your brother no
better than the earth he lies upon.

00:09:45.506 --> 00:09:47.281
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.

00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:50.890
And I, the king, shall love thee.

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:56.300
Prospera: I will plague
them all, even to roaring.

00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:02.706
Ariel: I have made you mad.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.895
Prospera: We are such stuff
as dreams are made on.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:16.106
and our little life
is rounded with a sleep.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.431
(Music)

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.281
JT: Okay.

00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:28.255
(Applause)

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.683
So I went from theater,
doing "The Tempest"

00:10:30.707 --> 00:10:33.007
on the stage in a very
low-budget production

00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.645
many years ago,

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:37.090
and I love the play, and I also think

00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:39.114
it's Shakespeare's last play,

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:42.794
and it really lends itself,
as you can see, to cinema.

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:45.342
But I'm just going to give
you a little example about

00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:47.247
how one stages it in theater

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:51.308
and then how one takes
that same idea or story

00:10:51.332 --> 00:10:54.300
and moves it into cinema.

00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:57.396
The ideograph that I talked
to you about before,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.507
what is it for "The Tempest"?

00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:02.333
What, if I were to boil it down,

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.646
would be the one image that I could

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.893
hang my hat on for this?

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.181
And it was the sand castle,

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:12.321
the idea of nurture versus nature,

00:11:12.345 --> 00:11:14.776
that we build these civilizations --

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.731
she speaks about it at the end,
Helen Mirren's Prospera --

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:23.204
we build them, but under nature,
under the grand tempest,

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:28.699
these cloud-capped towers, these
gorgeous palaces will fade

00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:32.922
and there will -- leave not a rack behind.

00:11:32.946 --> 00:11:35.551
So in the theater, I started the play,

00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:38.613
it was a black sand rake, white cyc,

00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:41.538
and there was a little girl,
Miranda, on the horizon,

00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:44.206
building a drip castle, a sand castle.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.646
And as she was there
on the edge of that stage,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.007
two stagehands all in black

00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:55.511
with watering cans ran along the top

00:11:55.535 --> 00:12:00.138
and started to pour water
on the sand castle,

00:12:00.162 --> 00:12:02.908
and the sand castle
started to drip and sink,

00:12:02.932 --> 00:12:04.307
but before it did,

00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:08.547
the audience saw
the black-clad stagehands.

00:12:08.571 --> 00:12:13.134
The medium was apparent. It was banal.
We saw it.

00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:16.117
But as they started to pour the water,

00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:19.849
the light changed from showing
you the black-clad stagehands

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:23.163
to focusing, this rough magic
that we do in theater,

00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:26.716
it focused right on the water itself.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.938
And all of a sudden,
the audience's perspective changes.

00:12:30.962 --> 00:12:34.444
It becomes something magically large.

00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:37.076
It becomes the rainstorm.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.720
The masked actors,
the puppeteers, they disappear,

00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:43.920
and the audience makes
that leap into this world,

00:12:43.944 --> 00:12:48.243
into this imaginary world of "The
Tempest" actually happening.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.672
Now the difference

00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:52.275
when I went and did it in the cinema,

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:54.659
I started the actual movie

00:12:54.683 --> 00:12:59.941
with a close-up of a sand
castle, a black sand castle,

00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:01.779
and what cinema can do is,

00:13:01.803 --> 00:13:05.235
by using camera, perspective,

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:07.977
and also long shots and close-ups,

00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:10.296
it started on a close-up
of the sand castle,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.179
and as it pulled away,

00:13:12.203 --> 00:13:15.213
you saw that it was a miniature
sitting in the palm

00:13:15.237 --> 00:13:17.116
of the girl's hands.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.944
And so I could play with the medium,

00:13:18.968 --> 00:13:21.896
and why I move from one medium to another

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.379
is to be able to do this.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.810
Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."

Circus, rock 'n' roll, drama.

00:15:51.915 --> 00:15:54.733
What the hell are we doing
up there on that stage?

00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:57.395
Well, one last story, very quickly.

00:15:57.419 --> 00:16:00.265
After I was in that village,
I crossed the lake,

00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:03.354
and I saw that the volcano was erupting

00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:05.107
on the other side, Gunung Batur,

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.192
and there was a dead volcano
next to the live volcano.

00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:10.455
I didn't think I'd be
swallowed by the volcano,

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:11.799
and I am here.

00:16:11.823 --> 00:16:15.736
But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.321
You hold on to the roots,

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:20.521
you put your foot in the little rocks

00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:23.103
and climb up there,
and you get to the top,

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:25.393
and I was with a good
friend who was an actor,

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:27.413
and we said, "Let's go up there.

00:16:27.437 --> 00:16:29.461
Let's see if we can come close to the edge

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:31.597
of that live volcano."

00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:34.449
And we climbed up and we got
to the very top,

00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:36.954
and we're on the edge, on this precipice,

00:16:36.978 --> 00:16:39.367
Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke

00:16:39.391 --> 00:16:41.304
at the volcano at the other end,

00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:43.146
and I'm up there alone

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.882
on this incredible precipice.

00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:47.503
Did you hear the lyrics?

00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:49.829
I'm on the precipice looking down

00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:52.140
into a dead volcano to my left.

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:55.968
To my right is sheer shale.
It's coming off.

00:16:55.992 --> 00:16:59.736
I'm in thongs and sarongs.
It was many years ago.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.361
And no hiking boots.

00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:05.320
And he's disappeared, this
mad French gypsy actor,

00:17:05.344 --> 00:17:08.624
off in the smoke, and I realize,

00:17:08.648 --> 00:17:12.552
I can't go back the way that I've come.
I can't.

00:17:12.576 --> 00:17:17.233
So I throw away my camera.
I throw away my thongs,

00:17:17.257 --> 00:17:20.462
and I looked at the line
straight in front of me,

00:17:20.486 --> 00:17:24.096
and I got down on all fours like a cat,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.117
and I held with my knees to either side

00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:29.511
of this line in front of me,

00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:32.553
for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.

00:17:32.577 --> 00:17:35.266
The wind was massively blowing,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.695
and the only way I could
get to the other side

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.139
was to look at the line
straight in front of me.

00:17:41.163 --> 00:17:43.142
I know you've all been there.

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.115
I'm in the crucible right now.

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:46.979
It's my trial by fire.

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:49.309
It's my company's trials by fire.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:53.566
We survive because our theme
song is "Rise Above."

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.707
Boy falls from the sky, rise above.

00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.121
It's right there in the palm
of both of our hands,

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:00.748
of all of my company's hands.

00:18:00.772 --> 00:18:04.316
I have beautiful collaborators,
and we as creators

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.327
only get there all together.

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.516
I know you understand that.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.941
And you just stay going forward,

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.582
and then you see this extraordinary thing

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:15.128
in front of your eyes.

00:18:15.152 --> 00:18:16.428
Thank you.

00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:21.899
(Applause)
