00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.516
Today, I want to tell you
about a pressing social issue.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.876
Now, it's not nuclear arms,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.476
it's not immigration,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.436
and it's not malaria.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.916
I'm here to talk about movies.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.500
Now, in all seriousness,
movies are actually really important.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.476
In film, we can be wildly entertained,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.820
and we can also be transported
through storytelling.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.116
Storytelling is so important.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.676
Stories tell us what societies value,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.676
they offer us lessons,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.876
and they share and preserve our history.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
Stories are amazing.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.196
But stories don't give everyone

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.676
the same opportunity
to appear within them,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.156
particularly not stories

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.316
compartmentalized
in the form of American movies.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.636
In film, interestingly enough,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.236
females are still erased and marginalized

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.316
in a lot of our stories.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.196
And I learned this for the first time
about 10 years ago

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.996
when I did my first study
on gender role in G-rated films.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.596
Since then, we've conducted
more than 30 investigations.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.476
My team is tired.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.876
And I've committed my life

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.396
as researcher and activist

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.116
to fighting the inclusion crisis

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.996
in Hollywood.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.516
So today, what I'd like to do
is tell you about that crisis.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.116
I want to talk about
gender inequality in film.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.516
I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.556
and then I'm going to tell you
how we're going to fix it.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.396
However, one caveat before I begin:

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.756
my data are really depressing.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.836
So I want to apologize in advance,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.996
because I'm going to put you all
in a really bad mood.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.396
But I'm going to bring it up at the end,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.276
and I'm going to present a silver lining

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.676
to fix this mess that we've been in

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.276
for a very, very long time.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.236
So, let's start with the gravity
of the situation.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.876
Each year, my research team
examines the top 100 grossing films

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.516
in the United States.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.756
What we do is we look at every speaking
or named character on-screen.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.716
Now, to count in one of my investigations,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.916
all a character has to do is say one word.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.516
This is a very low bar.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.996
(Laughter)

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.436
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.476
from 2007 to 2015,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.356
cataloguing every speaking character
on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.740
LGBT and characters with a disability.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.596
Let's take a look
at really some problematic trends.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.196
First, females are still
noticeably absent on-screen in film.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.556
Across 800 movies
and 35,205 speaking characters,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.276
less than a third of all roles
go to girls and women.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.596
Less than a third!

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.076
There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.529
and if you compare our results

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:19.196
to a small sample of films
from 1946 to 1955,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.516
there's been no change
in over a half of a century.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.916
Over half of a century!

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.556
But we're half of the population.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.396
Now, if we look at this data
intersectionally,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.556
which has been a focus of today,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.676
the picture becomes even more problematic.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.716
Across the top 100 films
of just last year,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.036
48 films didn't feature one black
or African-American speaking character,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.316
not one.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.556
70 films were devoid of Asian
or Asian-American speaking characters

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.996
that were girls or women.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.636
None.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.036
Eighty-four films didn't feature one
female character that had a disability.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.636
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual
or transgender female speaking characters.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.836
This is not underrepresentation.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.756
This is erasure,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.596
and I call this
the epidemic of invisibility.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.316
Now, when we move
from prevalence to protagonist,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.796
the story is still problematic.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.436
Out of a hundred films last year,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.076
only 32 featured a female lead
or colead driving the action.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.236
Only three out of a hundred films

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.036
featured an underrepresented
female driving the story,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.356
and only one diverse woman

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.116
that was 45 years of age or older
at the time of theatrical release.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.620
Now let's look at portrayal.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.676
In addition to the numbers you just saw,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.316
females are far more likely
to be sexualized in film

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.076
than their male counterparts.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.516
Matter of fact, they're about
three times as likely

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.556
to be shown in sexually
revealing clothing,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.796
partially naked,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.396
and they're far more likely to be thin.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.156
Now, sometimes, in animation,
females are so thin

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.836
that their waist size approximates
the circumference of their upper arm.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.516
(Laughter)

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.956
We like to say that these gals
have no room for a womb

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.556
or any other internal organ.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.596
(Laughter)

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.196
Now, all joking aside,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.156
theories suggest, research confirms,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.556
exposure to thin ideals
and objectifying content

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.396
can lead to body dissatisfaction,
internalization of the thin ideal

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.836
and self-objectification
among some female viewers.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.836
Obviously, what we see on-screen

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.836
and what we see in the world,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.596
they do not match.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.876
They do not match!

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.156
Matter of fact,
if we lived in the screen world,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.780
we would have a population
crisis on our hands.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.676
So, as soon as I recognized
these patterns,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.956
I wanted to find out why,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.876
and it turns out that there are
two drivers to inequality on-screen:

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.996
content creator gender
and misperceptions of the audience.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.756
Let's unpack them really quick.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.716
If you want to change
any of the patterns I just talked about,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.196
all you have to do
is hire female directors.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.236
Turns out, the female directors

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.756
are associated with,
in terms of short films and indie films,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.596
more girls and women on-screen,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.236
more stories with women in the center,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.796
more stories with women
40 years of age or older on-screen,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.716
which I think is good news for this crowd.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.676
More underrepresented --

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.036
(Laughter)

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.276
Sorry.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.076
(Laughter)

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.356
Sorry but not sorry.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.036
More underrepresented characters
in terms of race and ethnicity,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.356
and most importantly,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.756
more women working behind the camera

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.876
in key production roles.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.636
Easy answer to the problems
that we just talked about.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.876
Or is it?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.676
It's actually not.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.956
800 films, 2007-2015,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.556
886 directors.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.196
Only 4.1 percent are women.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.116
Only three are African-American or black,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.620
and only one woman was Asian.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.836
So why is it so difficult

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.636
to have female directors

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.316
if they're part of the solution?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.116
Well, to answer this question,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.340
we conducted a study.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.236
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.676
and asked them about directors.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.516
Turns out, both male
and female executives,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.196
when they think director,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.796
they think male.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.676
They perceive the traits of leadership

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.956
to be masculine in nature.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.156
So when they're going to hire a director

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.476
to command a crew, lead a ship,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.876
be a visionary or be General Patton,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.156
all the things that we've heard --

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.180
their thoughts and ideations pull male.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.116
The perception of director or a leader

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.796
is inconsistent
with the perception of a woman.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.836
The roles are incongruous,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.996
which is consistent with a lot of research
in the psychological arena.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.156
Second factor contributing
to inequality on-screen

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.756
is misperceptions of the audience.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.436
I don't need to tell this crowd:

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.716
50 percent of the people
that go to the box office and buy tickets

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.716
are girls and women in this country.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.956
Right?

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.316
But we're not perceived to be a viable
or financially lucrative target audience.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.556
Further, there's some misperceptions

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.676
about whether females can open a film.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.556
Open a film means that if you
place a female at the center,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.516
it doesn't have the return on investment

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.500
that if you place a male
at the center of a story does.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.916
This misperception is actually costly.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.156
Right?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.476
Especially in the wake
of franchise successes

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.596
like "The Hunger Games,"

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.836
"Pitch Perfect"

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.540
or that small little indie film,
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens."

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.036
Our own economic analyses show
that gender of the lead character

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.556
doesn't play a role in economic success
in the United States.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.876
But what does?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.756
Production costs alone

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.380
or in conjunction with how widely
a film is distributed in this country.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.300
It's not the gender of the lead character.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.156
So at this point, we should
all be sufficiently depressed.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.716
No change in 50 years,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.116
few female directors
working behind the camera

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.180
and the entertainment industry
does not trust us as an audience.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.436
Well, I told you
there would be a silver lining,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.660
and there is.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.796
There are actually
simple and tangible solutions

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.356
to fixing this problem

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.996
that involve content creators,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.236
executives and consumers

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.596
like the individuals in this room.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.516
Let's talk about a few of them.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.996
The first is what I call "just add five."

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.076
Did you know if we looked
at the top 100 films next year

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.316
and simply added five female
speaking characters on-screen

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.756
to each of those films,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.396
it would create a new norm.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.196
If we were to do this
for three contiguous years,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.236
we would be at gender parity

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.820
for the first time
in over a half of a century.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.716
Now, this approach is advantageous
for a variety of reasons.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.676
One? It doesn't take away jobs
for male actors.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.036
Heaven forbid.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.476
(Laughter)

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.436
Two, it's actually cost-effective.
It doesn't cost that much.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.356
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.996
And four, it humanizes
the production process.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.780
Why? Because it makes sure
that there's women on set.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.980
Second solution is for A-list talent.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.196
A-listers, as we all know,
can make demands in their contracts,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.916
particularly the ones that work
on the biggest Hollywood films.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.676
What if those A-listers

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.796
simply added an equity clause
or an inclusion rider

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.876
into their contract?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.836
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.556
Well, you probably don't know

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.916
but the typical feature film

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.620
has about 40 to 45
speaking characters in it.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.756
I would argue that only 8 to 10
of those characters

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.796
are actually relevant to the story.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.836
Except maybe "Avengers." Right?

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.540
A few more in "Avengers."

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.876
The remaining 30 or so roles,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.316
there's no reason why those minor roles

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.236
can't match or reflect the demography

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.460
of where the story is taking place.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.516
An equity rider by an A-lister
in their contract

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.956
can stipulate that those roles

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.276
reflect the world
in which we actually live.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.836
Now, there's no reason why a network,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.036
a studio or a production company

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.676
cannot adopt the same contractual language

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.516
in their negotiation processes.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.196
Third solution:

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.556
this would be for
the entertainment industry,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.796
Hollywood in particular,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.756
to adopt the Rooney Rule

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.436
when it comes to hiring practices
around directors.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.076
Now, in the NFL,
the Rooney Rule stipulates

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.956
that if a team wants to hire a coach
from outside the organization,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.916
what they have to do is interview
an underrepresented candidate.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.036
The exact same principle
can apply to Hollywood films.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.276
How?

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.756
Well, on these top films,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.236
executives and agents can make sure

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.476
that women and people of color
are not only on the consideration list,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.876
but they're actually
interviewed for the job.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.396
Now, one might say,

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.836
why is this important?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.076
Because it exposes or introduces
executives to female directors

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.540
who otherwise fall prey
to exclusionary hiring practices.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.716
The fourth solution

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.980
is for consumers like me and you.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.076
If we want to see more films
by, for and about women,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.780
we have to support them.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.796
It may mean going
to the independent theater chain

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.756
instead of the multiplex.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.276
Or it might mean scrolling down
a little further online

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.876
to find a film by a female director.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.756
Or it may be writing a check
and funding a film,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.276
particularly by a female director
from an underrepresented background.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.516
Right?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.196
We need to write, call and email companies

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.078
that are making and distributing films,

00:12:56.102 --> 00:12:58.996
and we need to post
on our social media accounts

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.116
when we want to see
inclusive representation,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.396
women on-screen,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.780
and most importantly,
women behind the camera.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.420
We need to make our voices heard
and our dollars count.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.780
Now, we actually have the ability
to change the world on this one.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.916
The US and its content,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.436
films in particular,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.476
have captured the imaginations
of audiences worldwide.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.700
Worldwide.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.036
So that means that the film industry
has unprecedented access

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.076
to be able to distribute
stories about equality

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.316
all around the world.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.236
Imagine what would happen

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.796
if the film industry aligned its values

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.540
with what it shows on-screen.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.196
It could foster inclusion

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.476
and acceptance for girls and women,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.996
people of color,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.876
the LGBT community,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.676
individuals with disabilities,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.620
and so many more around the world.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:11.876
The only thing that the film industry
has to do is unleash its secret weapon,

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.180
and that's storytelling.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.516
Now, at the beginning of this talk,

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.956
I said that films --

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.516
that they can actually transport us,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.900
but I would like to argue
that films, they can transform us.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.476
None of us in this room

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.756
have grown up or experienced
a storytelling landscape

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.276
with fully realized female characters,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.796
none of us,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.556
because the numbers haven't changed.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.676
What would happen
if the next generation of audiences

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.076
grew up with a whole
different screen reality?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.356
What would happen?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.356
Well I'm here to tell you today

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.436
that it's not only possible
to change what we see on-screen

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.540
but I am impatient for it to get here.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.516
So let's agree to take action today

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.140
to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.076
And let's agree to take action today

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.516
to agree that US audiences
and global viewers

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.676
demand and deserve more.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.276
And let's agree today

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.476
that the next generation
of viewers and audiences,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.676
that they deserve to see the stories

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.836
we were never able to see.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.076
Thank you.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.824
(Applause)
