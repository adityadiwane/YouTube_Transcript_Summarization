00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:15.133
How many of you have checked your email today?

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.029
Come on, raise your hands.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.160
How many of you are checking it right now?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.718
(Laughter)

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:23.218
And how about finances? Anybody check that today?

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:25.706
Credit card, investment account?

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:29.659
How about this week?

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.776
Now, how about your household energy use?

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.714
Anybody check that today?

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:38.866
This week? Last week?

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.994
A few energy geeks spread out across the room.

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:44.563
It's good to see you guys.

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:47.798
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.780
who are passionate about the future of this planet,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.611
and even we aren't paying attention

00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:55.571
to the energy use that's driving climate change.

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:58.226
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:00.763
We met her on our first family vacation.

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.125
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.985
and she is decidedly not an energy geek.

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:11.224
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:13.253
This is coal,

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:16.610
the most common source of electricity on the planet,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.834
and there's enough energy in this coal

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:23.786
to light this bulb for more than a year.

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:25.857
But unfortunately, between here and here,

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:27.289
most of that energy is lost to things

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.174
like transmission leakage and heat.

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.753
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:37.761
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.370
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.408
you'd need this much coal.

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:48.452
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,

00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:50.525
we waste nine.

00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:52.156
That means there's good news,

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:54.739
because for every unit of energy we save,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.004
we save the other nine.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:03.285
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.266
and across the globe to start paying attention

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.352
to the energy we're using,

00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:11.328
and start wasting less of it?

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:13.715
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:17.096
that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:19.232
and only 90 miles from here,

00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:22.608
in San Marcos, California.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.289
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.110
asking people to turn off their air conditioning

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.320
and turn on their fans.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.608
One quarter of the homes received a message that said,

00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:34.926
did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:36.744
Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:38.578
Another group got an environmental message.

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:40.667
And still a third group got a message about

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.347
being good citizens, preventing blackouts.

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:47.064
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.

00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:49.677
In fact, none of these messages worked.

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:52.533
They had zero impact on energy consumption.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:56.654
It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:58.474
But there was a fourth message,

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:00.597
and this message simply said,

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.507
"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors

00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:06.997
said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.

00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:08.802
Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:10.063
and turn on your fans."

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:12.760
And wouldn't you know it, they did.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.714
The people who received this message

00:03:14.714 --> 00:03:17.236
showed a marked decrease in energy consumption

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:20.647
simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.347
So what does this tell us?

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.564
Well, if something is inconvenient,

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.553
even if we believe in it,

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:30.431
moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us --

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:34.101
but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.719
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.884
In fact, it already is.

00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:42.516
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I

00:03:42.516 --> 00:03:44.692
started a company called Opower.

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:47.161
We built software and partnered with utility companies

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.964
who wanted to help their customers save energy.

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:53.030
We deliver personalized home energy reports

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.748
that show people how their consumption

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:57.620
compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.860
Just like those effective door hangers,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.324
we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,

00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:04.840
and then we give everyone targeted recommendations

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.490
to help them save.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.796
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:11.725
web, and now even a controllable thermostat,

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:13.742
and for the last five years we've been running

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:18.145
the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:19.809
And it's working.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.906
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:25.046
more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.559
and we're just getting started.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.819
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.073
in six countries, we're going to generate

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:35.225
another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.266
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.305
but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.644
is more than enough energy to power every home

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:45.938
in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:47.506
for more than a year.

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:49.472
Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half

00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:52.058
what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.649
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.806
we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:02.802
every minute around the clock every day for an entire year

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.906
to get two terawatt hours of electricity.

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:06.223
And we're not burning anything.

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.951
We're just motivating people to pay attention

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.964
and change their behavior.

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.254
But we're just one company, and this is just

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:15.391
scratching the surface.

00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:18.956
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.960
and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.313
inefficient lightbulbs. They may.

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:27.457
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,

00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:30.487
and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.

00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:33.571
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted

00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.820
on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.467
but does contribute to climate change.

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.587
That's 40 billion -- with a B --

00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:43.870
every year in the U.S. alone.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.235
That's half our coal usage right there.

00:05:47.235 --> 00:05:50.007
Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists

00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:53.513
are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources

00:05:53.513 --> 00:05:54.651
like these,

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:58.149
and this is both fantastic and essential.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.187
But the most overlooked resource to get us

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:03.733
to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:08.389
It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.073
And we can harness this resource

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.910
with no new material science

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.102
simply by applying behavioral science.

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.186
We can do it today, we know it works,

00:06:18.186 --> 00:06:21.914
and it will save us money right away.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.665
So what are we waiting for?

00:06:24.665 --> 00:06:27.392
Well, in most places, utility regulation

00:06:27.392 --> 00:06:31.708
hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.638
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers

00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:36.202
waste energy.

00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:40.005
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:43.411
But this story is much more than about household energy use.

00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:45.473
Take a look at the Prius.

00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:48.495
It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science

00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:50.970
but because they invested in behavioral science.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.110
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.074
they're saving in real time

00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:56.589
makes former speed demons

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.342
drive more like cautious grandmothers.

00:06:59.342 --> 00:07:01.906
Which brings us back to Harriet.

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:04.094
We met her on our first family vacation.

00:07:04.094 --> 00:07:06.281
She came over to meet my young daughter,

00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:08.452
and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name

00:07:08.452 --> 00:07:10.506
is also Harriet.

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:11.931
She asked me what I did for a living,

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.476
and I told her, I work with utilities

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.352
to help people save energy.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.578
It was then that her eyes lit up.

00:07:17.578 --> 00:07:19.510
She looked at me, and she said,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.738
"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.

00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:23.921
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter

00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:26.241
in the mail from our utility.

00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:29.439
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:32.869
(Laughter)

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.689
"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.977
talk about, and even argue about,

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.697
is what we should be doing to save energy.

00:07:39.697 --> 00:07:42.562
We did everything that letter told us to do,

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:45.364
and still I know there must be more.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.042
Now I'm here with a genuine expert.

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:51.801
Tell me. What should I do to save energy?"

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.853
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.

00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:57.915
My goal is to make sure

00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.213
we are all asking it.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.571
Thank you.

00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:06.174
(Applause)
