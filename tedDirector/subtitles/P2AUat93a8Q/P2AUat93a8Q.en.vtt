00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:14.349
Why do we cheat?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.928
And why do happy people cheat?

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:25.447
And when we say "infidelity,"
what exactly do we mean?

00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:32.586
Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room,

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:34.625
a massage with a happy ending?

00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:41.494
Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.256
but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy?

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.999
And is an affair always
the end of a relationship?

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.490
For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.535
and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:01.722
who have been shattered by infidelity.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.602
There is one simple act of transgression

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:10.990
that can rob a couple
of their relationship,

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:15.245
their happiness and their
very identity: an affair.

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:21.117
And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood.

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.224
So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved.

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:33.525
Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented,

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.070
and so, too, the taboo against it.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:42.827
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy,

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:46.285
so much so, that this is
the only commandment

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.221
that is repeated twice in the Bible:

00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.325
once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.595
(Laughter)

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.922
So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden,

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:03.367
yet universally practiced?

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:10.036
Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:12.331
with little consequence,

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.739
and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.315
that justified their need to roam,

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:23.292
so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself.

00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:29.716
But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.752
Because when it comes to sex,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.939
the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate,

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.484
but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny,

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:45.710
which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.234
where women can be killed for straying.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:54.420
Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life.

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:57.515
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:00.133
(Laughter)

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:02.023
(Applause)

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:06.300
I mean, many of you probably have said,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.888
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.863
(Laughter)

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:14.260
We used to marry,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.169
and had sex for the first time.

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.076
But now we marry,

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:20.003
and we stop having sex with others.

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.677
The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love.

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:28.895
Men relied on women's fidelity

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.959
in order to know whose children these are,

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.300
and who gets the cows when I die.

00:03:36.205 --> 00:03:38.655
Now, everyone wants to know

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:40.403
what percentage of people cheat.

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:43.634
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.236
(Laughter)

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.640
It applies to you.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:52.959
But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding:

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.021
sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps.

00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:02.817
So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition

00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:05.956
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:11.586
estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent.

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:15.959
But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:19.792
So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:22.969
for our partner to lie
about having an affair,

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.190
but just about the same
amount of us will say

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:28.348
that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:30.808
(Laughter)

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:35.577
Now, I like this definition
of an affair --

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:39.326
it brings together the three key elements:

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:45.032
a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair;

00:04:45.032 --> 00:04:49.826
an emotional connection
to one degree or another;

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:51.466
and a sexual alchemy.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.337
And alchemy is the key word here,

00:04:55.337 --> 00:05:02.265
because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving,

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:05.349
can be as powerful and as enchanting

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.839
as hours of actual lovemaking.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.315
As Marcel Proust said,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.640
it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person.

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:21.758
So it's never been easier to cheat,

00:05:21.762 --> 00:05:25.235
and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.459
And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll.

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:35.342
When marriage was an economic enterprise,

00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:38.308
infidelity threatened
our economic security.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.959
But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement,

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.779
infidelity threatens
our emotional security.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.040
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.269
that was the space where
we sought pure love.

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:55.482
But now that we seek love in marriage,

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:57.142
adultery destroys it.

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:03.347
Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.613
We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person

00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:14.810
to fulfill an endless list of needs:

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.410
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.563
the best parent, my trusted confidant,

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:24.657
my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal.

00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:29.929
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:33.245
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:34.435
I'm the one.

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:38.514
And infidelity tells me I'm not.

00:06:39.308 --> 00:06:41.197
It is the ultimate betrayal.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.125
Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.561
But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful,

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.919
today it is often traumatic,

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.720
because it threatens our sense of self.

00:06:57.054 --> 00:06:59.823
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:02.595
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:06.801
I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.022
Now, I question everything."

00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:14.819
Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.124
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

00:07:17.148 --> 00:07:19.450
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:23.905
And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me,

00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:26.532
when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick.

00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:27.982
Married, two kids.

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:30.659
Nick just left on a business trip,

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:34.190
and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.127
when she sees a message
appear on the screen:

00:07:37.127 --> 00:07:38.665
"Can't wait to see you."

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.054
Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other.

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:44.379
And then another message:

00:07:44.903 --> 00:07:47.140
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.243
And Heather realizes

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:51.611
these are not for her.

00:07:52.435 --> 00:07:55.808
She also tells me
that her father had affairs,

00:07:55.812 --> 00:07:59.753
but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket,

00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:01.935
and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar.

00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:06.610
Heather, she goes digging,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.673
and she finds hundreds of messages,

00:08:09.673 --> 00:08:13.086
and photos exchanged
and desires expressed.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.118
The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair

00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:19.300
unfold in front of her in real time,

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.272
And it made me think:

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:26.318
Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts.

00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:31.113
But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days.

00:08:31.113 --> 00:08:33.417
Because of this romantic ideal,

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:38.475
we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor.

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:42.544
But we also have never
been more inclined to stray,

00:08:42.544 --> 00:08:45.255
and not because we have new desires today,

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:47.001
but because we live in an era

00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:50.682
where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires,

00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:54.138
because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:59.031
And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy,

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.864
today we divorce
because we could be happier.

00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:06.847
And if divorce carried all the shame,

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:10.738
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

00:09:10.738 --> 00:09:12.102
is the new shame.

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:15.168
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends

00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:18.429
because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick,

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:21.977
and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice:

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.602
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

00:09:25.744 --> 00:09:30.737
And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.364
Staying is the new shame.

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:38.359
So if we can divorce,

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:40.455
why do we still have affairs?

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:46.563
Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats,

00:09:46.563 --> 00:09:50.408
either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.686
But millions of people
can't all be pathological.

00:09:56.383 --> 00:10:00.291
The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home,

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.715
then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere,

00:10:03.715 --> 00:10:07.182
assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage

00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:10.038
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:14.499
But what if passion
has a finite shelf life?

00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:19.338
What if there are things
that even a good relationship

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:20.743
can never provide?

00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:25.202
If even happy people cheat,

00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:26.798
what is it about?

00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:31.641
The vast majority of people
that I actually work with

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:34.425
are not at all chronic philanderers.

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:38.475
They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs,

00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:40.048
and at least for their partner.

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:43.501
But they find themselves in a conflict

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:46.540
between their values and their behavior.

00:10:47.572 --> 00:10:51.935
They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades,

00:10:51.935 --> 00:10:54.574
but one day they cross a line

00:10:54.574 --> 00:10:57.047
that they never thought they would cross,

00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:59.794
and at the risk of losing everything.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.635
But for a glimmer of what?

00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:06.609
Affairs are an act of betrayal,

00:11:06.609 --> 00:11:09.705
and they are also an expression
of longing and loss.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.528
At the heart of an affair,
you will often find

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:18.789
a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection,

00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:24.559
for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.226
a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves

00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:33.540
or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.

00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:37.766
I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya,

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:40.382
who is blissfully married,

00:11:40.382 --> 00:11:41.847
loves her husband,

00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:44.230
and would never want to hurt the man.

00:11:44.713 --> 00:11:46.831
But she also tells me

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.005
that she's always done
what was expected of her:

00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:53.685
good girl, good wife, good mother,

00:11:53.685 --> 00:11:56.677
taking care of her immigrant parents.

00:11:56.677 --> 00:12:01.189
Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard

00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:02.675
after Hurricane Sandy.

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:08.087
And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her.

00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:14.769
But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had.

00:12:15.753 --> 00:12:21.030
And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.748
it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from,

00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:28.585
but the person that
we have ourselves become.

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:33.274
And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person,

00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:36.816
as much as we are
looking for another self.

00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:40.602
Now, all over the world,

00:12:40.602 --> 00:12:44.458
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.911
They feel alive.

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:52.286
And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses --

00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:54.141
of a parent who died,

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.341
and a friend that went too soon,

00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:58.141
and bad news at the doctor.

00:12:59.482 --> 00:13:04.138
Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair,

00:13:04.138 --> 00:13:06.608
because they raise these questions.

00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:09.536
Is this it? Is there more?

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:12.957
Am I going on for another
25 years like this?

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.362
Will I ever feel that thing again?

00:13:18.377 --> 00:13:22.788
And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:25.947
are the ones that propel
people to cross the line,

00:13:25.947 --> 00:13:29.939
and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness,

00:13:29.939 --> 00:13:31.735
in an antidote to death.

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:36.867
And contrary to what you may think,

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:41.903
affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire:

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:45.392
desire for attention,
desire to feel special,

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.308
desire to feel important.

00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:51.247
And the very structure of an affair,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.499
the fact that you can
never have your lover,

00:13:53.503 --> 00:13:54.938
keeps you wanting.

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:57.959
That in itself is a desire machine,

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:00.747
because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

00:14:00.747 --> 00:14:03.522
keeps you wanting
that which you can't have.

00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:07.177
Now some of you probably think

00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:10.807
that affairs don't happen
in open relationships,

00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:11.998
but they do.

00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:15.562
First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same

00:14:15.562 --> 00:14:17.743
as the conversation about infidelity.

00:14:18.468 --> 00:14:21.959
But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.632
the freedom to have other sexual partners,

00:14:24.632 --> 00:14:28.720
we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.207
that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do,

00:14:32.207 --> 00:14:35.006
then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to.

00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:40.935
And I've also told
quite a few of my patients

00:14:40.935 --> 00:14:45.536
that if they could bring
into their relationships

00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:49.167
one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:50.879
that they put into their affairs,

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:53.124
they probably would never need to see me.

00:14:53.148 --> 00:14:55.148
(Laughter)

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:58.647
So how do we heal from an affair?

00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:02.347
Desire runs deep.

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:04.242
Betrayal runs deep.

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:06.821
But it can be healed.

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:10.920
And some affairs are death knells

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:13.682
for relationships that were
already dying on the vine.

00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:17.769
But others will jolt us
into new possibilities.

00:15:17.953 --> 00:15:19.936
The fact is, the majority of couples

00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:22.150
who have experienced
affairs stay together.

00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:25.399
But some of them will merely survive,

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:30.103
and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

00:15:30.817 --> 00:15:34.460
They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience.

00:15:34.484 --> 00:15:38.198
And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner,

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:39.558
who will often say,

00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:41.365
"You think I didn't want more?

00:15:41.365 --> 00:15:43.207
But I'm not the one who did it."

00:15:43.968 --> 00:15:46.110
But now that the affair is exposed,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.244
they, too, get to claim more,

00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:50.886
and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo

00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:53.800
that may not have been working
for them that well, either.

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:59.110
I've noticed that a lot of couples,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.251
in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:05.587
because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order,

00:16:05.587 --> 00:16:09.169
will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.824
that they haven't had in decades.

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:14.680
And, partners who were
sexually indifferent

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.279
find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious,

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.814
they don't know where it's coming from.

00:16:20.568 --> 00:16:24.521
Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire,

00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:27.840
and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth.

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:33.004
So when an affair is exposed,

00:16:33.004 --> 00:16:36.165
what are some of the specific things
that couples can do?

00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:42.204
We know from trauma that healing begins

00:16:42.204 --> 00:16:46.196
when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:51.050
So for the partner who had the affair,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.582
for Nick,

00:16:52.582 --> 00:16:54.387
one thing is to end the affair,

00:16:54.387 --> 00:16:59.109
but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing

00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:02.315
guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.264
But the truth is

00:17:04.264 --> 00:17:07.365
that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:10.463
may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner,

00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:13.676
but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself.

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:15.976
And that distinction is important.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.856
And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship.

00:17:21.253 --> 00:17:24.326
He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries.

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:26.949
It's his responsibility to bring it up,

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.929
because if he thinks about it,

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:31.939
he can relieve Heather from the obsession,

00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:35.149
and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten,

00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:38.332
and that in itself
begins to restore trust.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.429
But for Heather,

00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:43.174
or deceived partners,

00:17:43.174 --> 00:17:48.512
it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth,

00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:52.245
to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities

00:17:52.249 --> 00:17:55.652
that give back joy
and meaning and identity.

00:17:55.936 --> 00:17:57.869
But even more important,

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:02.772
is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details --

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:04.969
Where were you? Where did you do it?

00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:07.991
How often? Is she better
than me in bed? --

00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:10.475
questions that only inflict more pain,

00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:11.959
and keep you awake at night.

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:17.350
And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.650
the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives --

00:18:20.654 --> 00:18:23.127
What did this affair mean for you?

00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:25.899
What were you able to express
or experience there

00:18:25.899 --> 00:18:28.154
that you could no longer do with me?

00:18:28.154 --> 00:18:31.186
What was it like for you
when you came home?

00:18:31.186 --> 00:18:34.585
What is it about us that you value?

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:36.737
Are you pleased this is over?

00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:42.725
Every affair will redefine a relationship,

00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:45.607
and every couple will determine

00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:48.142
what the legacy of the affair will be.

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:53.411
But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away.

00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:56.959
And the dilemmas of love and desire,

00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:02.929
they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad,

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:04.903
and victim and perpetrator.

00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:10.296
Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms.

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:12.650
There are many ways
that we betray our partner:

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.819
with contempt, with neglect,

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:17.292
with indifference, with violence.

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:21.437
Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner.

00:19:21.437 --> 00:19:24.041
In other words, the victim of an affair

00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:26.983
is not always the victim of the marriage.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.048
Now, you've listened to me,

00:19:32.048 --> 00:19:34.423
and I know what you're thinking:

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:38.197
She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair.

00:19:38.697 --> 00:19:41.999
(Laughter)

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.265
So, you're wrong.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.174
I am not French.

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:50.119
(Laughter)

00:19:50.143 --> 00:19:53.023
(Applause)

00:19:53.602 --> 00:19:55.269
And I'm not pro-affair.

00:19:56.674 --> 00:20:01.058
But because I think that good
can come out of an affair,

00:20:01.058 --> 00:20:04.389
I have often been asked
this very strange question:

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:06.150
Would I ever recommend it?

00:20:07.514 --> 00:20:10.505
Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:13.049
than I would recommend you have cancer,

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:15.752
and yet we know that people
who have been ill

00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:19.950
often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective.

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:23.906
The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:27.417
when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against?

00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:29.749
I said, "Yes."

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:32.583
(Laughter)

00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:37.505
I look at affairs from a dual perspective:

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:41.153
hurt and betrayal on one side,

00:20:41.153 --> 00:20:44.509
growth and self-discovery on the other --

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:47.605
what it did to you,
and what it meant for me.

00:20:48.621 --> 00:20:53.289
And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair

00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:55.092
that has been revealed,

00:20:55.092 --> 00:20:57.420
I will often tell them this:

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.825
Today in the West,

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:04.704
most of us are going to have
two or three relationships

00:21:04.704 --> 00:21:06.403
or marriages,

00:21:06.403 --> 00:21:09.538
and some of us are going
to do it with the same person.

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:12.911
Your first marriage is over.

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:16.474
Would you like to create
a second one together?

00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:18.595
Thank you.

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:25.253
(Applause)
