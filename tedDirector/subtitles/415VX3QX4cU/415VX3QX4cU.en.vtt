00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
On the 30th of May, 1832,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
a gunshot was heard

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.330
(Gunshot)

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
A peasant, who was walking to market that morning,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
ran towards where the gunshot had come from,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
clearly shot by a dueling wound.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
The young man's name was Evariste Galois.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
Galois was taken to the local hospital

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
where he died the next day in the arms of his brother.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
And the last words he said to his brother were,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
"Don't cry for me, Alfred.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
I need all the courage I can muster

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.330
to die at the age of 20."

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
for which Galois was famous.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
But a few years earlier, while still at school,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
problems at the time.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
trying to explain his theory.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.330
(Laughter)

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
So, the night before that duel, he realized

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
this possibly is his last chance

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
to try and explain his great breakthrough.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
So he stayed up the whole night, writing away,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
trying to explain his ideas.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.330
he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
But contained inside those documents

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
was a new language, a language to understand

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
one of the most fundamental concepts

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
of science -- namely symmetry.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
It helps us to understand so many

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
different bits of the scientific world.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
For example, molecular structure.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
What crystals are possible,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
because they are generally rather nasty.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
to be able to propagate itself so well.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
because it actually communicates genetic information.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
you're probably drawn to the lower two.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
Because it is hard to make symmetry.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
and therefore you'll make a good mate.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
genetic information.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Symmetry can also help us to explain

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
we might see there,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
in a higher dimensional space.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
the power of mathematics

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
to understand the scientific world around us.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
He wrote, "The universe cannot be read

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
until we have learnt the language

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
It is written in mathematical language,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
without which means it is humanly impossible

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
to comprehend a single word."

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
Artists too love to play around with symmetry.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
He has a character describing the snowflake,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
found it deathly, the very marrow of death."

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
of symmetry and then break them.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
And a beautiful example of this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
in Japan, Professor Kurokawa.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
And the gateway you see behind

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
Seven of them are exactly the same,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
and the eighth one is turned upside down.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
And I said to Professor Kurokawa,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down."

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
And he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act."

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
in which the essayist wrote, "In everything,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
uniformity is undesirable.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Even when building the Imperial Palace,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
they always leave one place unfinished.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
But if I had to choose one building in the world

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.330
being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
This is a palace celebrating symmetry.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
Recently I took my family --

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
This is my son Tamer. You can see

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
But I wanted to try and enrich him.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
I think one of the problems about school mathematics

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
in the world we live in.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
So, I wanted to open his eyes up to

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
You see it already. Immediately you go in,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
the reflective symmetry in the water.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
to draw things with souls.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
So they explored a more geometric art.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
And so what is symmetry?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
do they have the same symmetries?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
Can we say whether they discovered

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
And it was Galois who produced a language

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
to be able to answer some of these questions.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
which was something still and deathly --

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
What can you do to a symmetrical object,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
move it in some way, so it looks the same

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
as before you moved it?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
What can you do to something? You close your eyes.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
I do something, put it back down again.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
It looks like it did before it started.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
rotate them by 90 degrees,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
inside the Alhambra.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
But it's also about producing a language to describe this.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
And the power of mathematics is often

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.330
to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
so brace yourselves --

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
push you a little bit to understand how this language works,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
which enables us to capture what is symmetry.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and still it looks like it did before I started.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
I could rotate it by a third of a turn,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
or a half a turn,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
that make it look like it did before I started.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
Can anybody think what else I could do to this

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
which would leave it like I did before I started?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
It's got no reflective symmetry.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
But what I could do is just leave it where it is,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
pick it up, and put it down again.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
Actually, the invention of the number zero

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
It seems mad to talk about nothing.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
So, this object has six symmetries.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
And what about the triangle?

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
or a third of a turn anticlockwise.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
I can reflect it in the line through X,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
or the line through Y,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
or the line through Z.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
So both of these objects have six symmetries.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
and you have to do some mathematics

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
in order to really understand it.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
So here is a little question for you.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
for the person who gets closest to the answer.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
The Rubik's Cube.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
How many things can I do to this object

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
and put it down so it still looks like a cube?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
and count how many symmetries there are.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.330
But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
but how they interact with each other

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.330
which really characterizes the symmetry of an object.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
If I do one magic trick move followed by another,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
the combination is a third magic trick move.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And here we see Galois starting to develop

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
a language to see the substance

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
of the symmetry underlying this physical object.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
For example, what if I turn the starfish

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
by a sixth of a turn,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
and then a third of a turn?

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.330
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
are the names for the rotations.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
to the B on the starfish. And so on.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
followed by C, which is a third of a turn?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
followed by a third of a turn,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.330
the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
So the little table here records

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
how the algebra of these symmetries work.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
I do one followed by another, the answer is

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
it's rotation D, half a turn.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.330
Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Of course, it doesn't make any difference.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
It still ends up at half a turn.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.330
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
with the triangle, one after the other.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and reflect in the line through X.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
to start with.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
Now, let's do it in a different order.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
Let's do the reflection in X first,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.330
followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
Now it matters what order you do the operations in.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And this enables us to distinguish

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
why the symmetries of these objects --

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
they have the same symmetries?

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
But the way the symmetries interact

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
enable us -- we've now got a language

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
then flip it. And then do it in the other order,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.330
and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.330
Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
It's almost like little Sudoku tables.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
You don't see any symmetry twice

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
in any row or column.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
And, using those rules, he was able to say

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
that there are in fact only two objects

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
with six symmetries.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
I think this is an amazing development.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
In the front here, I've got one, two, three people

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
sitting on one, two, three chairs.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.330
The people and the chairs are very different,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
Here are two very different walls,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
very different geometric pictures.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
But, using the language of Galois,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
are actually the same.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
For example, let's take this beautiful wall

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
with the triangles with a little twist on them.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
around the point where all the triangles meet.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
and everything matches up.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
where I can rotate by 180 degrees.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.330
And all the tiles match up again.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.330
So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
And although these walls look very different,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Galois has produced a language to say

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Here is another example in the Alhambra.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.330
that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Now, this power of the language is even more,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
because Galois can say,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
on the walls in the Alhambra?"

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
And it turns out they almost did.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
You can prove, using Galois' language,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
there are actually only 17

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.330
different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:14.330
it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
But these are things that we can see.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
And the power of Galois' mathematical language

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
is it also allows us to create

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
symmetrical objects in the unseen world,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.330
And that's where I work. I create

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
mathematical objects, symmetrical objects,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
using Galois' language,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
in very high dimensional spaces.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
So I think it's a great example of things unseen,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.330
which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.330
creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
and I've got a picture of it here.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
at the side here, great, excellent.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.330
Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
a picture of this symmetrical object.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
But here is the language which describes

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
how the symmetries interact.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
Now, this new symmetrical object

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
does not have a name yet.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
Now, people like getting their names on things,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
on craters on the moon

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
or new species of animals.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.330
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
which hasn't been named before.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
And this thing -- species die away,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
but this mathematical object will live forever.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
It will make you immortal.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.330
In order to win this symmetrical object,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
Okay, I'm going to sort you out.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
in that number. Okay?

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
Okay, now if you want to play,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
I want you to stand up, okay?

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
right -- we've already got one competitor here.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
If you all stay down he wins it automatically.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.330
Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
because you've underestimated.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.330
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
You've overestimated.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.330
20 digits or less, sit down.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.330
How many digits are there in your number?

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
Two? So you should have sat down earlier.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.330
(Laughter)

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.330
Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
If I told you 20 or less, stand up.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
Because this one. I think there were a few here.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.330
The people who just last sat down.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:50.330
Okay, how many digits do you have in your number?

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.330
(Laughs)

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
18. So it goes to this lady here.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
21 is the closest.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
has 25 digits.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
So now I need to name this object.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
So, what is your name?

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
spell it for me.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:20.330
G-H-E-Z

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.330
No, SO2 has already been used, actually,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.330
in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.330
So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
You are now immortal.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:34.330
(Applause)

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
And if you'd like your own symmetrical object,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.330
I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.330
where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.330
for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.330
And I think what drives me, as a mathematician,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.330
are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.330
It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.330
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness":

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.330
"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.330
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:16.330
(Applause)
