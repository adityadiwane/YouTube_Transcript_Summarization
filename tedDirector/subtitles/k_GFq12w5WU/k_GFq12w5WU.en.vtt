00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
If I could reveal anything

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
that is hidden from us,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
at least in modern cultures,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.330
it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
that we used to know

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.330
as well as we knew our own names.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And that is that we live in a competent universe,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
that we are part of a brilliant planet,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
and that we are surrounded by genius.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
Biomimicry is a new discipline

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
that tries to learn from those geniuses,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
and take advice from them, design advice.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
That's where I live,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
and it's my university as well.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.330
I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.330
remember the organisms and the ecosystems

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.330
that know how to live here gracefully on this planet.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
This is what I would tell you to remember

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
if you ever forget this again.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Remember this.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
This is what happens every year.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
This is what keeps its promise.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Spring.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Imagine designing spring.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
Imagine that orchestration.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.330
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
Imagine the timing, the coordination,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
all without top-down laws,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
or policies, or climate change protocols.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
This happens every year.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
There is lots of showing off.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
There is lots of love in the air.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.330
There's lots of grand openings.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
And the organisms, I promise you,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
have all of their priorities in order.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
because he's living, usually on his back,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
looking up at those grasses.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
And one time he came up to me --

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
And there was a wasp's nest

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
that I had let grow in my yard,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
right outside my door.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
And most people knock them down when they're small.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
But it was fascinating to me,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And he came up to me and he knocked.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
He would come every day with something to show me.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And he asked me

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.330
how I had made the house for those wasps,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
because he had never seen one this big.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
And I told him, "You know, Cody,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
the wasps actually made that."

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
And we looked at it together.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And I could see why he thought,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
you know -- it was so beautifully done.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
It was so architectural. It was so precise.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
But it occurred to me, how in his small life

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
had he already believed the myth

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.330
that if something was that well done,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
that we must have done it.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
How did he not know --

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
it's what we've all forgotten --

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
that we're not the first ones to build.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
We're not the first ones to process cellulose.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
to try to optimize packing space,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.330
We're not the first ones to build houses for our young.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
is that people are beginning to remember

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that organisms, other organisms,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
the rest of the natural world,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.330
are doing things very similar to what we need to do.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
But in fact they are doing them in a way

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
for billions of years.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
So these people, biomimics,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
are nature's apprentices.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And they're focusing on function.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
that they're learning.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
They have asked themselves,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
"What if, every time I started to invent something,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
And here is what they're learning.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
They're the people who make the bullet train.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
It was called the bullet train

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
because it was rounded in front,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
but every time it went into a tunnel

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
it would build up a pressure wave,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
So the engineer's boss said,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
"Find a way to quiet this train."

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
He happened to be a birder.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.330
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
the air, into another density of medium, water,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
without a splash. Look at this picture.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Without a splash, so they can see the fish.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
And he thought, "What if we do this?"

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
Quieted the train.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
How does nature repel bacteria?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
from some bacteria.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.330
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
And it's not because it goes fast.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
It doesn't do it with a chemical.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.330
that you had on Speedo bathing suits,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
that broke all those records in the Olympics,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
but it's a particular kind of pattern.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
on its skin denticles

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
to keep bacteria from landing,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.330
which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
more people every year in the United States

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.330
than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined --

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
about 100,000.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
It has no fresh water that it's able to drink,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
but it drinks water out of fog.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And those bumps act like a magnet for water.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
who studied this, Andrew Parker.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.330
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
are starting to look at this as a way

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
of coating buildings

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
so that they gather water from the fog.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.330
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
CO2 as a building block.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
Plants and organisms that make shells,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
coral, think of it as a building block.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
There is now a cement manufacturing company

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
starting in the United States called Calera.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
and they're using CO2 as a building block

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
in cement, in concrete.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
Instead of -- cement usually

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
Now it's reversing that equation,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
thanks to the recipe from the coral.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
None of these are using the organisms.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
from the organisms.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
How does nature gather the sun's energy?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
This is a new kind of solar cell

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
that's based on how a leaf works.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
It's self-assembling.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
It's extremely inexpensive

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
and rechargeable every five years.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
with Paul Hawken.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
There are many many ways that nature filters water

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
that takes salt out of water.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
We take water and push it against a membrane.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
and why it takes so much electricity.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Nature does something much more elegant.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
And it's in every cell.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
Every red blood cell of your body right now

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
has these hourglass-shaped pores

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
called aquaporins.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
They actually export water molecules through.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
It's kind of a forward osmosis.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
They export water molecules through,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and leave solutes on the other side.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.330
membranes mimicking this technology.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.330
Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
along lines of stress.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
This algorithm has been put into a software program

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
that's now being used to make bridges lightweight,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
to make building beams lightweight.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
Actually G.M. Opel used it

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.330
to create that skeleton you see,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
in what's called their bionic car.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
as an organism must,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.330
for the maximum amount of strength.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.330
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.330
this beetle uses one material, chitin.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
And it finds many many ways

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
to put many functions into it.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It's waterproof.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
It's strong and resilient.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.330
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.330
Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
One of our major inventions

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
that we need to be able to do

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
to come even close to what these organisms can do

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
is to find a way

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
and to add design to it.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
We use five polymers in the natural world

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
to do everything that you see.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
In our world we use about 350 polymers

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.330
to make all this.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Nature is nano.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.330
Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
is that not many people have been asking,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.330
"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
Nature has been doing that for a long time.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.330
Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
as part of their synthesis,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
they will emit, as a byproduct,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
nanoparticles into the water.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
But then right after that, they emit a protein

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.330
so that they fall out of solution.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.330
Energy use. Organisms sip energy,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.330
because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
And one of the largest fields right now,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
in the world of energy grids,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
you hear about the smart grid.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
They are looking at how ants and bees

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
find their food and their flowers

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
in the most effective way

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
as a whole hive.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And they're having appliances in your home

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
talk to one another through that algorithm,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:40.330
and determine how to minimize peak power use.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
There's a group of scientists in Cornell

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
that are making what they call a synthetic tree,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
It's capillary action and transpiration pulls

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
water up, a drop at a time,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.330
pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.330
They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:13.330
to move water up without pumps.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
some of these species --

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.330
create 600 volts of electricity

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
with the chemicals that are in your body.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
Even more interesting to me is that

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
600 volts doesn't fry it.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
with PVC for insulation.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
These organisms, how are they insulating

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
against their own electric charge?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
These are some questions that we've yet to ask.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
And those scalloped edges

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.330
play with flow in such a way

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
that is reduces drag by 32 percent.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:04.330
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
MIT just has a new radio chip

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.330
that uses far less power than our chips.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
And it's based on the cochlear of your ear,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.330
able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
and radio signals, in the same chip.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.330
Finally, on an ecosystem scale.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.330
At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
we work with HOK Architects.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.330
We're looking at building whole cities

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
in their planning department.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
And what we're saying is that,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
shouldn't our cities do at least as well,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
in terms of ecosystem services,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
as the native systems that they replace?

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.330
So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.330
that hold cities to this higher bar.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
way to innovate.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.330
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.330
Dr. Adam Neiman.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
This is a depiction of

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
all of the water on Earth

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
in relation to the volume of the Earth --

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water --

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.330
and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
And inside those balls

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.330
life, over 3.8 billion years,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.330
has made a lush, livable place for us.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And we are in a long, long line

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
of organisms

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.330
to come to this planet and ask ourselves,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.330
How can we do what life has learned to do?

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.330
Now in order to do this, the design challenge

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
of our century, I think,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:06.330
we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
and to somehow meet them again.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
I've been honored to work on

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.330
It's called AskNature.org.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
is to organize all biological information

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.330
by design and engineering function.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330
Ed Wilson's TED wish.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
And he's gathering all biological information

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
on one website.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.330
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
"What can we learn from this organism?"

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.330
And that information will go into AskNature.org.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
will be able, in the moment of creation,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.330
to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.330
and your own kidneys.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
And we'll begin to

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
be able to

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
do as Cody does,

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.330
and actually be in touch

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
with these incredible models,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
these elders that have been here

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
far, far longer than we have.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.330
And hopefully, with their help,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.330
we'll learn how to live on this Earth,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.330
and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
Thank you very much.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.330
(Applause)
