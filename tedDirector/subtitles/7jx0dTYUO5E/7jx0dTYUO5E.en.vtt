00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.652
Alright.

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.306
I'm going to show you a couple of images

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.306
from a very diverting paper
in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.006
I'm going to go way out on a limb and say
that it is the most diverting paper

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.706
ever published in
The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.306
The title is "Observations
of In-Utero Masturbation."

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.306
(Laughter)

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.606
Okay. Now on the left you can see
the hand -- that's the big arrow --

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.852
and the penis on the right.
The hand hovering.

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:56.836
And over here we have,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.306
in the words of radiologist
Israel Meisner,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.306
"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion
resembling masturbation movements."

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.306
Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.306
so it would have been moving images.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.306
Orgasm is a reflex
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
Now, this is the part
of the nervous system

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:16.306
that deals with the things
that we don't consciously control,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.329
like digestion, heart rate
and sexual arousal.

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:26.095
And the orgasm reflex can be triggered
by a surprisingly broad range of input.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.306
Genital stimulation. Duh.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.306
But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.421
who could be brought to orgasm
by having someone stroke her eyebrow.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.306
People with spinal cord injuries,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.306
like paraplegias, quadriplegias,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.306
will often develop a very,
very sensitive area

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.306
right above the level of their injury,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.306
wherever that is.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.306
There is such a thing
as a knee orgasm in the literature.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.306
I think the most curious one
that I came across

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.306
was a case report of a woman

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.306
who had an orgasm every time
she brushed her teeth.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.306
(Laughter)

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.306
Something in the complex
sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.306
was triggering orgasm.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.306
And she went to a neurologist,
who was fascinated.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.306
He checked to see
if it was something in the toothpaste,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.306
but no -- it happened with any brand.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.473
They stimulated her gums with a toothpick,
to see if that was doing it.

00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:30.306
No. It was the whole, you know, motion.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.306
And the amazing thing to me

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.306
is that you would think this woman
would have excellent oral hygiene.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.306
(Laughter)

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.045
Sadly -- this is what it said
in the journal paper --

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.306
"She believed that she was
possessed by demons

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.306
and switched to mouthwash
for her oral care."

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.306
It's so sad.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.407
(Laughter)

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.306
When I was working on the book,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.306
I interviewed a woman
who can think herself to orgasm.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.306
She was part of a study
at Rutgers University.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.306
You've got to love that. Rutgers.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.306
So I interviewed her in Oakland,
in a sushi restaurant.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.306
And I said, "So, could you
do it right here?"

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.506
And she said,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.645
"Yeah, but you know I'd rather
finish my meal if you don't mind."

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.706
(Laughter)

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.306
But afterwards, she was kind enough
to demonstrate on a bench outside.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.426
It was remarkable.
It took about one minute.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.306
And I said to her,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.306
"Are you just doing this all the time?"

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.407
(Laughter)

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.306
She said, "No. Honestly, when I get home,
I'm usually too tired."

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.306
(Laughter)

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.306
She said that the last time
she had done it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.306
was on the Disneyland tram.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.306
(Laughter)

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.306
The headquarters for orgasm,
along the spinal nerve,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.065
is something called the sacral nerve root,

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.306
which is back here.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.306
And if you trigger,
if you stimulate with an electrode,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.306
the precise spot,
you will trigger an orgasm.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.306
And it is a fact that you can trigger
spinal reflexes in dead people --

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.306
a certain kind of dead person,
a beating-heart cadaver.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.306
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.306
legally dead, definitely checked out,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.306
but is being kept alive on a respirator,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.306
so that their organs will be oxygenated
for transplantation.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.306
Now in one of these brain-dead people,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.306
if you trigger the right spot,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.306
you will see something every now and then.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.378
There is a reflex called
the Lazarus reflex.

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:36.306
And this is -- I'll demonstrate
as best I can, not being dead.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.306
It's like this. You trigger the spot.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.306
The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.306
Very unsettling for people
working in pathology labs.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.407
(Laughter)

00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:52.306
Now, if you can trigger
the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.703
why not the orgasm reflex?

00:04:55.615 --> 00:04:59.306
I asked this question
to a brain death expert,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.306
Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough
to return my emails.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.407
(Laughter)

00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:08.306
I said, "So, could you conceivably
trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.997
She said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve
is being oxygenated,

00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:14.306
you conceivably could."

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.306
Obviously it wouldn't be
as much fun for the person.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.306
But it would be an orgasm --

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.407
(Laughter)

00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:22.752
nonetheless.

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:26.997
There is a researcher
at the University of Alabama

00:05:27.021 --> 00:05:28.306
who does orgasm research.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.426
I said to her,
"You should do an experiment.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.306
You know? You can get cadavers
if you work at a university."

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.306
I said, "You should actually do this."

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.808
She said, "You get the human subjects
review board approval for this one."

00:05:38.832 --> 00:05:40.695
(Laughter)

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.306
According to 1930s marriage manual author,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.306
Theodoor van De Velde,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.306
a slight seminal odor can be detected
on the breath of a woman

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.476
within about an hour
after sexual intercourse.

00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:57.306
Theodoor van De Velde was something
of a semen connoisseur.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.306
(Laughter)

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.997
This is a guy writing a book,
"Ideal Marriage," you know.

00:06:02.021 --> 00:06:04.306
Very heavy hetero guy.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.473
But he wrote in this book,
"Ideal Marriage" --

00:06:06.497 --> 00:06:10.306
he said that he could differentiate
between the semen of a young man,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.306
which he said had a fresh,
exhilarating smell,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.306
and the semen of mature men,
whose semen smelled, quote,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.306
"Remarkably like that of the flowers
of the Spanish chestnut.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.306
Sometimes quite freshly floral,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.378
and then again sometimes
extremely pungent."

00:06:25.402 --> 00:06:30.306
(Laughter)

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.306
Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,
a man began hiccupping.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.306
And this was one of those cases
that went on and on.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
He tried everything his friends suggested.

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:42.306
Nothing seemed to help.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.752
Days went by.

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:48.306
At a certain point, the man,
still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.306
And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.306
He told his doctor,
who published a case report

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.306
in a Canadian medical journal
under the title,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.306
"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential
Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.306
I love this article because
at a certain point they suggested

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.306
that unattached hiccuppers
could try masturbation.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.407
(Laughter)

00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:14.306
I love that because there is like a whole
demographic: unattached hiccuppers.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.306
(Laughter)

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.306
Married, single, unattached hiccupper.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.306
In the 1900s, early 1900s,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.306
a lot of gynecologists believed
that when a woman has an orgasm,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.306
the contractions serve to suck
the semen up through the cervix

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.616
and sort of deliver it
really quickly to the egg,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.306
thereby upping the odds of conception.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.306
It was called the "upsuck" theory.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.329
(Laughter)

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:49.306
If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.306
physicians believed that orgasm in women

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.306
was not just helpful
for conception, but necessary.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.306
Doctors back then
were routinely telling men

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.306
the importance of pleasuring their wives.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.306
Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer
Theodoor van De Velde --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.407
(Laughter)

00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.306
has a line in his book.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.394
I loved this guy.

00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:15.306
I got a lot of mileage
out of Theodoor van De Velde.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.306
He had this line in his book

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.306
that supposedly comes
from the Habsburg Monarchy,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.306
where there was an empress Maria Theresa,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.306
who was having trouble conceiving.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.306
And apparently the royal
court physician said to her,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.330
"I am of the opinion that the vulva
of your most sacred majesty

00:08:32.354 --> 00:08:35.306
be titillated for some time
prior to intercourse."

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.407
(Laughter)

00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:40.306
It's apparently, I don't know,
on the record somewhere.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.168
Masters and Johnson:

00:08:42.192 --> 00:08:44.306
now we're moving forward to the 1950s.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.306
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.306
which is also really fun to say.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.306
They didn't buy it.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.406
And they decided,
being Masters and Johnson,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.406
that they would get to the bottom of it.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.406
They brought women into the lab
-- I think it was five women --

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.306
and outfitted them with cervical caps
containing artificial semen.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.306
And in the artificial semen
was a radio-opaque substance,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.329
such that it would show up on an X-ray.

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:14.306
This is the 1950s.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.306
Anyway, these women
sat in front of an X-ray device.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.306
And they masturbated.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.306
And Masters and Johnson looked to see
if the semen was being sucked up.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.306
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.306
You may be wondering,
"How do you make artificial semen?"

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.306
(Laughter)

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.426
I have an answer for you.
I have two answers.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.306
You can use flour and water,
or cornstarch and water.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.306
I actually found three
separate recipes in the literature.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.407
(Laughter)

00:09:45.431 --> 00:09:47.306
My favorite being the one that says --

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.407
you know, they have
the ingredients listed,

00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:51.622
and then in a recipe
it will say, for example,

00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:53.306
"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.306
This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.306
(Laughter)

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.854
There's another way that orgasm
might boost fertility.

00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:03.306
This one involves men.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.759
Sperm that sit around in the body
for a week or more

00:10:05.783 --> 00:10:08.306
start to develop abnormalities

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.306
that make them less effective
at head-banging their way into the egg.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.770
British sexologist Roy Levin
has speculated

00:10:15.794 --> 00:10:17.329
that this is perhaps why men

00:10:17.353 --> 00:10:20.306
evolved to be such enthusiastic
and frequent masturbators.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.306
He said, "If I keep tossing myself off
I get fresh sperm being made."

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.306
Which I thought
was an interesting idea, theory.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.306
So now you have an evolutionary excuse.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.306
(Laughter)

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.306
Okay.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.306
(Laughter)

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.306
All righty. There is considerable evidence
for upsuck in the animal kingdom --

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.306
pigs, for instance.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.306
In Denmark, the Danish National Committee
for Pig Production

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.283
found out that if you
sexually stimulate a sow

00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:57.161
while you artificially inseminate her,

00:10:57.185 --> 00:11:00.006
you will see a six-percent increase
in the farrowing rate,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.306
which is the number of piglets produced.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.306
So they came up with this five-point
stimulation plan for the sows.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.306
There is posters they put in the barn,
and they have a DVD.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.306
And I got a copy of this DVD.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.407
(Laughter)

00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:19.306
This is my unveiling,
because I am going to show you a clip.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.306
(Laughter)

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.956
So, okay.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.306
Now, here we go, la la la, off to work.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.306
It all looks very innocent.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.426
He's going to be doing things
with his hands

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.306
that the boar would use
his snout, lacking hands. Okay.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.306
(Laughter)

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.930
This is it.

00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:43.306
The boar has a very odd
courtship repertoire.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.306
(Laughter)

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.306
This is to mimic the weight of the boar.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.306
(Laughter)

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.306
You should know, the clitoris
of the pig is inside the vagina.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.605
So this may be
sort of titillating for her.

00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:58.668
Here we go.

00:11:58.692 --> 00:12:20.306
(Laughter)

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.306
And the happy result.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.306
(Applause)

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.306
I love this video.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.930
There is a point in this video,
towards the beginning,

00:12:28.954 --> 00:12:32.192
where they zoom in for a close up
of his hand with his wedding ring,

00:12:32.216 --> 00:12:34.313
as if to say,
"It's okay, it's just his job.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.706
He really does like women."

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.306
(Laughter)

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.786
Okay. When I was in Denmark,
my host was named Anne Marie.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.306
And I said, "So why don't you just
stimulate the clitoris of the pig?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.306
Why don't you have the farmers do that?

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.306
That's not one of your five steps."

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.353
I have to read you
what she said, because I love it.

00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:56.806
She said, "It was a big hurdle

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.306
just to get farmers to touch
underneath the vulva.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.306
So we thought, let's not mention
the clitoris right now."

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.306
(Laughter)

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.759
Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,
can purchase a -- this is true --

00:13:10.783 --> 00:13:12.306
a sow vibrator,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.669
that hangs on the sperm
feeder tube to vibrate.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:19.306
Because, as I mentioned,
the clitoris is inside the vagina.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.306
So possibly, you know,
a little more arousing than it looks.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.306
And I also said to her,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.807
"Now, these sows. I mean,
you may have noticed there.

00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:29.406
The sow doesn't look to be
in the throes of ecstasy."

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.573
And she said, you can't make
that conclusion,

00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:35.517
because animals don't register
pain or pleasure

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:37.588
on their faces in the same way that we do.

00:13:37.612 --> 00:13:40.306
Pigs, for example, are more like dogs.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.426
They use the upper half of the face;
the ears are very expressive.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.306
So you're not really sure
what's going on with the pig.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.862
Primates, on the other hand,
we use our mouths more.

00:13:50.818 --> 00:13:54.306
This is the ejaculation face
of the stump-tailed macaque.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.306
(Laughter)

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.306
And, interestingly, this has been
observed in female macaques,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.306
but only when mounting another female.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.306
(Laughter)

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.593
Masters and Johnson.

00:14:08.617 --> 00:14:11.804
In the 1950s, they decided,
okay, we're going to figure out

00:14:11.828 --> 00:14:14.306
the entire human sexual response cycle,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.306
from arousal, all the way through orgasm,
in men and women --

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
everything that happens in the human body.

00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:22.306
Okay, with women,
a lot of this is happening inside.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.306
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.306
They developed an artificial
coition machine.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.306
This is basically
a penis camera on a motor.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.306
There is a phallus,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.306
clear acrylic phallus,
with a camera and a light source,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.306
attached to a motor
that is kind of going like this.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.306
And the woman would have sex with it.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
That is what they would do.
Pretty amazing.

00:14:45.354 --> 00:14:47.306
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.854
This just kills me,
not because I wanted to use it --

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:52.306
I wanted to see it.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.306
(Laughter)

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.306
One fine day,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.212
Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:05.362
the average distance
traveled by ejaculated semen.

00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:08.306
This was not idle curiosity.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.306
Doctor Kinsey had heard --

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.806
and there was a theory going around
at the time, this being the 1940s --

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.306
that the force with which
semen is thrown against the cervix

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.306
was a factor in fertility.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.306
Kinsey thought it was bunk,
so he got to work.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.306
He got together in his lab

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.306
300 men, a measuring tape,
and a movie camera.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.306
(Laughter)

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.306
And in fact, he found
that in three quarters of the men

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.306
the stuff just kind of slopped out.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.306
It wasn't spurted or thrown
or ejected under great force.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.306
However, the record holder

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.188
landed just shy of the eight-foot mark,
which is impressive.

00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:54.306
(Laughter)

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.407
(Applause)

00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.306
Yes. Exactly.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.407
(Laughter)

00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.306
Sadly, he's anonymous.
His name is not mentioned.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.274
(Laughter)

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:07.569
In his write-up
of this experiment in his book,

00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:10.306
Kinsey wrote,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.306
"Two sheets were laid down to protect
the oriental carpets."

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.306
(Laughter)

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.306
Which is my second favorite line
in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.306
My favorite being, "Cheese crumbs
spread before a pair of copulating rats

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.671
will distract the female,
but not the male."

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.306
(Laughter)

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.306
Thank you very much.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.306
(Applause)

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
Thanks!
