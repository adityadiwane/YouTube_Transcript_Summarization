00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Good morning.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Happy to see so many fine folks out here

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and so many smiling faces.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I have a very peculiar

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
background, attitude and approach

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
to the real world

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
because I am a conjurer.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Now, I prefer that term over magician,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
because if I were a magician, that would mean

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
that I use spells and incantations

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and weird gestures

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in order to accomplish real magic.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
who is someone who pretends to be

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
a real magician. (Laughter)

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
We depend on the fact

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that audiences, such as yourselves,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
will make assumptions.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
For example, when I walked up here

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and I took the microphone from the stand

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
and switched it on,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
(Laughter)

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
As a matter of fact, this is something

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
It's a beard trimmer, you see?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And it makes a very bad microphone;

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I've tried it many times. (Laughter)

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
The other assumption that you made --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and this little lesson is to show you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that you will make assumptions.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Not only that you can, but that you will

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
when they are properly suggested to you.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
You believe I'm looking at you.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I know you're there because I can hear you,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Quite empty frames.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Now why would a grown man appear before you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
wearing empty frames on his face?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to deceive you, to show that you, too,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
can make assumptions.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Don't you ever forget that.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
so I can actually see you,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
(Laughter)

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I have to do something now, which seems

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
a little bit strange for a magician.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
But I'm going to take some medication.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This is a full bottle of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Calms Forte.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I'll explain that in just a moment.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Ignore the instructions,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that's what the government has to put in there

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
to confuse you, I'm sure.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I will take enough of these. Mm.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Indeed, the whole container.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I must tell you that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I am an actor.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I play the part of a magician,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and actually claim to be

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
you would be insulted

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and rightly so.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Why would a man assume that you would believe

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
something bizarre like this?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
But there exists out there

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
a very large population

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
of people who will tell you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that they have psychic, magical powers

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that they can predict the future,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that they can make contact with the deceased.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Oh, they also say

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
they will sell you astrology

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
or other fortunetelling methods.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And they also say

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that they can give you perpetual motion machines

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and free energy systems.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
They claim to be psychics,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
or sensitives, whatever they can.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But the one thing that has made a big comeback

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
just recently

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
is this business of

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
speaking with the dead.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Now, to my innocent mind,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
dead implies

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
incapable of communicating. (Laughter)

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
You might agree with me on that.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
But these people, they tend to tell you that

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
not only can they communicate with the dead --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
"Hi, there" --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
but they can hear the dead as well,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and they can relay this information back to the living.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
I wonder if that's true.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I don't think so, because

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
this subculture of people

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
exactly the same --

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and they effectively and profoundly

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
deceive millions of people around the earth,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
to their detriment.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
They deceive these people,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
costs them a lot of money,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
cost them a lot of emotional anguish.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Billions of dollars are spent

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
every year, all over the globe,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
on these charlatans.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now, I have two questions

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
I would like to ask these people

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
if I had the opportunity to do so.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
First question: If I want to ask them to call up --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
because they do hear them through the ear.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
They listen to the spirits like this --

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
because, when she died, she had the family will,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and my family

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Good bye."

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And she didn't answer the damn question!

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Where is the will?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Now, she could easily have said,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
We paid a lot of money for that information,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
be we didn't get it.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Suppose I ask them to contact

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Why do they insist on saying --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
remember, they speak into this ear --

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Is this a hunting game?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Hunting and fishing? What is it?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
But it is a cruel, vicious,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
absolutely conscienceless --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
game that these people play.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
the grieving, the needy people out there.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Now, this is a process

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
that is called cold reading.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
There's one fellow out there,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
John Edward, Sylvia Browne

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
James Van Praagh is very big.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And what does he do? He likes to tell you

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
how the deceased got deceased,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that he had trouble breathing."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Folks, that's what dying is all about!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
(Laughter)

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It's that simple.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I don't think so.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
"Why am I getting electricity?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Was he an electrician?" "No."

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
It was a game of hunting questions like this.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
This is what they go through.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Now, folks often ask us

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
at the James Randi Educational Foundation,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
but that comfort lasts

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
only about 20 minutes or so.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
I just paid a lot of money for that reading.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
They always say that.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
They don't get any information,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
they don't get any value for what they spend.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
We call her "The Talons."

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Sylvia Browne -- thank you --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Sylvia Browne is the big operator

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
in this field at this very moment.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
she actually gets 700 dollars

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
she doesn't even go there in person,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and you have to wait up to two years because

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
she's booked ahead that amount of time.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
You pay by credit card or whatever,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and then she will call you

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
sometime in the next two years.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
That's her, you can tell right away.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
We all know who he is on television.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
He's well educated, he's smart,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
but he doesn't give a damn.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
He just doesn't care.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and he will expose her

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
to television publicity all the time.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
She gives you the names of previous lives,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
who you were in previous lives.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
Duh.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
It turns out that the women

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
that she gives readings for

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And the men were all Grecian warriors

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
fighting with Agamemnon.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Nothing is ever said about

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
who died of consumption.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
You see these folks on television --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
If they call back any of my friends,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
they're not going to... Well, you see the story.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
(Laughter)

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
an exception in one way,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Very simply won.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
or supernatural event or power of any kind

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
under proper observing conditions.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
It's very easy, win the million dollars.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
she's the only professional psychic

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
in the whole world

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
that has accepted our challenge.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
six and a half years ago.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Duh.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
she can't reach me?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
(Laughter)

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
I'm alive, you may have noticed.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Well, pretty well anyway.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
because I'm a godless person.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
All the more reason to take the million dollars,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
wouldn't you think, Sylvia?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
They're ruined financially and emotionally

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
because they've given their money and their faith

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
to these people.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Now, I popped some pills earlier.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
I have to explain that to you.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Hmm. You've heard of it.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
It's an alternative form of healing, right?

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
This is Calms Forte,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
I just ingested

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
(Laughter)

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
It says right on the back here,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
"In case of overdose,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
contact your poison control center immediately,"

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and it gives an 800 number.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I don't really need it

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
because I've been doing this stunt

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
for audiences all over the world

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
for the last eight or 10 years,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Why don't they affect me?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
(Laughter)

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Applause)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
The answer may surprise you.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
What is homeopathy?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
It's taking a medicine that really works

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and diluting it down

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
well beyond Avogadro's limit.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Diluting it down to the point

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
where there's none of it left. (Laughter)

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Now folks, this is not

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
It's exactly equivalent to taking

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.260
one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and waiting two years or so

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
until the solution is homogeneous.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Then, when you get a headache,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
(Laughter)

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one --

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
the more dilute the medicine is, they say,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
the more powerful it is.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
He died of an overdose.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
He forgot to take his pill.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
(Laughter)

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Work on it. Work on it.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
I don't know what we're doing,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
believing in all this nonsense over all these years.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Now, let me tell you,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
The James Randi Educational Foundation

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
is waving this very big carrot,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
but I must say, the fact that nobody

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
has taken us up on this offer

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
They might, some place out there.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
over the telephone --

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
that's more than lawyers make!

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
just to make me look silly?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
Just to get rid of this godless person out there

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
I think that something needs to be done about this.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
on how to contact federal, state

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and local authorities

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
to get them to do something.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
If you find out -- now I understand.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
about AIDS epidemics

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and starving kids around the world

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Those are very important,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
critically important to us.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
And we must do something about those problems.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
But at the same time,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
as Arthur C. Clarke said,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
The rotting of the human mind,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and the supernatural --

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
all of this total nonsense,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
this medieval thinking --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
I think something should be done about that,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and it all lies in education.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Largely, it's the media

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
who are to blame for this sort of thing.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
They shamelessly promote

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
all kinds of nonsense of this sort

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
because it pleases the sponsors.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
That's what they're looking at.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
We really must do something about this.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
I'm willing to take your suggestions,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and I'm willing to have you

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
tune in to our webpage.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
It's www.randi.org.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Go in there and look at the archives,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and you will begin to understand much more

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
of what I've been talking about today.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
You will see the records that we have.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
There's nothing like sitting in that library

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and having a family appear there

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
She cashed in the CDs,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
she gave away the stocks and the certificates.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
That's really sad to hear,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
and it hasn't helped them one bit,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
hasn't solved any of their problems.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and of the minds all the way around the earth,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Now, we've offered this carrot,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
as I say, we've dangled the carrot.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Oh, we get lots of them,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
hundreds of them every year come by.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
These are dowsers and people

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
who think that they can talk to the dead as well,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
their own so-called powers.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
The professionals never come near us,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
except in that case of Sylvia Browne

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
that I told you about a moment ago.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
She did accept and then backed away.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
I'm James Randi,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
and I'm waiting.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Thank you.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
(Applause)
