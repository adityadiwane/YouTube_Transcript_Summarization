00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:16.975
What has the War on Drugs 
done to the world?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.152
Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.999
Central America, so many 
other parts of the planet,

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.799
the global black market estimated

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.375
at 300 billion dollars a year,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.817
prisons packed in the 
United States and elsewhere,

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:33.495
police and military drawn 
into an unwinnable war

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.757
that violates basic rights, 
and ordinary citizens

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:39.738
just hope they don't get 
caught in the crossfire,

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:42.100
and meanwhile, more people using

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.361
more drugs than ever.

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:46.656
It's my country's history 
with alcohol prohibition

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:49.783
and Al Capone, times 50.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.336
Which is why it's 
particularly galling to me

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:56.465
as an American that we've 
been the driving force

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.501
behind this global drug war.

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.503
Ask why so many countries criminalize

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:02.292
drugs they'd never heard of,

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.318
why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:07.540
criminalization over health,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.884
even why most of the money worldwide

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:11.549
for dealing with drug abuse goes not

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.320
to helping agencies but those that punish,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.639
and you'll find the good old U.S. of A.

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.817
Why did we do this?

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:23.113
Some people, especially in Latin America,

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.846
think it's not really about drugs.

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:27.009
It's just a subterfuge for advancing

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.167
the realpolitik interests of the U.S.

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:33.530
But by and large, that's not it.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.443
We don't want gangsters and guerrillas

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:38.513
funded with illegal drug money

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:41.629
terrorizing and taking over other nations.

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:46.200
No, the fact is, America really is crazy

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.040
when it comes to drugs.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.200
I mean, don't forget, we're 
the ones who thought

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.866
that we could prohibit alcohol.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.149
So think about our global drug war

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.885
not as any sort of rational policy,

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.627
but as the international projection

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:03.114
of a domestic psychosis.

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:06.160
(Applause)

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.827
But here's the good news.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.120
Now it's the Russians leading
the Drug War and not us.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.700
Most politicians in my country

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.021
want to roll back the Drug War now,

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.833
put fewer people behind bars, not more,

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.342
and I'm proud to say as an American

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:20.926
that we now lead the world

00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:23.166
in reforming marijuana policies.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.112
It's now legal for medical purposes

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.912
in almost half our 50 states,

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:29.274
millions of people can 
purchase their marijuana,

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.190
their medicine, in government-
licensed dispensaries,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.270
and over half my fellow 
citizens now say it's time

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.643
to legally regulate and tax marijuana

00:02:37.643 --> 00:02:39.320
more or less like alcohol.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.287
That's what Colorado and 
Washington are doing,

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:45.673
and Uruguay, and others 
are sure to follow.

00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:48.161
So that's what I do:

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:51.967
work to end the Drug War.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:54.626
I think it all started growing up

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:57.205
in a fairly religious, moral family,

00:02:57.205 --> 00:02:59.241
eldest son of a rabbi,

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:01.412
going off to university where I

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:04.762
smoked some marijuana

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.980
and I liked it. (Laughter)

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.455
And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.930
that alcohol was really the
more dangerous of the two,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.617
but my friends and I could get busted

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:15.190
for smoking a joint.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.749
Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.690
so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation
on international drug control.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.180
I talked my way into the State Department.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.409
I got a security clearance.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.373
I interviewed hundreds of DEA
and other law enforcement agents

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.530
all around Europe and the Americas,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.761
and I'd ask them,

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.385
"What do you think the answer is?"

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:36.165
Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.980
"You can't really cut off the supply.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.534
The answer lies back in the U.S.,

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:42.337
in cutting off the demand."

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:44.853
So then I go back home and I talk to people

00:03:44.853 --> 00:03:47.453
involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,

00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:50.681
"You know, Ethan, you can't 
really cut off the demand.

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.628
The answer lies over there.
You've got to cut off the supply."

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:56.238
Then I'd go and talk 
to the guys in customs

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:58.600
trying to stop drugs at the borders,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.817
and they'd say, "You're 
not going to stop it here.

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:03.786
The answer lies over there,

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.778
in cutting off supply and demand."

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:08.408
And it hit me:

00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:10.693
Everybody involved in this

00:04:10.693 --> 00:04:13.133
thought the answer lay in that area

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:16.141
about which they knew the least.

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:18.645
So that's when I started 
reading everything I could

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.525
about psychoactive drugs: 
the history, the science,

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:23.630
the politics, all of it,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.946
and the more one read,

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:28.488
the more it hit you how a thoughtful,

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:31.852
enlightened, intelligent 
approach took you over here,

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:34.360
whereas the politics and laws of my country

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.396
were taking you over here.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:40.187
And that disparity struck me as this incredible

00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:44.354
intellectual and moral puzzle.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.411
There's probably never been

00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:51.020
a drug-free society.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.770
Virtually every society

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.171
has ingested psychoactive substances

00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:58.786
to deal with pain, increase 
our energy, socialize,

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:00.819
even commune with God.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.507
Our desire to alter our consciousness

00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:05.937
may be as fundamental as our desires

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:09.854
for food, companionship and sex.

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:11.991
So our true challenge

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.871
is to learn how to live with drugs

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.627
so they cause the least possible harm

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:21.840
and in some cases the 
greatest possible benefit.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.910
I'll tell you something else I learned,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.998
that the reason some drugs 
are legal and others not

00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:29.956
has almost nothing to do 
with science or health

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:31.789
or the relative risk of drugs,

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.185
and almost everything to do with who uses

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:37.313
and who is perceived 
to use particular drugs.

00:05:37.313 --> 00:05:39.383
In the late 19th century,

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:42.723
when most of the drugs that
are now illegal were legal,

00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:45.435
the principal consumers 
of opiates in my country

00:05:45.435 --> 00:05:49.239
and others were middle-aged white women,

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:51.598
using them to alleviate aches and pains

00:05:51.598 --> 00:05:54.320
when few other analgesics were available.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.481
And nobody thought about 
criminalizing it back then

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.478
because nobody wanted to 
put Grandma behind bars.

00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:01.936
But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese

00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:03.725
started showing up in my country,

00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:06.323
working hard on the railroads and the mines

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:07.802
and then kicking back in the evening

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.506
just like they had in the old country

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:12.163
with a few puffs on that opium pipe,

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.480
that's when you saw the 
first drug prohibition laws

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.280
in California and Nevada,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.158
driven by racist fears of Chinese

00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:19.994
transforming white women

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:23.378
into opium-addicted sex slaves.

00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:26.213
The first cocaine prohibition 
laws, similarly prompted

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:29.980
by racist fears of black men 
sniffing that white powder

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.859
and forgetting their proper place

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.813
in Southern society.

00:06:33.813 --> 00:06:35.796
And the first marijuana prohibition laws,

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.869
all about fears of Mexican migrants

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:41.645
in the West and the Southwest.

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:44.379
And what was true in my country,

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.876
is true in so many others as well,

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.120
with both the origins of these laws

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.543
and their implementation.

00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:54.160
Put it this way,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.841
and I exaggerate only slightly:

00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.923
If the principal smokers of cocaine

00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:01.917
were affluent older white men

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:04.906
and the principal consumers of Viagra

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:06.800
were poor young black men,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.912
then smokable cocaine would be easy to
get with a prescription from your doctor

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:13.197
and selling Viagra would get you 
five to 10 years behind bars.

00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:16.981
(Applause)

00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:20.835
I used to be a professor teaching about this.

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:24.490
Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist,

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.251
and what drives me is my shame

00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.429
at living in an otherwise great nation

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:32.212
that has less than five percent
of the world's population

00:07:32.212 --> 00:07:35.840
but almost 25 percent of the
world's incarcerated population.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.241
It's the people I meet 
who have lost someone

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.795
they love to drug-related 
violence or prison

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:42.257
or overdose or AIDS

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.237
because our drug policies emphasize

00:07:44.237 --> 00:07:46.261
criminalization over health.

00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:49.490
It's good people who have lost their jobs,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.120
their homes, their freedom, 
even their children

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.588
to the state, not because they hurt anyone

00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:59.813
but solely because they chose to use one drug

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.827
instead of another.

00:08:02.827 --> 00:08:07.176
So is legalization the answer?

00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:09.213
On that, I'm torn:

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:12.396
three days a week I think yes,
three days a week I think no,

00:08:12.396 --> 00:08:14.616
and on Sundays I'm agnostic.

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:17.142
But since today is Tuesday,

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:21.844
let me just say that legally 
regulating and taxing

00:08:21.844 --> 00:08:24.262
most of the drugs that 
are now criminalized

00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:26.636
would radically reduce 
the crime, violence,

00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:28.368
corruption and black markets,

00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:31.405
and the problems of adulterated
and unregulated drugs,

00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:33.352
and improve public safety,

00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:35.556
and allow taxpayer resources to be developed

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.772
to more useful purposes.

00:08:37.772 --> 00:08:41.552
I mean, look, the markets 
in marijuana, cocaine,

00:08:41.552 --> 00:08:43.565
heroin and methamphetamine

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.130
are global commodities markets

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.325
just like the global markets 
in alcohol, tobacco,

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:52.205
coffee, sugar, and so many other things.

00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:54.601
Where there is a demand,

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.124
there will be a supply.

00:08:57.124 --> 00:08:59.280
Knock out one source and another

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.990
inevitably emerges.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.370
People tend to think of prohibition

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.868
as the ultimate form of regulation

00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:09.887
when in fact it represents 
the abdication of regulation

00:09:09.887 --> 00:09:13.904
with criminals filling the void.

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.164
Which is why putting criminal laws and police

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:19.382
front and center in trying to control

00:09:19.382 --> 00:09:22.486
a dynamic global commodities market

00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:25.355
is a recipe for disaster.

00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:27.526
And what we really need to do

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:29.900
is to bring the underground drug markets

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.813
as much as possible aboveground

00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:36.885
and regulate them as 
intelligently as we can

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:39.674
to minimize both the harms of drugs

00:09:39.674 --> 00:09:43.162
and the harms of prohibitionist policies.

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:46.727
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means

00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:49.393
legally regulating and 
taxing it like alcohol.

00:09:49.393 --> 00:09:52.723
The benefits of doing so are
enormous, the risks minimal.

00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:55.434
Will more people use marijuana?

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:59.405
Maybe, but it's not 
going to be young people,

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:01.407
because it's not going to 
be legalized for them,

00:10:01.407 --> 00:10:03.218
and quite frankly, they already have

00:10:03.218 --> 00:10:05.254
the best access to marijuana.

00:10:05.254 --> 00:10:07.403
I think it's going to be older people.

00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:09.562
It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s

00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:13.208
and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana

00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:16.498
to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill

00:10:16.498 --> 00:10:20.138
or that it helps with 
their arthritis or diabetes

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:25.330
or maybe helps spice up a 
long-term marriage. (Laughter)

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.484
And that just might be a 
net public health benefit.

00:10:28.484 --> 00:10:30.846
As for the other drugs,

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:33.467
look at Portugal, where 
nobody goes to jail

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.230
for possessing drugs,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.600
and the government's made 
a serious commitment

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.810
to treating addiction as a health issue.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.711
Look at Switzerland, 
Germany, the Netherlands,

00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:42.657
Denmark, England, where people who have

00:10:42.657 --> 00:10:44.558
been addicted to heroin for many years

00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:46.864
and repeatedly tried to quit and failed

00:10:46.864 --> 00:10:49.722
can get pharmaceutical 
heroin and helping services

00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:53.163
in medical clinics, and 
the results are in:

00:10:53.163 --> 00:10:56.227
Illegal drug abuse and disease

00:10:56.227 --> 00:11:00.374
and overdoses and crime 
and arrests all go down,

00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:02.523
health and well-being improve,

00:11:02.523 --> 00:11:04.255
taxpayers benefit,

00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:08.405
and many drug users even
put their addictions behind them.

00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:11.207
Look at New Zealand, which 
recently enacted a law

00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:14.142
allowing certain recreational 
drugs to be sold legally

00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:16.843
provided their safety had been established.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.542
Look here in Brazil, and some other countries,

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:22.605
where a remarkable psychoactive substance,

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:25.830
ayahuasca, can be legally 
bought and consumed

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.958
provided it's done so 
within a religious context.

00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.960
Look in Bolivia and Peru,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.749
where all sorts of products 
made from the coca leaf,

00:11:33.749 --> 00:11:35.650
the source of cocaine,

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.270
are sold legally over the counter

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.403
with no apparent harm to people's public health.

00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:44.439
I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola
had cocaine in it until 1900,

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:46.407
and so far as we know was no more addictive

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:50.460
than Coca-Cola is today.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.537
Conversely, think about cigarettes:

00:11:53.537 --> 00:11:58.523
Nothing can both hook you 
and kill you like cigarettes.

00:11:58.523 --> 00:12:01.587
When researchers ask heroin addicts

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.793
what's the toughest drug to 
quit, most say cigarettes.

00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:07.167
Yet in my country and many others,

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:09.709
half of all the people who 
were ever addicted

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:11.644
to cigarettes have quit

00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:14.652
without anyone being 
arrested or put in jail

00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:16.908
or sent to a "treatment program"

00:12:16.908 --> 00:12:18.641
by a prosecutor or a judge.

00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:21.937
What did it were higher taxes

00:12:21.937 --> 00:12:25.480
and time and place 
restrictions on sale and use

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.552
and effective anti-smoking campaigns.

00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:32.492
Now, could we reduce smoking even more

00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:36.831
by making it totally illegal? Probably.

00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:40.442
But just imagine the drug war nightmare

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:43.480
that would result.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.763
So the challenges we face today

00:12:45.763 --> 00:12:47.630
are twofold.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.645
The first is the policy challenge

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:54.323
of designing and implementing alternatives

00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:56.741
to ineffective prohibitionist policies,

00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:00.161
even as we need to get 
better at regulating

00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:03.830
and living with the drugs 
that are now legal.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.191
But the second challenge is tougher,

00:13:07.191 --> 00:13:10.802
because it's about us.

00:13:10.802 --> 00:13:14.290
The obstacles to reform 
lie not just out there

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.450
in the power of the 
prison industrial complex

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.654
or other vested interests 
that want to keep things

00:13:18.654 --> 00:13:20.080
the way they are,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920
but within each and every one of us.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.970
It's our fears and our lack of knowledge

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:34.670
and imagination that stands 
in the way of real reform.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.240
And ultimately, I think that 
boils down to the kids,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.985
and to every parent's desire
to put our baby in a bubble,

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:46.315
and the fear that somehow
drugs will pierce that bubble

00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:48.244
and put our young ones at risk.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.314
In fact, sometimes it 
seems like the entire

00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:52.290
War on Drugs gets justified

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.216
as one great big child protection act,

00:13:56.216 --> 00:13:59.823
which any young person 
can tell you it's not.

00:13:59.823 --> 00:14:03.929
So here's what I say to teenagers.

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:07.615
First, don't do drugs.

00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:11.405
Second, don't do drugs.

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:14.825
Third, if you do do drugs,

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:17.367
there's some things I want you to know,

00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:21.410
because my bottom line as your parent is,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.391
come home safely at the end of the night

00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.924
and grow up and lead a 
healthy and good adulthood.

00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:33.537
That's my drug education 
mantra: Safety first.

00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:37.193
So this is what I've dedicated my life to,

00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:39.701
to building an organization and a movement

00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:42.561
of people who believe we 
need to turn our backs

00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:44.606
on the failed prohibitions of the past

00:14:44.606 --> 00:14:47.305
and embrace new drug 
policies grounded in science,

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:50.246
compassion, health and human rights,

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:52.884
where people who come from
across the political spectrum

00:14:52.884 --> 00:14:54.865
and every other spectrum as well,

00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:56.599
where people who love our drugs,

00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:57.938
people who hate drugs,

00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:00.250
and people who don't give 
a damn about drugs,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.684
but every one of us believes 
that this War on Drugs,

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:07.931
this backward, heartless, 
disastrous War on Drugs,

00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:11.030
has got to end.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.873
Thank you.

00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:17.880
(Applause)

00:15:27.042 --> 00:15:29.722
Thank you. Thank you.

00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:31.943
Chris Anderson: Ethan,

00:15:31.943 --> 00:15:35.182
congrats — quite the reaction.

00:15:35.182 --> 00:15:37.926
That was a powerful talk.

00:15:37.926 --> 00:15:41.234
Not quite a complete standing O, though,

00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:42.921
and I'm guessing that some people here

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.187
and maybe a few watching online,

00:15:45.187 --> 00:15:49.287
maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend

00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:51.504
or whatever who got sick,

00:15:51.504 --> 00:15:54.500
maybe died from some drug overdose.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.386
I'm sure you've had these
people approach you before.

00:15:56.386 --> 00:15:58.557
What do you say to them?

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:00.739
Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the most
amazing thing that's happened of late

00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:02.980
is that I've met a growing number of people

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.558
who have actually 
lost a sibling or a child

00:16:05.558 --> 00:16:07.184
to a drug overdose,

00:16:07.184 --> 00:16:09.160
and 10 years ago, those 
people just wanted to say,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.140
let's line up all the drug 
dealers and shoot them

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.481
and that will solve it.

00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:13.776
And what they've come to understand

00:16:13.776 --> 00:16:16.659
is that the Drug War did 
nothing to protect their kids.

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:18.108
If anything, it made it more likely

00:16:18.108 --> 00:16:20.210
that those kids were put at risk.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.820
And so they're now becoming part of this

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.695
drug policy reform movement.

00:16:23.695 --> 00:16:25.385
There's other people who have kids,

00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:28.850
one's addicted to alcohol, the other
one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.278
and they ask themselves the question:

00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:32.595
Why does this kid get to 
take one step at a time

00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:33.889
and try to get better

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:35.453
and that one's got to deal with jail

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.478
and police and criminals all the time?

00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:38.948
So everybody's understanding,

00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:41.673
the Drug War's not protecting anybody.

00:16:41.673 --> 00:16:43.754
CA: Certainly in the U.S., 
you've got political gridlock

00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.149
on most issues.

00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:46.881
Is there any realistic chance of anything

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.227
actually shifting on this 
issue in the next five years?

00:16:50.227 --> 00:16:52.245
EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable. 
I'm getting all these calls

00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:54.126
from journalists now who are saying to me,

00:16:54.126 --> 00:16:56.130
"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.423
advancing politically in America right now

00:16:58.423 --> 00:17:01.314
are marijuana law reform and gay marriage.

00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:02.891
What are you doing right?"

00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:05.479
And then you're looking at 
bipartisanship breaking out

00:17:05.479 --> 00:17:07.771
with, actually, Republicans in the Congress

00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:10.840
and state legislatures 
allowing bills to be enacted

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.804
with majority Democratic support,

00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:15.320
so we've gone from being sort of the third rail,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.411
the most fearful issue of American politics,

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:20.161
to becoming one of the most successful.

00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:22.344
CA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal.
EN: Chris, thanks so much.

00:17:22.344 --> 00:17:25.264
CA: Thank you.
EN: Thank you. (Applause)
