00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
We do not invest in victims,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
we invest in survivors.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And in ways both big and small,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
the narrative of the victim

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
shapes the way we see women.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
You can't count what you don't see.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But this is the face

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
of resilience.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Six years ago,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I started writing about women entrepreneurs

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
during and after conflict.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I set out to write a compelling economic story,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
one that had great characters, that no one else was telling,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and one that I thought mattered.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And that turned out to be women.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
for business school,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
a path I knew almost nothing about.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
had graduated from college,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
let alone considered business school.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
But they had hustled to feed their kids

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and pay their rent.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And I saw from a young age

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that having a decent job and earning a good living

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
made the biggest difference

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
for families who were struggling.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So if you're going to talk about jobs,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And if you're talking about entrepreneurs

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
in conflict and post-conflict settings,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
then you must talk about women,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
because they are the population you have left.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
was 77 percent female.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I want to introduce you

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
to some of those entrepreneurs I've met

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I went to Afghanistan in 2005

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to work on a Financial Times piece,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and there I met Kamila,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
a young women who told me she had just turned down

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
a job with the international community

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
an astronomical sum in that context.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And she had turned it down, she said,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
because she was going to start her next business,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
an entrepreneurship consultancy

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that would teach business skills

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
to men and women all around Afghanistan.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Business, she said,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
was critical to her country's future.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Because long after this round of internationals left,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
business would help keep her country

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
peaceful and secure.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And she said business was even more important for women

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
because earning an income earned respect

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and money was power for women.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So I was amazed.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
(Laughter)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Why are you so passionate?"

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
She said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
My first business was a dressmaking business

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I started under the Taliban.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And that was actually an excellent business,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Think about this:

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Here were girls who braved danger

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
to become breadwinners

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And at a time of economic collapse

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and windows and doors

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
just to survive,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
these girls made the difference

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
between survival and starvation

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
for so many.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
because everywhere I went I met more of these women

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
who no one seemed to know about,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
or even wish to.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
I went on to Bosnia,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
who said, "You know, Gayle,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
but there is a lady selling cheese nearby

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
on the side of the road.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
So maybe you could interview her."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So I went out reporting

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
who at that point was opening a new factory

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
She had started her business

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
squatting in an abandoned garage,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
sewing sheets and pillow cases

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
she would take to markets all around the city

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
so that she could support

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
the 12 or 13 family members

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
who were counting on her for survival.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
By the time we met, she had 20 employees,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
most of them women,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
who were sending their boys and their girls to school.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And she was just the start.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I met women running essential oils businesses,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
wineries

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
and even the country's largest advertising agency.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
So these stories together

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
became the Herald Tribune business cover.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And when this story posted,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to feature at your next investment conference,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
here are a couple of women."

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.260
(Applause)

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But think about this.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
The IMF official is hardly the only person

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
to automatically file women under micro.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
are pervasive,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and so are the misleading mental images.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
If you see the word "microfinance,"

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
what comes to mind?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Most people say women.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And if you see the word "entrepreneur,"

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
most people think men.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Why is that?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Because we aim low and we think small

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
when it comes to women.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
but we must move beyond micro-hopes

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and micro-ambitions for women,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And in many places,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
they're there.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
In the U.S., women-owned businesses

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
In South Korea and Indonesia,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
women own nearly half a million firms.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
China, women run 20 percent

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of all small businesses.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And in the developing world overall,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
That figure is 40 to 50 percent.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Nearly everywhere I go,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
who are seeking access to finance, access to markets

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and established business networks.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
They are often ignored

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
because they're harder to help.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And as the World Bank recently noted,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
women are stuck in a productivity trap.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Those in small businesses

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
can't get the capital they need to expand

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and those in microbusiness

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
can't grow out of them.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
She sells chocolates.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And she had come to Washington,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
She had come seeking serious investment dollars

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
so that she could build the factory

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and buy the equipment she needs

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to export her chocolates

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to Africa, Europe, the Middle East

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and far beyond --

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
capital that would help her to employ

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
more than the 20 people

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that she already has working for her,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and capital that would fuel her own country's

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
economic climb.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
The great news is

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
we already know what works.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Theory and empirical evidence

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
Have already taught us.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
We don't need to invent solutions because we have them --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
cash flow loans

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
based in income rather than assets,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
because women often don't own land.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And Kiva.org, the microlender,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
small and medium sized loans.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And that's just to start.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Recently it has become very much in fashion

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
I think that is terrific.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
You know why?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
500 billion dollars at least

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Because investors saw the potential for return

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
at a time of slowing economic growth,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and so they created financial products

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and financial innovation

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
tailored to the emerging markets.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
How wonderful would it be

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
with our wallets

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and invest 500 billion dollars

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
unleashing women's economic potential?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Just think of the benefits

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
when it comes to jobs, productivity,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
employment, child nutrition,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
maternal mortality, literacy

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and much, much more.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
smaller gender gaps are directly correlated

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
with increased economic competitiveness.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And not one country in all the world

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
has eliminated its economic participation gap --

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
not one.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So the great news

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
is this is an incredible opportunity.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
We have so much room to grow.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
So you see,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
this is not about doing good,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
this is about global growth

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and global employment.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
It is about how we invest

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and it's about how we see women.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And women can no longer be

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
both half the population

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and a special interest group.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:43.260
(Applause)

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
but you're really writing about the exceptions."

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
First of all, for exceptions,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
there are a lot of them

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and they're important.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
we rightly consider them

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
icons or pioneers or innovators

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
to be emulated.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
And when we talk about women,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
they are either exceptions to be dismissed

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
or aberrations to be ignored.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And finally,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
there is no society anywhere in all the world

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
that is not changed

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
except by its most exceptional.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
these change makers and job creators

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
rather than overlook them?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
This topic of resilience is very personal to me

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and in many ways has shaped my life.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
My mom was a single mom

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
who worked at the phone company during the day

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
and sold Tupperware at night

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
so that I could have every opportunity possible.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
We shopped double coupons

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and layaway and consignment stores,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and could no longer work,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
we even applied for food stamps.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And when I would feel sorry for myself

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
as nine or 10 year-old girls do,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
yours is not a three."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
(Laughter)

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And when I was applying to business school

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and felt certain I couldn't do it

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and nobody I knew had done it,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and escaped a marriage of abuse

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
with only her dignity intact.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And she told me,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
"Never import other people's limitations."

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And when I complained to my grandmother,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
a World War II veteran

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
who worked in film for 50 years

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
and who supported me from the age of 13,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that I was terrified

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
for a fellowship overseas,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
I would never ever, ever find another job,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
(Laughter)

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
"You will find a job. Take the leap."

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
The women in my family

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
are not exceptions.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
The women in this room and watching in L.A.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
and all around the world

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
are not exceptions.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
We are not a special interest group.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
We are the majority.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And for far too long,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
we have underestimated ourselves

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and been undervalued by others.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
It is time for us to aim higher

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
when it comes to women,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
to invest more and to deploy our dollars

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
to benefit women all around the world.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
We can make a difference,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and make a difference, not just for women,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
but for a global economy

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
that desperately needs their contributions.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Together we can make certain

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
that the so-called exceptions

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
begin to rule.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
When we change the way we see ourselves,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
others will follow.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And it is time for all of us

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
to think bigger.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Thank you very much.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:09.260
(Applause)
