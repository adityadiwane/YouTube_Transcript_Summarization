00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.974
To give me an idea of how many of you here

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:17.096
may find what I'm about to tell you

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:18.721
of practical value,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.410
let me ask you please to raise your hands:

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.977
Who here is either over 65 years old

00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:28.746
or hopes to live past age 65

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.691
or has parents or grandparents who did live

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.658
or have lived past 65,

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.243
raise your hands please. (Laughter)

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.397
Okay. You are the people to whom my talk

00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:40.831
will be of practical value. (Laughter)

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.488
The rest of you

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:44.276
won't find my talk personally relevant,

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.190
but I think that you will still find the subject

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.837
fascinating.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:49.469
I'm going to talk about growing older

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.888
in traditional societies.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:54.634
This subject constitutes just one chapter

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.225
of my latest book, which compares

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.442
traditional, small, tribal societies

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.992
with our large, modern societies,

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.617
with respect to many topics

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.476
such as bringing up children,

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.397
growing older, health, dealing with danger,

00:01:10.397 --> 00:01:12.742
settling disputes, religion

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:15.533
and speaking more than one language.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.090
Those tribal societies, which constituted

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.075
all human societies for most of human history,

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:24.369
are far more diverse than are our modern,

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.536
recent, big societies.

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.899
All big societies that have governments,

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.165
and where most people are strangers to each other,

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:33.513
are inevitably similar to each other

00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:36.361
and different from tribal societies.

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.672
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:42.221
in how to run a human society.

00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.028
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:47.430
may be able to learn.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.450
Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.186
as primitive and miserable,

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:53.557
but also they shouldn't be romanticized

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.774
as happy and peaceful.

00:01:55.774 --> 00:01:58.033
When we learn of tribal practices,

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.807
some of them will horrify us,

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:02.357
but there are other tribal practices which,

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:03.706
when we hear about them,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.653
we may admire and envy

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:07.877
and wonder whether we could adopt those practices

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.574
ourselves.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:13.661
Most old people in the U.S. end up living

00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:15.648
separately from their children

00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:17.154
and from most of their friends

00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:18.846
of their earlier years,

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:22.700
and often they live in separate
retirements homes for the elderly,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.908
whereas in traditional societies,

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.742
older people instead live out their lives

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:29.908
among their children, their other relatives,

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.305
and their lifelong friends.

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.474
Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:37.639
varies enormously among traditional societies,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.820
from much worse to much better

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.778
than in our modern societies.

00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:45.575
At the worst extreme, many traditional societies

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:47.388
get rid of their elderly

00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:50.919
in one of four increasingly direct ways:

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.582
by neglecting their elderly

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:56.011
and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.065
or by abandoning them when the group moves,

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:02.204
or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,

00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:05.249
or by killing older people.

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.998
In which tribal societies do children

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:10.384
abandon or kill their parents?

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:13.408
It happens mainly under two conditions.

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:16.388
One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:18.111
that often shift camp

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:20.290
and that are physically incapable

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.413
of transporting old people who can't walk

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:25.973
when the able-bodied younger people already

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:27.908
have to carry their young children

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.726
and all their physical possessions.

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:32.890
The other condition is in societies

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.200
living in marginal or fluctuating environments,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.533
such as the Arctic or deserts,

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.117
where there are periodic food shortages,

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:43.046
and occasionally there just isn't enough food

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:45.526
to keep everyone alive.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.950
Whatever food is available has to be reserved

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.275
for able-bodied adults and for children.

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.175
To us Americans, it sounds horrible

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.408
to think of abandoning or killing

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:59.589
your own sick wife or husband

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.888
or elderly mother or father,

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:05.647
but what could those traditional societies

00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:07.130
do differently?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.950
They face a cruel situation of no choice.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.945
Their old people had to do it to their own parents,

00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:15.233
and the old people know

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:18.384
what now is going to happen to them.

00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.198
At the opposite extreme

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:22.877
in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:24.864
are the New Guinea farming societies

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.861
where I've been doing my fieldwork 
for the past 50 years,

00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.108
and most other sedentary traditional societies

00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:33.194
around the world.

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:36.142
In those societies, older people are cared for.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.492
They are fed. They remain valuable.

00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:40.680
And they continue to live in the same hut

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.367
or else in a nearby hut near their children,

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:47.266
relatives and lifelong friends.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.698
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation

00:04:49.698 --> 00:04:52.053
among societies in their treatment

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:53.450
of old people.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.087
The variation depends especially

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.357
on the usefulness of old people

00:04:57.357 --> 00:05:00.070
and on the society's values.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.393
First, as regards usefulness,

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:05.848
older people continue to perform useful services.

00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:08.533
One use of older people in traditional societies

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:10.533
is that they often are still effective

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.946
at producing food.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:15.359
Another traditional usefulness of older people

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:18.638
is that they are capable of babysitting

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.332
their grandchildren,

00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:23.002
thereby freeing up their own adult children,

00:05:23.002 --> 00:05:24.873
the parents of those grandchildren,

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:28.346
to go hunting and gathering
food for the grandchildren.

00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:30.551
Still another traditional value of older people

00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.471
is in making tools, weapons, baskets,

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:35.428
pots and textiles.

00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:38.677
In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:41.445
Older people usually are the leaders

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:43.294
of traditional societies,

00:05:43.294 --> 00:05:46.553
and the people most knowledgeable about politics,

00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:50.552
medicine, religion, songs and dances.

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:53.004
Finally, older people in traditional societies

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:56.931
have a huge significance that would never occur

00:05:56.931 --> 00:06:00.607
to us in our modern, literate societies,

00:06:00.607 --> 00:06:03.022
where our sources of information are books

00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:04.706
and the Internet.

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:08.129
In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.815
older people are the repositories of information.

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:14.380
It's their knowledge that spells the difference

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.130
between survival and death for their whole society

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.388
in a time of crisis caused by rare events

00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:23.983
for which only the oldest people alive

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:26.272
have had experience.

00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:28.742
Those, then, are the ways in which older people

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:31.645
are useful in traditional societies.

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:34.207
Their usefulness varies and contributes

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:36.825
to variation in the society's treatment

00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:38.825
of the elderly.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.644
The other set of reasons for variation

00:06:40.644 --> 00:06:42.519
in the treatment of the elderly is

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.754
the society's cultural values.

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:47.780
For example, there's particular emphasis

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.989
on respect for the elderly in East Asia,

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.900
associated with Confucius' doctrine

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.450
of filial piety, which means obedience,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.544
respect and support for elderly parents.

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:05.257
Cultural values that emphasize
respect for older people

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:08.074
contrast with the low status of the elderly

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:10.236
in the U.S.

00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:12.794
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage

00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:14.907
in job applications.

00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:17.442
They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.

00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:20.065
Our hospitals have an explicit policy

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:25.032
called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.

00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:27.805
That sinister expression means that

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.011
if hospital resources are limited,

00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:32.061
for example if only one donor heart

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.359
becomes available for transplant,

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:36.461
or if a surgeon has time to operate

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.972
on only a certain number of patients,

00:07:38.972 --> 00:07:41.922
American hospitals have an explicit policy

00:07:41.922 --> 00:07:44.242
of giving preference to younger patients

00:07:44.242 --> 00:07:45.722
over older patients

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.966
on the grounds that younger patients are considered

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:50.783
more valuable to society

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:53.428
because they have more years of life ahead of them,

00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:56.088
even though the younger patients have fewer years

00:07:56.088 --> 00:08:00.070
of valuable life experience behind them.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.298
There are several reasons for this low status

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:04.640
of the elderly in the U.S.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.825
One is our Protestant work ethic

00:08:07.825 --> 00:08:10.138
which places high value on work,

00:08:10.138 --> 00:08:12.361
so older people who are no longer working

00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.344
aren't respected.

00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:17.201
Another reason is our American emphasis

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.584
on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,

00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:23.653
so we instinctively look down on older people

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:27.250
who are no longer self-reliant and independent.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.351
Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,

00:08:31.351 --> 00:08:34.159
which shows up even in our advertisements.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.423
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict

00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:38.978
smiling young people,

00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:40.948
even though old as well as young people

00:08:40.948 --> 00:08:43.270
buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.273
Just think, what's the last time you saw

00:08:45.273 --> 00:08:47.950
a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.899
85 years old? Never.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.705
Instead, the only American ads

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:54.711
featuring white-haired old people

00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:58.576
are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:00.626
Well, what has changed in the status

00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:02.609
of the elderly today

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:05.998
compared to their status in traditional societies?

00:09:05.998 --> 00:09:07.868
There have been a few changes for the better

00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:10.073
and more changes for the worse.

00:09:10.073 --> 00:09:11.674
Big changes for the better

00:09:11.674 --> 00:09:13.825
include the fact that today we enjoy

00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:15.809
much longer lives,

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:18.103
much better health in our old age,

00:09:18.103 --> 00:09:21.741
and much better recreational opportunities.

00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:24.011
Another change for the better is that we now have

00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:26.851
specialized retirement facilities

00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.202
and programs to take care of old people.

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:33.070
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.759
that we now have

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:37.333
more old people and fewer young people

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:40.017
than at any time in the past.

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:41.768
That means that all those old people

00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:44.193
are more of a burden on the few young people,

00:09:44.193 --> 00:09:48.679
and that each old person has less individual value.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.863
Another big change for the worse
in the status of the elderly

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:54.540
is the breaking of social ties with age,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.384
because older people, their children,

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:57.700
and their friends,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.550
all move and scatter independently of each other

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.804
many times during their lives.

00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.617
We Americans move on the average

00:10:04.617 --> 00:10:06.570
every five years.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.601
Hence our older people are likely

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:10.908
to end up living distant from their children

00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:13.711
and the friends of their youth.

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.873
Yet another change for the worse
in the status of the elderly

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:20.603
is formal retirement from the workforce,

00:10:20.603 --> 00:10:23.353
carrying with it a loss of work friendships

00:10:23.353 --> 00:10:27.493
and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.978
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse

00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:32.851
is that our elderly are objectively

00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.013
less useful than in traditional societies.

00:10:36.013 --> 00:10:38.976
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer

00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:41.607
useful as repositories of knowledge.

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.550
When we want some information,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.811
we look it up in a book or we Google it

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.281
instead of finding some old person to ask.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.368
The slow pace of technological change

00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:53.190
in traditional societies

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.040
means that what someone learns there as a child

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.699
is still useful when that person is old,

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:02.302
but the rapid pace of technological change today

00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:04.369
means that what we learn as children

00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:07.259
is no longer useful 60 years later.

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:09.638
And conversely, we older people are not fluent

00:11:09.638 --> 00:11:12.672
in the technologies essential for surviving

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.643
in modern society.

00:11:14.643 --> 00:11:16.816
For example, as a 15-year-old,

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:20.406
I was considered outstandingly
good at multiplying numbers

00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:23.601
because I had memorized the multiplication tables

00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:25.746
and I know how to use logarithms

00:11:25.746 --> 00:11:28.609
and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:31.695
Today, though, those skills are utterly useless

00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:34.066
because any idiot

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:36.424
can now multiply eight-digit numbers

00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:39.611
accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.

00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.781
Conversely, I at age 75

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:44.445
am incompetent at skills

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.899
essential for everyday life.

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:49.683
My family's first TV set in 1948

00:11:49.683 --> 00:11:52.736
had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:

00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:55.486
an on-off switch, a volume knob,

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:57.707
and a channel selector knob.

00:11:57.707 --> 00:11:59.795
Today, just to watch a program

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:02.251
on the TV set in my own house,

00:12:02.251 --> 00:12:05.968
I have to operate a 41-button TV remote

00:12:05.968 --> 00:12:07.950
that utterly defeats me.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.964
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.161
and ask them to talk me through it

00:12:13.161 --> 00:12:18.158
while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.

00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:20.805
What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:24.259
in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?

00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:26.033
That's a huge problem.

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:28.504
In my remaining four minutes today,

00:12:28.504 --> 00:12:31.081
I can offer just a few suggestions.

00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:33.003
One value of older people is that they are

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:36.447
increasingly useful as grandparents

00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:38.954
for offering high-quality childcare

00:12:38.954 --> 00:12:41.607
to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,

00:12:41.607 --> 00:12:44.456
as more young women enter the workforce

00:12:44.456 --> 00:12:46.790
and as fewer young parents of either gender

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.450
stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.486
Compared to the usual alternatives

00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:56.084
of paid babysitters and day care centers,

00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:59.211
grandparents offer superior, motivated,

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:01.899
experienced child care.

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:05.165
They've already gained experience
from raising their own children.

00:13:05.165 --> 00:13:07.509
They usually love their grandchildren,

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:10.174
and are eager to spend time with them.

00:13:10.174 --> 00:13:12.075
Unlike other caregivers,

00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:14.972
grandparents don't quit their job

00:13:14.972 --> 00:13:17.408
because they found another job with higher pay

00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:20.921
looking after another baby.

00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:23.325
A second value of older people is paradoxically

00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:25.986
related to their loss of value

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:30.059
as a result of changing world
conditions and technology.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.095
At the same time, older people have gained

00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:34.406
in value today precisely because

00:13:34.406 --> 00:13:37.515
of their unique experience of living conditions

00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:39.234
that have now become rare

00:13:39.234 --> 00:13:42.544
because of rapid change, but that could come back.

00:13:42.544 --> 00:13:45.498
For example, only Americans now in their 70s

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:47.758
or older today can remember

00:13:47.758 --> 00:13:51.086
the experience of living through a great depression,

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:53.724
the experience of living through a world war,

00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:56.270
and agonizing whether or not

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.307
dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible

00:13:59.307 --> 00:14:03.420
than the likely consequences
of not dropping atomic bombs.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.696
Most of our current voters and politicians

00:14:05.696 --> 00:14:08.428
have no personal experience of any of those things,

00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:11.123
but millions of older Americans do.

00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:13.774
Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations

00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:15.161
could come back.

00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.467
Even if they don't come back,

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:18.659
we have to be able to plan for them

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:21.470
on the basis of the experience of what they were like.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.304
Older people have that experience.

00:14:23.304 --> 00:14:25.357
Younger people don't.

00:14:25.357 --> 00:14:26.877
The remaining value of older people

00:14:26.877 --> 00:14:29.320
that I'll mention involves recognizing that

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.900
while there are many things that older people

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.506
can no longer do,

00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:34.995
there are other things that they can do

00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:37.090
better than younger people.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.986
A challenge for society is 
to make use of those things

00:14:39.986 --> 00:14:42.458
that older people are better at doing.

00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:45.707
Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.

00:14:45.707 --> 00:14:48.345
Those include abilities at tasks

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:51.916
requiring physical strength and stamina,

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:55.040
ambition, and the power of novel reasoning

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.465
in a circumscribed situation,

00:14:57.465 --> 00:15:00.053
such as figuring out the structure of DNA,

00:15:00.053 --> 00:15:03.954
best left to scientists under the age of 30.

00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:05.603
Conversely, valuable attributes

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:09.149
that increase with age include experience,

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:12.162
understanding of people and human relationships,

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.453
ability to help other people

00:15:14.453 --> 00:15:16.881
without your own ego getting in the way,

00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.406
and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:23.231
such as economics and comparative history,

00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:26.445
best left to scholars over the age of 60.

00:15:26.445 --> 00:15:28.917
Hence older people are
much better than younger people

00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:32.888
at supervising, administering, advising,

00:15:32.888 --> 00:15:36.370
strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.076
and devising long-term plans.

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:41.096
I've seen this value of older people

00:15:41.096 --> 00:15:43.668
with so many of my friends in their 60s,

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:45.658
70s, 80s and 90s,

00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:48.943
who are still active as investment managers,

00:15:48.943 --> 00:15:51.956
farmers, lawyers and doctors.

00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:54.086
In short, many traditional societies

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:56.199
make better use of their elderly

00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:59.309
and give their elderly more satisfying lives

00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:02.159
than we do in modern, big societies.

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:04.024
Paradoxically nowadays,

00:16:04.024 --> 00:16:06.950
when we have more elderly people than ever before,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.671
living healthier lives and with better medical care

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.157
than ever before,

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:13.864
old age is in some respects more miserable

00:16:13.864 --> 00:16:15.631
than ever before.

00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:18.053
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized

00:16:18.053 --> 00:16:20.820
as constituting a disaster area

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.353
of modern American society.

00:16:23.353 --> 00:16:25.034
We can surely do better by learning

00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:26.909
from the lives of the elderly

00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:28.921
in traditional societies.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.863
But what's true of the lives of the elderly

00:16:30.863 --> 00:16:32.327
in traditional societies

00:16:32.327 --> 00:16:34.022
is true of many other features

00:16:34.022 --> 00:16:36.616
of traditional societies as well.

00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:39.205
Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:41.320
agriculture and metal tools

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.404
and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:45.948
There are many obvious respects

00:16:45.948 --> 00:16:48.427
in which our lives today are far happier

00:16:48.427 --> 00:16:51.489
than those in small, traditional societies.

00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:53.195
To mention just a few examples,

00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:56.165
our lives are longer, materially much richer,

00:16:56.165 --> 00:16:58.448
and less plagued by violence

00:16:58.448 --> 00:17:01.676
than are the lives of people in traditional societies.

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:04.204
But there are also things to be admired

00:17:04.204 --> 00:17:06.346
about people in traditional societies,

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:08.665
and perhaps to be learned from them.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:11.256
Their lives are usually socially much richer

00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:12.848
than our lives,

00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:15.140
although materially poorer.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.092
Their children are more self-confident,

00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:20.686
more independent, and more socially skilled

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:23.022
than are our children.

00:17:23.022 --> 00:17:26.765
They think more realistically
about dangers than we do.

00:17:26.765 --> 00:17:30.294
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,

00:17:30.294 --> 00:17:33.528
stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases

00:17:33.528 --> 00:17:36.040
that will be the causes of death of almost

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.126
all of us in this room today.

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:43.136
Features of the modern lifestyle
predispose us to those diseases,

00:17:43.136 --> 00:17:45.370
and features of the traditional lifestyle

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.877
protect us against them.

00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:50.036
Those are just some examples of what we can learn

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.324
from traditional societies.

00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:54.211
I hope that you will find it as fascinating

00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:56.620
to read about traditional societies

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.323
as I found it to live in those societies.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:01.503
Thank you.

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:05.950
(Applause)
