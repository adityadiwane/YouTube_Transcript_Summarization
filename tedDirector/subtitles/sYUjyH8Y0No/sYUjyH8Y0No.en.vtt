00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:21.161
Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:24.592
It was run by the great and powerful parents,

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:26.927
and the people were helpless

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.423
and hopeless naughty children.

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:31.926
If any of the more rowdier children questioned

00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:35.503
the authority of the parents, they were scolded.

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:38.536
If they went exploring into the parents' rooms,

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:42.319
or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.072
and told that for their own good

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:48.703
they must never go in there again.

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:51.199
Then one day, a man came to town

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.997
with boxes and boxes of secret documents

00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:55.861
stolen from the parents' rooms.

00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.887
"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.

00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:02.929
The children looked and were amazed.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.773
There were maps and minutes from meetings

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:09.038
where the parents were slagging each other off.

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:11.586
They behaved just like the children.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:15.544
And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:18.255
The only difference was, their mistakes

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.080
were in the secret filing cabinets.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.885
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:26.752
they should be in the secret filing cabinets,

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.652
or if they were, there ought to be a law

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:30.769
to allow the children access.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.576
And so she set about to make it so.

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:38.422
Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:41.576
that I was interested in were located in this building,

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:45.938
the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.599
to get my hands on were the expense receipts

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.488
of members of Parliament.

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:58.727
I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.634
It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:04.487
or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:07.010
from this Freedom of Information request,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.254
you would have thought I'd asked something like this.

00:02:10.254 --> 00:02:14.479
So I fought for about five years doing this,

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.951
and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,

00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:20.904
not -- I didn't -- Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,

00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:22.553
to revolutionize the British Parliament.

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:25.984
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:29.135
as part of research for my first book.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.000
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.375
and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:39.415
in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:43.567
waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.675
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:48.400
because I'd seen the establishment. I thought,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.756
it always sticks together. I am out of luck.

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:56.342
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.765
Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:03.119
that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.279
and then they tried to retrospectively change the law

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.952
so that it would no longer apply to them.

00:03:08.952 --> 00:03:11.874
The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,

00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:14.670
they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.165
What they hadn't counted on was digitization,

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.551
because that meant that all those paper receipts

00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:23.791
had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy

00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:26.990
for somebody to just copy that entire database,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.924
put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:33.409
which they did, and then they shopped that disk

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.367
to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:39.574
and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:42.599
of revelations, everything from porn movies

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.755
and bath plugs and new kitchens

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:49.216
and mortgages that had never been paid off.

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:53.903
The end result was six ministers resigned,

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:57.954
the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:01.973
a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:05.756
120 MPs stepped down at that election,

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:10.247
and so far, four MPs and two lords

00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:13.277
have done jail time for fraud.

00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:19.655
So, thank you. (Applause)

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.930
Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.271
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.591
all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:34.695
officials who think that they can rule over us

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:36.603
without very much prying from the public,

00:04:36.603 --> 00:04:39.056
and then suddenly confronted with a public

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:42.494
who is no longer content with that arrangement,

00:04:42.494 --> 00:04:45.732
and not only not content with it, now, more often,

00:04:45.732 --> 00:04:50.106
armed with official data itself.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:55.244
So we are moving to this democratization of information,

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:57.891
and I've been in this field for quite a while.

00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:00.532
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.467
I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:05.093
see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.

00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:07.299
I think that was a pretty good indication

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:10.380
about my future career as an investigative journalist,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.900
and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.676
is that it used to be quite a niche interest,

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:20.827
and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:23.995
wants to know about what people in power are doing.

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:27.403
They want a say in decisions that are made in their name

00:05:27.403 --> 00:05:30.426
and with their money. It's this democratization of information

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:33.132
that I think is an information enlightenment,

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.595
and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:39.590
It's about searching for the truth,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.787
not because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:46.261
No, it's about trying to find the truth based on

00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:48.890
what you can see and what can be tested.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.558
That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:55.067
the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.244
or that women should be subordinate to men,

00:05:57.244 --> 00:05:59.947
or that the Church was the official word of God.

00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:02.383
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this,

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:04.484
and they tried to suppress it,

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:07.555
but what they hadn't counted on was technology,

00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:09.980
and then they had the printing press, which suddenly

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.372
enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:16.212
and people would come together in coffee houses,

00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:19.028
discuss the ideas, plot revolution.

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:23.619
In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.024
so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.

00:06:27.024 --> 00:06:31.261
Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.

00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:36.363
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:39.236
and we have global decisions to make in this system,

00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:42.922
decisions about climate, about finance systems,

00:06:42.922 --> 00:06:46.263
about resources. And think about it --

00:06:46.263 --> 00:06:48.725
if we want to make an important decision about buying a house,

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:51.239
we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.583
but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:56.938
And if we're thinking about a finance system,

00:06:56.938 --> 00:07:00.582
we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible

00:07:00.582 --> 00:07:04.543
for one person to take in the amount, the volume

00:07:04.543 --> 00:07:08.309
of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:11.335
So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:13.720
for access to information.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.029
That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:18.005
come out, so for example, on the environment,

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:19.721
there's the Aarhus Convention,

00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:21.749
which is a European directive that gives people

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:24.497
a very strong right to know, so if your water company

00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:27.867
is dumping water into your river, sewage water

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:30.915
into your river, you have a right to know about it.

00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:34.794
In the finance industry, you now have more of a right

00:07:34.794 --> 00:07:37.347
to know about what's going on, so we have

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:40.300
different anti-bribery laws, money regulations,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.373
increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.

00:07:44.373 --> 00:07:49.617
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,

00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:52.752
pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out

00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:55.471
more and more about these systems.

00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:58.263
And they're all moving to this central system,

00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:00.630
this fully connected system,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.837
all of them except one. Can you guess which one?

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:06.508
It's the system which underpins all these other systems.

00:08:06.508 --> 00:08:10.666
It's the system by which we organize and exercise power,

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:13.596
and there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,

00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:17.723
we're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.

00:08:17.723 --> 00:08:20.804
And how is it possible that the volume of information

00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.615
can be processed that needs to in this system?

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:26.231
Well, it just can't. That's it.

00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:28.938
And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis

00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:33.261
of legitimacy in our different governments right now.

00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.444
So I've told you a bit about what I did

00:08:35.444 --> 00:08:38.129
to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.644
into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you

00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:43.308
a couple of examples of what a few other people I know

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:44.528
are doing.

00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:47.747
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer

00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:51.705
programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:56.475
and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.

00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:59.450
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.553
to make a Freedom of Information request,

00:09:02.553 --> 00:09:05.522
to ask your public body a question, so

00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:08.642
it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you

00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:10.730
that there is a lot of hassle making these requests,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.274
so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:18.745
for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:22.586
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:26.074
when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all

00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:27.726
the correspondence, it posts it up there,

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:31.381
and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.

00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:34.954
So that's open-source and it can be used in any country

00:09:34.954 --> 00:09:37.865
where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.

00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:41.075
So there's a list there of the different countries that have it,

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:42.870
and then there's a few more coming on board.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.430
So if any of you out there like the sound of that

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.163
and have a law like that in your country,

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.202
I know that Seb would love to hear from you

00:09:50.202 --> 00:09:54.274
about collaborating and getting that into your country.

00:09:54.274 --> 00:09:58.569
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.

00:09:58.569 --> 00:10:02.403
And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was

00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:05.720
one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.466
when the country's economy collapsed,

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:13.360
and then she was elected on a reform mandate,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.727
and she's now spearheading this project.

00:10:15.727 --> 00:10:18.614
It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,

00:10:18.614 --> 00:10:20.879
and they've just got funding to make it an international

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:24.318
modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws

00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:27.254
around the world about freedom of expression,

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:30.049
protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,

00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:34.523
source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.

00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:36.944
It's a place where your data can be free, so when we think

00:10:36.944 --> 00:10:40.359
about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,

00:10:40.359 --> 00:10:43.131
what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven

00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:45.868
where it can happen.

00:10:45.868 --> 00:10:49.006
In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also

00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:51.836
having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:54.959
Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.942
a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,

00:10:57.942 --> 00:11:01.387
you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country

00:11:01.387 --> 00:11:03.926
when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:06.322
to investigate that is, you need to have access to

00:11:06.322 --> 00:11:08.621
all of the world's, as many as you can,

00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:11.404
companies' house registrations databases.

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:15.842
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.097
databases into one place so you can start searching for,

00:11:19.097 --> 00:11:22.765
you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.516
You can try and find out how he's moving out assets

00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:28.242
from that country.

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:31.875
But again, when it comes to the decisions which are

00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:34.875
impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important

00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:38.164
decisions that are being made about war and so forth,

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:41.093
again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.

00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:44.201
It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on

00:11:44.201 --> 00:11:48.283
illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:51.325
So when the Guardian did this investigation about

00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:54.475
the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into

00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:57.939
the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.

00:11:57.939 --> 00:11:59.881
You know, they're just not going to get it.

00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:03.421
So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches

00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:05.827
that were written by American soldiers

00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:08.386
about the Afghan War, and leaked,

00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:12.037
and then they're able to do this investigation.

00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:17.605
Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:20.105
Again, this is all based around leaks,

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:25.356
251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:29.297
in this investigation because I got this leak

00:12:29.297 --> 00:12:32.666
through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:35.435
and ended up going to work at the Guardian.

00:12:35.435 --> 00:12:37.859
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:39.826
to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:43.476
It reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:12:43.476 --> 00:12:45.964
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:48.815
runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,

00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:50.277
the dog's pulling back the curtain, and --

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:54.260
"Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.396
It was just like that, because what you started to see

00:12:56.396 --> 00:12:59.347
is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous

00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:02.445
politicians, they were just like us.

00:13:02.445 --> 00:13:05.005
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,

00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:07.676
those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important

00:13:07.676 --> 00:13:10.277
point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings

00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:12.228
just like us. They don't have special powers.

00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:16.051
They're not magic. They are not our parents.

00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:20.900
Beyond that, what I found most fascinating

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.524
was the level of endemic corruption that I saw

00:13:23.524 --> 00:13:26.679
across all different countries, and particularly centered

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:29.507
around the heart of power, around public officials

00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:32.123
who were embezzling the public's money

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:35.141
for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that

00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:38.524
because of official secrecy.

00:13:38.524 --> 00:13:42.151
So I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be

00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:44.982
more open than publishing all the material?

00:13:44.982 --> 00:13:48.053
Because that is what Julian Assange did.

00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:50.621
He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:54.418
to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.

00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:58.133
That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan

00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:01.549
being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:05.319
was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners

00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:08.805
in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:13.277
Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,

00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:16.779
what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:20.533
responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner

00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:23.549
with power. It's about sharing responsibility,

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:26.461
sharing accountability. Also, the fact that

00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:28.598
he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,

00:14:28.598 --> 00:14:31.283
I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency

00:14:31.283 --> 00:14:37.124
in ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)

00:14:37.124 --> 00:14:40.458
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:43.126
and you must have two real qualities, I think,

00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:45.539
when you come to the table, when you're dealing

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:47.273
with power, talking about power,

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:49.646
because of its seductive capacity.

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:52.665
You've got to have skepticism and humility.

00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:55.258
Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.

00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:58.290
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.005
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:05.498
And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.

00:15:05.498 --> 00:15:08.290
And if you don't have skepticism and humility,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.385
then it's a really short journey to go from reformer

00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:15.994
to autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm"

00:15:15.994 --> 00:15:21.937
to get that message about how power corrupts people.

00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:27.405
So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody

00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:30.872
within the rule of law rights to information.

00:15:30.872 --> 00:15:33.507
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.

00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:36.489
In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,

00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:38.652
including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act

00:15:38.652 --> 00:15:41.768
with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,

00:15:41.768 --> 00:15:45.934
people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:50.137
for publishing or giving away official information.

00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:53.615
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want

00:15:53.615 --> 00:15:57.177
all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act

00:15:57.177 --> 00:16:00.553
where officials were punished if they were found

00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:03.513
to have suppressed or hidden information

00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:05.698
that was in the public interest?

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:12.598
So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)

00:16:12.598 --> 00:16:15.143
I would like us to work towards that.

00:16:15.143 --> 00:16:19.063
So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is

00:16:19.063 --> 00:16:22.018
progress on the line, but I think what we find is that

00:16:22.018 --> 00:16:25.194
the closer that we get right into the heart of power,

00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:29.618
the more opaque, closed it becomes.

00:16:29.618 --> 00:16:32.698
So it was only just the other week that I heard London's

00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:36.195
Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:40.787
the police need access to all of our communications,

00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:43.850
spying on us without any judicial oversight,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.516
and he said it was a matter of life and death.

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:48.763
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.

00:16:48.763 --> 00:16:52.985
There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.

00:16:52.985 --> 00:16:56.107
It was just, "Because I say so.

00:16:56.107 --> 00:16:59.355
You have to trust me. Take it on faith."

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:01.354
Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:05.059
to the pre-Enlightenment Church,

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:08.835
and we need to fight against that.

00:17:08.835 --> 00:17:12.123
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is

00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:16.349
the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.955
In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:23.595
You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.

00:17:23.595 --> 00:17:26.355
You have the National Security Agency building

00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:29.883
the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal --

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.355
it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,

00:17:32.355 --> 00:17:34.157
in which they're going to intercept and analyze

00:17:34.157 --> 00:17:37.106
communications, traffic and personal data

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:40.419
to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:45.219
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents

00:17:45.219 --> 00:17:49.069
have panicked. They've locked all the doors.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:52.155
They've kitted out the house with CCTV cameras.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.907
They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.571
and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms

00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:00.243
and figure out which ones of us are troublesome,

00:18:00.243 --> 00:18:04.477
and if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.

00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:08.051
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?

00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:11.710
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.457
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,

00:18:14.457 --> 00:18:16.955
indeed, very grim.

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:22.177
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal

00:18:22.177 --> 00:18:24.981
than we want to acknowledge.

00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:27.270
Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe,

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.981
but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,

00:18:30.981 --> 00:18:34.830
with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.323
with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them

00:18:37.323 --> 00:18:41.394
and live in a world in which we can all be

00:18:41.394 --> 00:18:45.080
happily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.315
(Applause)

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:52.370
Thank you. (Applause)
