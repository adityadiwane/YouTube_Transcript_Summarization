00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:18.126
I want to discuss with you this afternoon

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.588
why you're going to fail
to have a great career.

00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:21.987
(Laughter)

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:24.205
I'm an economist.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.089
I do dismal.

00:00:26.823 --> 00:00:30.394
End of the day, it's ready
for dismal remarks.

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:34.844
I only want to talk to those of you
who want a great career.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.907
I know some of you have already decided
you want a good career.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:40.321
You're going to fail, too.

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:41.416
(Laughter)

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.049
Because -- goodness,
you're all cheery about failing.

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:45.082
(Laughter)

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:46.908
Canadian group, undoubtedly.

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:50.058
(Laughter)

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.900
Those trying to have good careers
are going to fail,

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:55.844
because, really, good jobs
are now disappearing.

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:59.634
There are great jobs and great careers,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.290
and then there are the high-workload,

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:06.790
high-stress, bloodsucking,
soul-destroying kinds of jobs,

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:08.515
and practically nothing in-between.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.940
So people looking for good jobs
are going to fail.

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:14.146
I want to talk about those
looking for great jobs, great careers,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.026
and why you're going to fail.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:23.899
First reason is that no matter
how many times people tell you,

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:27.153
"If you want a great career,
you have to pursue your passion,

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:30.422
you have to pursue your dreams,
you have to pursue

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:33.414
the greatest fascination in your life,"

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:36.693
you hear it again and again,
and then you decide not to do it.

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:40.041
It doesn't matter
how many times you download

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:44.240
Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:47.076
you still look at it
and decide not to do it.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.790
I'm not quite sure
why you decide not to do it.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.891
You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:54.782
You're afraid if you look
for your passion and don't find it,

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:57.536
you'll feel like you're an idiot,
so then you make excuses

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.282
about why you're not going
to look for your passion.

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.202
They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.401
We're going to go through
a whole long list --

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:08.691
your creativity in thinking of excuses
not to do what you really need to do

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:10.937
if you want to have a great career.

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:16.585
So, for example,
one of your great excuses is:

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:17.966
(Sigh)

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.745
"Well, great careers are
really and truly, for most people,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.896
just a matter of luck.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.992
So I'm going to stand around,
I'm going to try to be lucky,

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:29.262
and if I'm lucky,
I'll have a great career.

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:30.896
If not, I'll have a good career."

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.523
But a good career is an impossibility,
so that's not going to work.

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:36.198
Then, your other excuse is,

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.784
"Yes, there are special people
who pursue their passions,

00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:42.142
but they are geniuses.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.720
They are Steven J.

00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:45.347
I'm not a genius.

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:47.978
When I was five, I thought I was a genius,

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.922
but my professors have beaten that idea
out of my head long since."

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.301
(Laughter)

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:57.817
"And now I know
I am completely competent."

00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.523
Now, you see, if this was 1950,

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.563
being completely competent --

00:03:03.587 --> 00:03:05.629
that would have given you a great career.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:06.806
But guess what?

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.551
This is almost 2012,
and saying to the world,

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.890
"I am totally, completely competent,"

00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:17.995
is damning yourself
with the faintest of praise.

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:20.392
And then, of course, another excuse:

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:23.972
"Well, I would do this,
I would do this, but, but --

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:27.503
well, after all, I'm not weird.

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:30.653
Everybody knows that people
who pursue their passions

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.080
are somewhat obsessive.

00:03:32.104 --> 00:03:33.573
A little strange.

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:35.232
Hmm? Hmm? Okay?

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.478
You know, a fine line
between madness and genius.

00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:42.787
"I'm not weird. I've read
Steven J.'s biography.

00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:46.670
Oh my goodness --
I'm not that person. I am nice.

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.028
I am normal.

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:51.850
I'm a nice, normal person,
and nice, normal people --

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:54.550
don't have passion."

00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:55.598
(Laughter)

00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:58.123
"Ah, but I still want a great career.

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:00.076
I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.631
so I know what I'm going to do,

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.519
because I have a solution.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:04.995
I have a strategy.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.433
It's the one Mommy
and Daddy told me about.

00:04:07.457 --> 00:04:10.512
Mommy and Daddy told me
that if I worked hard,

00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:12.290
I'd have a good career.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.615
So, if you work hard
and have a good career,

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.647
if you work really, really, really hard,

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:18.992
you'll have a great career.

00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:21.432
Doesn't that, like,
mathematically make sense?"

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:22.940
Hmm. Not.

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:25.429
But you've managed
to talk yourself into that.

00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:27.529
You know what? Here's a little secret:

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:30.623
You want to work? You want to work
really, really, really hard?

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.100
You know what? You'll succeed.

00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:34.030
The world will give you the opportunity

00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:37.669
to work really, really,
really, really hard.

00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:40.633
But, are you so sure

00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:43.577
that that's going to give you
a great career,

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:46.419
when all the evidence is to the contrary?

00:04:46.443 --> 00:04:51.946
So let's deal with those of you
who are trying to find your passion.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.643
You actually understand
that you really had better do it,

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:55.993
never mind the excuses.

00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:58.005
You're trying to find your passion --

00:04:58.658 --> 00:04:59.659
(Sigh)

00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:01.063
and you're so happy.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.101
You found something you're interested in.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.166
"I have an interest! I have an interest!"

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.348
You tell me.

00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:10.395
You say, "I have an interest!"
I say, "That's wonderful!

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.666
And what are you trying to tell me?"

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.205
"Well, I have an interest."

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.789
I say, "Do you have passion?"

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:17.432
"I have an interest," you say.

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:19.744
"Your interest is compared to what?"

00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:21.670
"Well, I'm interested in this."

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.977
"And what about the rest
of humanity's activities?"

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:27.796
"I'm not interested in them."

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.923
"You've looked at them all, have you?"

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:32.050
"No. Not exactly."

00:05:32.693 --> 00:05:34.732
Passion is your greatest love.

00:05:35.327 --> 00:05:37.581
Passion is the thing

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:42.625
that will help you create
the highest expression of your talent.

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.220
Passion, interest --
it's not the same thing.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.775
Are you really going to go
to your sweetie and say,

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:50.658
"Marry me! You're interesting."

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:53.792
(Laughter)

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.752
Won't happen.

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:57.870
Won't happen, and you will die alone.

00:05:57.894 --> 00:05:59.236
(Laughter)

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.545
What you want,

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.077
what you want, what you want,

00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:04.489
is passion.

00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:06.323
It is beyond interest.

00:06:06.347 --> 00:06:09.973
You need 20 interests,
and then one of them,

00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:11.743
one of them might grab you,

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:14.347
one of them might engage you
more than anything else,

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.965
and then you may have found
your greatest love,

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:21.180
in comparison to all the other things
that interest you,

00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:22.921
and that's what passion is.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.976
I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.839
He was an economically rational person.

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:31.909
He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.

00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:35.601
Let us merge our interests."

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.497
(Laughter)

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:38.672
Yes, he did.

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.990
"I love you truly," he said.
"I love you deeply.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:47.290
I love you more than any other woman
I've ever encountered.

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:51.867
I love you more than Mary,
Jane, Susie, Penelope,

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.907
Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --

00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.383
I was on a German exchange program then.

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:59.446
I love you more than --"

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.019
All right.

00:07:01.043 --> 00:07:02.424
She left the room

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:07.016
halfway through his enumeration
of his love for her.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.952
After he got over his surprise
at being, you know, turned down,

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:15.721
he concluded he'd had a narrow escape

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:19.036
from marrying an irrational person.

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:22.901
Although, he did make a note to himself
that the next time he proposed,

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.584
it was perhaps not necessary

00:07:24.608 --> 00:07:29.767
to enumerate all of the women
he had auditioned for the part.

00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:31.882
(Laughter)

00:07:31.906 --> 00:07:33.346
But the point stands.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.011
You must look for alternatives
so that you find your destiny,

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:39.670
or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:42.530
Does the word "destiny" scare you?

00:07:42.554 --> 00:07:44.116
That's what we're talking about.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.085
And if you don't find
the highest expression of your talent,

00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:50.283
if you settle for "interesting,"
what the hell ever that means,

00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:53.466
do you know what will happen
at the end of your long life?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.704
Your friends and family will be
gathered in the cemetery,

00:07:56.728 --> 00:08:00.220
and there beside your gravesite
will be a tombstone,

00:08:00.244 --> 00:08:01.846
and inscribed on that tombstone

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.721
it will say, "Here lies
a distinguished engineer,

00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:07.545
who invented Velcro."

00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:14.474
But what that tombstone should have said,

00:08:14.498 --> 00:08:17.172
in an alternative lifetime,

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:21.648
what it should have said if it was
your highest expression of talent,

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:26.224
was, "Here lies the last
Nobel Laureate in Physics,

00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:29.589
who formulated
the Grand Unified Field Theory

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:33.016
and demonstrated
the practicality of warp drive."

00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:35.781
(Laughter)

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:37.552
Velcro, indeed!

00:08:37.576 --> 00:08:39.061
(Laughter)

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.519
One was a great career.

00:08:43.694 --> 00:08:47.046
One was a missed opportunity.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.042
But then, there are some of you who,

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:53.422
in spite of all these
excuses, you will find,

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.461
you will find your passion.

00:08:56.997 --> 00:08:59.009
And you'll still fail.

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:03.043
You're going to fail, because --

00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:06.619
because you're not going to do it,

00:09:06.643 --> 00:09:10.627
because you will have
invented a new excuse,

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.428
any excuse to fail to take action,

00:09:14.452 --> 00:09:18.546
and this excuse, I've heard so many times:

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:25.472
"Yes, I would pursue a great career,

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:32.233
but, I value human relationships --

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:33.258
(Laughter)

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:34.790
more than accomplishment.

00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:37.752
I want to be a great friend.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.020
I want to be a great spouse.

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:41.893
I want to be a great parent,

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:44.036
and I will not sacrifice them

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.050
on the altar of great accomplishment."

00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:49.703
(Laughter)

00:09:49.727 --> 00:09:51.227
What do you want me to say?

00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:54.013
Now, do you really want
me to say now, tell you,

00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:56.536
"Really, I swear I don't kick children."

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.513
(Laughter)

00:09:59.227 --> 00:10:01.989
Look at the worldview
you've given yourself.

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:04.074
You're a hero no matter what.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.222
And I, by suggesting ever so delicately

00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:11.420
that you might want a great career,
must hate children.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.453
I don't hate children. I don't kick them.

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:16.372
Yes, there was a little kid
wandering through this building

00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:18.820
when I came here, and no,
I didn't kick him.

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:20.287
(Laughter)

00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:23.423
Course, I had to tell him
the building was for adults only,

00:10:23.447 --> 00:10:25.049
and to get out.

00:10:25.073 --> 00:10:26.969
He mumbled something about his mother,

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:30.517
and I told him she'd probably
find him outside anyway.

00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:33.225
Last time I saw him,
he was on the stairs crying.

00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:34.337
(Laughter)

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:35.518
What a wimp.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:36.549
(Laughter)

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:39.165
But what do you mean?
That's what you expect me to say.

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:41.166
Do you really think it's appropriate

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.803
that you should actually take
children and use them as a shield?

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:50.041
You know what will happen someday,

00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:53.064
you ideal parent, you?

00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:57.088
The kid will come to you someday and say,

00:10:57.112 --> 00:10:59.524
"I know what I want to be.

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:01.563
I know what I'm going to do with my life."

00:11:01.587 --> 00:11:02.762
You are so happy.

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:05.008
It's the conversation
a parent wants to hear,

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.889
because your kid's good in math,

00:11:06.913 --> 00:11:09.706
and you know you're going to like
what comes next.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.188
Says your kid,

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.615
"I have decided I want to be a magician.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:17.760
I want to perform
magic tricks on the stage."

00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:20.759
(Laughter)

00:11:20.783 --> 00:11:22.347
And what do you say?

00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:25.631
You say, you say,

00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:28.978
"That's risky, kid.

00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:31.801
Might fail, kid. Don't make
a lot of money at that, kid.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:34.793
I don't know, kid, you should
think about that again, kid.

00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:36.792
You're so good at math, why don't you --"

00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.350
The kid interrupts you and says,

00:11:38.374 --> 00:11:41.722
"But it is my dream.
It is my dream to do this."

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.311
And what are you going to say?

00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:45.977
You know what you're going to say?

00:11:46.001 --> 00:11:48.507
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --

00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:51.769
But --"

00:11:51.793 --> 00:11:54.693
So how are you going to finish
the sentence with your "but"?

00:11:54.717 --> 00:11:59.998
"But. I had a dream too, once,
kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."

00:12:00.781 --> 00:12:03.360
Or are you going to tell him this:

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:05.036
"I had a dream once, kid.

00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:08.703
But then, you were born."

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.037
(Laughter)

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:13.703
(Applause)

00:12:13.727 --> 00:12:18.774
Do you really want to use your family,

00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:23.345
do you really ever want to look
at your spouse and your kid,

00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:24.918
and see your jailers?

00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:30.212
There was something
you could have said to your kid,

00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:32.926
when he or she said, "I have a dream."

00:12:34.012 --> 00:12:35.948
You could have said --

00:12:35.972 --> 00:12:39.993
looked the kid in the face and said,

00:12:40.017 --> 00:12:41.799
"Go for it, kid!

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.866
Just like I did."

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.151
But you won't be able to say that,

00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:50.833
because you didn't.

00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:52.432
So you can't.

00:12:52.456 --> 00:12:54.421
(Laughter)

00:12:57.086 --> 00:13:00.253
And so the sins of the parents

00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:02.404
are visited on the poor children.

00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:09.800
Why will you seek refuge
in human relationships

00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:15.753
as your excuse not to find
and pursue your passion?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.815
You know why.

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:20.879
In your heart of hearts, you know why,

00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:23.125
and I'm being deadly serious.

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:25.837
You know why you would get
all warm and fuzzy

00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:28.756
and wrap yourself
up in human relationships.

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:31.527
It is because you are --

00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:34.302
you know what you are.

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:37.702
You're afraid to pursue your passion.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.212
You're afraid to look ridiculous.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.744
You're afraid to try.

00:13:41.768 --> 00:13:43.575
You're afraid you may fail.

00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:53.218
Great friend, great spouse,
great parent, great career.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:57.232
Is that not a package?
Is that not who you are?

00:13:58.253 --> 00:14:00.122
How can you be one without the other?

00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:03.031
But you're afraid.

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:09.020
And that's why you're not
going to have a great career.

00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:13.768
Unless --

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:18.979
"unless," that most evocative
of all English words --

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.466
"unless."

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:25.804
But the "unless" word is also attached

00:14:25.828 --> 00:14:30.780
to that other, most terrifying phrase,

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.693
"If only I had ..."

00:14:33.463 --> 00:14:36.167
"If only I had ..."

00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:41.437
If you ever have that thought
ricocheting in your brain,

00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:43.818
it will hurt a lot.

00:14:45.007 --> 00:14:47.635
So, those are the many reasons

00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:49.635
why you are going to fail

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.301
to have a great career.

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:54.590
Unless --

00:14:58.698 --> 00:14:59.857
Unless.

00:15:01.912 --> 00:15:03.064
Thank you.

00:15:03.088 --> 00:15:06.025
(Applause)
