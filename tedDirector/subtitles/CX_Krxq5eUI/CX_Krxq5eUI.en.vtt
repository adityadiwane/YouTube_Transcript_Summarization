00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:19.902
Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion,

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:21.256
namely road congestion.

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.517
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:26.377
It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,

00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:28.325
which is a little bit surprising when you think about it.

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.288
I mean, think about how different cities are, actually.

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:33.050
I mean, you have the typical European cities,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.042
with a dense urban core, good public transportation

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:38.497
mostly, not a lot of road capacity.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.946
But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.737
It's moving by itself, okay.

00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:46.743
Anyway, the American cities:

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.671
lots of roads dispersed over large areas,

00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:51.130
almost no public transportation.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.340
And then you have the emerging world cities,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.866
with a mixed variety of vehicles,

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.408
mixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed

00:00:57.408 --> 00:01:00.007
but often with a very dense urban core.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.409
And traffic planners all around the world have tried

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.063
lots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:08.614
lots of roads or lots of public transport

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.400
or lots of bike lanes or more information,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.194
or lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.197
But all of these attempts have one thing in common.

00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:20.548
They're basically attempts at figuring out

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.875
what people should do instead of rush hour car driving.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.987
They're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:30.189
what other people should do, planning their life for them.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.641
Now, planning a complex social system

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.716
is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:38.443
Back in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:41.065
an urban planner in London got a phone call

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.615
from a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.133
"Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.155
who's in charge of London's bread supply?"

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:50.808
And the urban planner in London goes,

00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:52.778
"What do you mean, who's in charge of London's â€”

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.049
I mean, no one is in charge."

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.931
"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge.

00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:59.587
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:02.693
"No. No. No one is in charge.

00:02:02.693 --> 00:02:05.294
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it.

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:07.883
It basically organizes itself."

00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:10.460
It organizes itself.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.303
That's an example of a complex social system

00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:16.031
which has the ability of self-organizing,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.619
and this is a very deep insight.

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.932
When you try to solve really complex social problems,

00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:23.648
the right thing to do is most of the time

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:25.239
to create the incentives.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.183
You don't plan the details,

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:29.803
and people will figure out what to do,

00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:31.663
how to adapt to this new framework.

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:35.154
And let's now look at how we can use this insight

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.790
to combat road congestion.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.022
This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.

00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:42.663
Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:45.452
but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water

00:02:45.452 --> 00:02:48.729
means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges --

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.764
which means lots of road congestion.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:55.404
And these red dots show the most congested parts,

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:57.981
which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.507
And then someone came up with the idea that,

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:02.344
apart from good public transport,

00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:04.945
apart from spending money on roads,

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:09.160
let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.084
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:14.741
I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,

00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.459
so you would probably expect that car drivers

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.897
wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:21.197
You would be wrong.

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:25.225
One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.609
disappear from rush hours.

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.160
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.367
but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:35.236
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.503
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:41.195
a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that

00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:44.336
once you reach above a certain capacity threshold

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:47.504
then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:49.964
But fortunately, it also works the other way around.

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:53.295
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.924
will go down much faster than you might think.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.815
Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:04.419
on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.402
of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:12.215
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:15.135
This is what happens when you take away

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:17.200
20 percent of the cars from the streets.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.910
You really reduce congestion quite substantially.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.568
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:26.070
So after a while they would all come back because they

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.018
have sort of gotten used to charges.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:31.694
Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago

00:04:31.694 --> 00:04:33.677
since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,

00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:37.666
and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:39.937
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:41.400
in 2007.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.789
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.885
they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:50.854
in January and then abolished again at the end of July,

00:04:50.854 --> 00:04:53.448
followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:57.648
again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.

00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:01.785
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:03.566
and we actually got to do it twice.

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.675
And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:07.163
but they won't let me do that.

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.348
But it was fun anyway.

00:05:09.348 --> 00:05:12.733
So, we followed up. What happened?

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:16.599
This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.377
and you see the same street but now it's summer,

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.121
and summer in Stockholm is a very nice

00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.371
and light time of the year,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:25.214
and the first day without the congestion charges

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:26.581
looked like this.

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.244
All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire

00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:32.154
the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.

00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:34.401
The first day they all came back.

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:39.751
And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:42.082
Now these traffic figures are really exciting

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:44.733
and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:47.492
but I would say that the most surprising slide here

00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:51.522
I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.

00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:54.853
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,

00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:57.522
and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced

00:05:57.522 --> 00:06:01.839
in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.867
Seventy percent of the population didn't want this.

00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:06.515
But what happened when the congestion charges

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:09.976
were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:13.129
No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.830
where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.671
meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that:

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.478
70 percent of the population in Stockholm

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:25.471
want to keep a price for something that used to be free.

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:29.097
Okay. So why can that be? Why is that?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.097
Well, think about it this way. Who changed?

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:34.723
I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:36.668
surely they must be discontent in a way.

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:39.002
And where did they go? If we can understand this,

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:43.132
then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.

00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:45.534
Well, so we did this huge interview survey

00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:47.369
with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:49.124
who changed, and where did they go?

00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:53.538
And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:58.386
For some reason, the car drivers are --

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:01.882
they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.

00:07:01.882 --> 00:07:04.138
And why is that? It's because that travel patterns

00:07:04.138 --> 00:07:06.537
are much less stable than you might think.

00:07:06.537 --> 00:07:09.368
Each day, people make new decisions, and people change

00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.793
and the world changes around them, and each day

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:15.046
all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:17.013
away from rush hour car driving

00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:19.597
in a way that people don't even notice.

00:07:19.597 --> 00:07:21.642
They're not even aware of this themselves.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:24.443
And the other question, who changed their mind?

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.409
Who changed their opinion, and why?

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.935
So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:33.311
why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:36.204
And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that

00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:40.089
more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:42.376
They're actually confident that they have

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:45.065
liked congestion pricing all along.

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.784
Which means that we are now in a position

00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:49.777
where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:52.988
with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,

00:07:52.988 --> 00:07:56.535
and people aren't even aware that they have changed,

00:07:56.535 --> 00:08:00.446
and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.920
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.552
complex social problems, and when you do that,

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:10.182
you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.

00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:12.369
You should just nudge them in the right direction.

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:14.091
And if you do it right,

00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.143
people will actually embrace the change,

00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:19.205
and if you do it right, people will actually even like it.

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:22.530
Thank you. (Applause)
