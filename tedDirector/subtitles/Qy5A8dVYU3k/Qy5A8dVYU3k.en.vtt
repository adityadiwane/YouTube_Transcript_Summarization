00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.826
So, people want a lot of things out of life,

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:22.721
but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:26.049
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:29.321
towards which all other things aim.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:34.841
According to this view, the reason we want a big house

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.474
or a nice car

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.554
or a good job

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:42.002
isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.520
It's that we expect them to bring us

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.977
happiness.

00:00:45.977 --> 00:00:48.609
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.636
a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:53.713
We live longer. We have access to technology

00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:55.880
that would have seemed like science fiction

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.121
just a few years ago.

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.545
The paradox of happiness is that even though the

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.447
objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:07.011
we haven't actually gotten any happier.

00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:09.930
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.406
haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.536
there's been an increased interest in recent years

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:17.058
in happiness itself.

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:19.093
People have been debating the causes of happiness

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:21.692
for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:25.149
but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.208
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.420
the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.954
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.755
in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:38.867
about its demographics, how things like income

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:42.293
and education, gender and marriage relate to it.

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:44.515
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.454
factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:49.891
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.603
or to graduate from college instead of dropping out,

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:55.364
but the differences in happiness tend to be small.

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:59.199
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.896
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:04.608
but I think something that has the potential to be an answer

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.329
is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.773
the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.

00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:11.768
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.703
that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:18.055
have a big influence on our happiness, and yet

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.288
these are the very factors that have been very difficult,

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:22.675
in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.736
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:28.315
moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:31.057
on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:33.848
been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:38.134
it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.

00:02:38.134 --> 00:02:40.923
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:43.363
at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.651
a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:48.185
at the instant just before the signal.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:50.992
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:53.616
goes up and down over the course of the day,

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:55.344
minute to minute in some cases,

00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:57.486
and try to understand how what people are doing,

00:02:57.486 --> 00:03:00.329
who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.505
the other factors that describe our day, how those might

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:05.216
relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:06.762
to discover some of the things that really have

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:09.067
a big influence on happiness.

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:11.373
We've been fortunate with this project to collect

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:14.231
quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.090
has ever been collected before,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.311
over 650,000 real-time reports

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:22.190
from over 15,000 people.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.299
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.786
people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.714
a wide range of incomes, education levels,

00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.777
people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.041
They collectively represent every one of

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:41.902
86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:44.804
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:46.933
is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:50.116
investigating, and that's mind-wandering.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:52.516
As human beings, we have this unique ability

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:55.451
to have our minds stray away from the present.

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.376
This guy is sitting here working on his computer,

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.430
and yet he could be thinking about

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.119
the vacation he had last month,

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.082
wondering what he's going to have for dinner.

00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:06.915
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.700
This ability to focus our attention on something other

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.955
than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:17.449
and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.847
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is

00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:23.763
between our use of this ability and our happiness.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.621
You've probably heard people suggest that you should

00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:28.112
stay focused on the present. "Be here now,"

00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:29.597
you've probably heard a hundred times.

00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:32.278
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.789
immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.623
Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering

00:04:37.623 --> 00:04:39.353
is a bad thing.

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:41.772
On the other hand, when our minds wander,

00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:44.433
they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:47.821
in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.634
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:52.325
when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.558
that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.

00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:56.056
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind

00:04:56.056 --> 00:05:00.482
allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:02.493
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to

00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:05.170
resolve this debate with some data, and in particular

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.658
I'd like to present some data to you from three questions

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.868
that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from

00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:12.520
sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.550
There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.425
How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.564
to very good? Second, an activity question:

00:05:22.564 --> 00:05:25.092
What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:28.317
including things like eating and working and watching TV?

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:31.905
And finally a mind-wandering question:

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.547
Are you thinking about something other

00:05:34.547 --> 00:05:37.170
than what you're currently doing?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.612
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --

00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:43.141
or yes -- I am thinking about something else --

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.597
and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:47.023
neutral or unpleasant.

00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:52.482
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.

00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:54.947
So what did we find?

00:05:54.947 --> 00:05:57.246
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.486
and you can see that bar there representing how happy

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:00.819
people are when they're focused on the present,

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.742
when they're not mind-wandering.

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:06.461
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy

00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:11.197
when their minds are wandering than when they're not.

00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:13.799
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:16.221
on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,

00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.889
but surely when their minds are straying away

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.008
from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,

00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:23.772
at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.

00:06:23.772 --> 00:06:26.471
Nope. As it turns out,

00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:28.163
people are less happy when they're mind-wandering

00:06:28.163 --> 00:06:31.189
no matter what they're doing. For example,

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.366
people don't really like commuting to work very much.

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:36.126
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:38.660
they are substantially happier when they're focused

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.022
only on their commute than when their mind is going

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:44.069
off to something else.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.851
It's amazing.

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:49.696
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,

00:06:49.696 --> 00:06:52.094
a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.950
we often think about unpleasant things, and they are

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.557
enormously less happy when they do that,

00:06:58.557 --> 00:07:01.222
our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,

00:07:01.222 --> 00:07:04.182
and yet even when people are thinking about something

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:07.046
neutral, they're still considerably less happy

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:09.023
than when they're not mind-wandering at all.

00:07:09.023 --> 00:07:11.858
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,

00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:14.062
they're actually just slightly less happy

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:17.319
than when they aren't mind-wandering.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.381
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like

00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:22.414
having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars

00:07:22.414 --> 00:07:28.565
or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)

00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:31.238
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,

00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:34.050
that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.817
I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:39.602
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case

00:07:39.602 --> 00:07:42.056
that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:44.425
Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:47.514
disentangle these two possibilites?

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:49.858
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact

00:07:49.858 --> 00:07:52.815
you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not

00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:56.812
backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.

00:07:56.812 --> 00:08:00.242
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,

00:08:00.242 --> 00:08:03.438
and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering

00:08:03.438 --> 00:08:05.931
tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.114
tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight

00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:10.275
into the causal direction.

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:13.484
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between

00:08:13.484 --> 00:08:17.169
mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:20.888
consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.

00:08:20.888 --> 00:08:24.048
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy

00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:27.057
now and mind-wandering a short time later.

00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:29.379
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:35.219
an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.443
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering

00:08:37.443 --> 00:08:39.706
to a slot machine you'd never want to play.

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.010
Well, how often do people's minds wander?

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.467
Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.161
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.568
about something other than what they're currently doing.

00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:55.006
How does that depend on what people are doing?

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:57.759
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:01.758
ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) —

00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:04.270
when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.171
to 50 percent when they're working,

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.214
to 40 percent when they're exercising,

00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:12.133
all the way down to this one short bar on the right

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:14.121
that I think some of you are probably laughing at.

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:16.511
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering

00:09:16.511 --> 00:09:21.082
when they're having sex. (Laughter)

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:24.015
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,

00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:27.063
and that is, basically with one exception,

00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:29.241
no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:32.919
at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:35.750
that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.483
It pervades basically everything that we do.

00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:42.679
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.729
a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:46.385
in the equation for happiness.

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.400
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.448
moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences

00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:54.850
in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.780
and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.477
will help us create a future that's not only richer

00:10:00.477 --> 00:10:03.339
and healthier, but happier as well.

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:06.563
Thank you. (Applause)

00:10:06.563 --> 00:10:10.563
(Applause)
