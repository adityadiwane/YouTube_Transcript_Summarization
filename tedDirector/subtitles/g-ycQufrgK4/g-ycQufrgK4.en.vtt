00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.825
Have you ever experienced
a moment in your life

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.855
that was so painful and confusing,

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.074
that all you wanted to do

00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:25.795
was learn as much as you could
to make sense of it all?

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:30.441
When I was 13, a close family friend
who was like an uncle to me

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:32.495
passed away from pancreatic cancer.

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:35.742
When the disease hit so close to home,

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.825
I knew I needed to learn more.

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.879
So I went online to find answers.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:45.461
Using the Internet, I found a variety
of statistics on pancreatic cancer,

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:47.465
and what I had found shocked me.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.387
Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers
are diagnosed late,

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.461
when someone has less
than a two percent chance of survival.

00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:00.802
Why are we so bad at detecting
pancreatic cancer?

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:03.653
The reason?

00:01:03.677 --> 00:01:07.498
Today's current "modern" medicine
is a 60-year-old technique.

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.164
That's older than my dad.

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:12.801
(Laughter)

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:19.540
But also, it's extremely expensive,
costing 800 dollars per test,

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:24.604
and it's grossly inaccurate, missing
30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.536
Your doctor would have to be ridiculously
suspicious that you have the cancer

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.253
in order to give you this test.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.888
Learning this, I knew there
had to be a better way.

00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:37.835
So, I set up scientific criteria

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.945
as to what a sensor
would have to look like

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.839
in order to effectively
diagnose pancreatic cancer.

00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:44.929
The sensor would have to be:

00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:49.681
inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.329
selective, and minimally invasive.

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:59.114
Now, there's a reason why this test
hasn't been updated in over six decades.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.353
And that's because when
we're looking for pancreatic cancer,

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.065
we're looking at your bloodstream,

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:08.815
which is already abundant in all these
tons and tons of protein,

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:12.614
and you're looking for this miniscule
difference in this tiny amount of protein.

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:13.788
Just this one protein.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:15.617
That's next to impossible.

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:19.775
However, undeterred
due to my teenage optimism --

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:20.985
(Laughter)

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:25.580
(Applause)

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:30.835
I went online to a teenager's
two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.775
I got everything for my homework
from those two sources.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.949
(Laughter)

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.629
And what I had found was an article

00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:41.500
that listed a database
of over 8,000 different proteins

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:43.715
that are found when you have
pancreatic cancer.

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:47.424
So, I decided to go
and make it my new mission

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:49.181
to go through all these proteins,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:52.536
and see which ones could serve
as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.363
And to make it a bit simpler for myself,

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:59.140
I decided to map out
scientific criteria, and here it is.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.745
Essentially, first, the protein would have
to be found in all pancreatic cancers,

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.512
at high levels in the bloodstream,

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:09.037
in the earliest stages,
but also only in cancer.

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:12.912
And so I'm just plugging and chugging
through this gargantuan task,

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:15.795
and finally, on the 4,000th try,

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.735
when I'm close to losing my sanity,

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.909
I find the protein.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:23.365
And the name of the protein
I'd located was called mesothelin,

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.254
and it's just your ordinary,
run-of-the-mill type protein,

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:29.542
unless, of course, you have
pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:32.901
in which case it's found at these
very high levels in your bloodstream.

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:37.584
But also, the key is that it's found
in the earliest stages of the disease,

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:40.368
when someone has close
to 100 percent chance of survival.

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:44.465
So now that I'd found
a reliable protein I could detect,

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.426
I then shifted my focus
to actually detecting that protein,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.784
and thus, pancreatic cancer.

00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:53.080
Now, my breakthrough
came in a very unlikely place,

00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:56.111
possibly the most unlikely
place for innovation --

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:00.258
my high school biology class,
the absolute stifler of innovation.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.815
(Laughter)

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.809
(Applause)

00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.789
And I had snuck in this article
on these things called carbon nanotubes,

00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:12.270
and that's just a long,
thin pipe of carbon

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:16.068
that's an atom thick, and one
50,000th the diameter of your hair.

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:18.528
And despite their extremely small sizes,

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:20.499
they have these incredible properties.

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:23.242
They're kind of like the superheroes
of material science.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:27.313
And while I was sneakily reading this
article under my desk in my biology class,

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:31.099
we were supposed to be paying attention
to these other kind of cool molecules,

00:04:31.123 --> 00:04:32.279
called antibodies.

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:34.805
And these are pretty cool
because they only react

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.366
with one specific protein,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.136
but they're not nearly
as interesting as carbon nanotubes.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.825
And so then, I was sitting in class,
and suddenly it hit me:

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.805
I could combine what I was
reading about, carbon nanotubes,

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:51.845
with what I was supposed to be
thinking about, antibodies.

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.530
Essentially, I could weave
a bunch of these antibodies

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:56.765
into a network of carbon nanotubes,

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.415
such that you have a network
that only reacts with one protein,

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.795
but also, due to the properties
of these nanotubes,

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.795
it will change its electrical properties,

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.809
based on the amount of protein present.

00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:09.890
However, there's a catch.

00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:13.480
These networks of carbon
nanotubes are extremely flimsy.

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:16.801
And since they're so delicate,
they need to be supported.

00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.878
So that's why I chose to use paper.

00:05:19.532 --> 00:05:22.499
Making a cancer sensor
out of paper is about as simple

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:24.714
as making chocolate chip
cookies, which I love.

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:27.296
(Laughs)

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.845
You start with some water,
pour in some nanotubes,

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:35.845
add antibodies, mix it up,
take some paper, dip it, dry it,

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.533
and you can detect cancer.

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:45.616
(Applause)

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.835
Then, suddenly, a thought occurred

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:52.759
that kind of put a blemish
on my amazing plan here.

00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:56.215
I can't really do cancer research
on my kitchen countertop.

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:57.811
My mom wouldn't really like that.

00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:01.587
So instead, I decided to go for a lab.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.213
So I typed up a budget, a materials list,
a timeline, and a procedure,

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:08.909
and I emailed it
to 200 different professors

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:12.208
at Johns Hopkins University
and the National Institutes of Health --

00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:15.462
essentially, anyone that had anything
to do with pancreatic cancer.

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:18.611
I sat back waiting for these
positive emails to be pouring in,

00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:21.432
saying, "You're a genius!
You're going to save us all!"

00:06:21.456 --> 00:06:22.727
And --

00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:25.517
(Laughter)

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:29.631
Then reality took hold,
and over the course of a month,

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:34.211
I got 199 rejections
out of those 200 emails.

00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:36.751
One professor even went
through my entire procedure,

00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:39.872
painstakingly -- I'm not really
sure where he got all this time --

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:43.484
and he went through and said
why each and every step

00:06:43.508 --> 00:06:45.604
was like the worst mistake
I could ever make.

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:50.710
Clearly, the professors did not have
as high of an opinion of my work as I did.

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.324
However, there is a silver lining.

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:57.315
One professor said, "Maybe I might
be able to help you, kid."

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:58.720
So, I went in that direction.

00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:03.657
(Laughter)

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:05.702
As you can never say no to a kid.

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:08.745
And so then, three months later,

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.640
I finally nailed down
a harsh deadline with this guy,

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:15.234
and I get into his lab, I get
all excited, and then I sit down,

00:07:15.258 --> 00:07:17.138
I start opening my mouth and talking,

00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:19.610
and five seconds later,
he calls in another Ph.D.

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:23.368
Ph.D.s just flock into this little room,

00:07:23.392 --> 00:07:25.536
and they're just firing
these questions at me,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.360
and by the end, I kind of felt
like I was in a clown car.

00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:30.576
There were 20 Ph.D.s,
plus me and the professor

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.442
crammed into this tiny office space,

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:35.443
with them firing these
rapid-fire questions at me,

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:37.493
trying to sink my procedure.

00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:39.667
How unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.

00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:43.739
(Laughter)

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.356
However, subjecting myself
to that interrogation --

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.327
I answered all their questions,
and I guessed on quite a few

00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:51.598
but I got them right --

00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:55.200
and I finally landed
the lab space I needed.

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:59.615
But it was shortly afterwards that
I discovered my once brilliant procedure

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.765
had something like a million holes in it,

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:03.550
and over the course of seven months,

00:08:03.574 --> 00:08:06.509
I painstakingly filled
each and every one of those holes.

00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:07.760
The result?

00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:12.610
One small paper sensor that costs
three cents and takes five minutes to run.

00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.406
This makes it 168 times faster,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.229
over 26,000 times less expensive,

00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:22.775
and over 400 times more sensitive
than our current standard

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:24.759
for pancreatic cancer detection.

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:32.735
(Applause)

00:08:34.738 --> 00:08:37.055
One of the best parts
of the sensor, though,

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.580
is that it has close
to 100 percent accuracy,

00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:42.290
and can detect the cancer
in the earliest stages,

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:44.998
when someone has close
to 100 percent chance of survival.

00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:47.443
And so in the next two to five years,

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.802
this sensor could potentially lift
the pancreatic cancer survival rates

00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:54.924
from a dismal 5.5 percent
to close to 100 percent,

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:57.603
and it would do similar
for ovarian and lung cancer.

00:08:58.091 --> 00:08:59.955
But it wouldn't stop there.

00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:01.899
By switching out that antibody,

00:09:01.923 --> 00:09:05.429
you can look at a different protein,
thus, a different disease --

00:09:05.453 --> 00:09:08.371
potentially any disease
in the entire world.

00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:13.493
So that ranges from heart disease,
to malaria, HIV, AIDS,

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:15.794
as well as other forms
of cancer -- anything.

00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:18.409
And so, hopefully one day,

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.845
we can all have that one extra uncle,

00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:24.103
that one mother, that one brother, sister,

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:26.366
we can have that one more
family member to love.

00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:31.785
And that our hearts will be rid
of that one disease burden

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:34.735
that comes from pancreatic,
ovarian and lung cancer,

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.835
and potentially any disease.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:39.660
But through the Internet,
anything is possible.

00:09:39.684 --> 00:09:40.964
Theories can be shared,

00:09:40.988 --> 00:09:43.715
and you don't have to be
a professor with multiple degrees

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:45.245
to have your ideas valued.

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:49.310
It's a neutral space, where
what you look like, age or gender --

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:50.490
it doesn't matter.

00:09:50.594 --> 00:09:52.424
It's just your ideas that count.

00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:57.815
For me, it's all about looking
at the Internet in an entirely new way,

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.935
to realize that there's so much more to it

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:02.829
than just posting duck-face
pictures of yourself online.

00:10:03.464 --> 00:10:04.614
(Laughter)

00:10:05.277 --> 00:10:06.939
You could be changing the world.

00:10:08.202 --> 00:10:13.464
So if a 15 year-old who didn't even know
what a pancreas was

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.229
could find a new way
to detect pancreatic cancer --

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.149
just imagine what you could do.

00:10:19.376 --> 00:10:20.614
Thank you.

00:10:20.638 --> 00:10:27.337
(Applause)
