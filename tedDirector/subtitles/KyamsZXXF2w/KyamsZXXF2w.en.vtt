00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I love video games.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I'm also slightly in awe of them.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I'm in awe of their power

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in terms of concept.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
But I think, above all,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I'm in awe at their power

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
to motivate, to compel us,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to transfix us,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
like really nothing else we've ever invented

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
has quite done before.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
by looking at how we do this.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And in particular, I think we can learn things

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
about learning.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Now the video games industry

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
is far and away the fastest growing

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
of all modern media.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
From about 10 billion in 1990,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and it shows no sign of slowing down.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
In four years' time,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
That's about three times the recorded music industry.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
This is pretty stunning,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
The thing that really amazes me

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
is that, today,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
people spend about

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
eight billion real dollars a year

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
buying virtual items

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that only exist

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
inside video games.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Earlier this year,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
a virtual asteroid in it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
sold for 330,000 real dollars.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And this

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is a Titan class ship

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in the space game, EVE Online.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And this virtual object

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
takes 200 real people

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
about 56 days of real time to build,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
plus countless thousands of hours

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
of effort before that.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And yet, many of these get built.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
At the other end of the scale,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
has 70 million players

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
around the world

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and most of these players

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
are playing it almost every day.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
This may all sound

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
really quite alarming to some people,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
an index of something worrying

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
or wrong in society.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But we're here for the good news,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and the good news is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that I think we can explore

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
why this very real human effort,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
this very intense generation of value, is occurring.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And by answering that question,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I think we can take something

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
extremely powerful away.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And I think the most interesting way

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
to think about how all this is going on

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
is in terms of rewards.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And specifically, it's in terms

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
of the very intense emotional rewards

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that playing games offers to people

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
both individually

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and collectively.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
when they are being engaged,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
two quite different processes are occurring.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
On the other hand, there's the liking processes,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
fun and affection

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and delight

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And this kind of a world,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
this vast flying beast you can ride around,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
shows why games are so very good

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
at doing both the wanting and the liking.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
It gives you great powers.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And so these combine to form

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
a very intense emotional engagement.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
The really interesting stuff about virtuality

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is what you can measure with it.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Because what you can measure in virtuality

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
is everything.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Every single thing that every single person

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
The biggest games in the world today

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
are measuring more than one billion points of data

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
about their players, about what everybody does --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And this allows something very special

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to happen in games.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
It's something called the reward schedule.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And by this, I mean looking

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
at what millions upon millions of people have done

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
and carefully calibrating the rate,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
to keep them engaged

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
over staggering amounts of time and effort.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Now, to try and explain this

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
in sort of real terms,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
I want to talk about a kind of task

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that might fall to you in so many games.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Let's say, for the sake of argument,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
my mission is to get 15 pies

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and I can get 15 pies

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
by killing these cute, little monsters.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Simple game quest.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Now you can think about this, if you like,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
as a problem about boxes.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I've got to keep opening boxes.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
I don't know what's inside them until I open them.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
you can think about it, if you like,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
as a great box-opening effort.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
getting better and better stuff in them.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
This sounds immensely boring

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
but games are able

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
to make this process

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
incredibly compelling.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And the way they do this

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
is through a combination of probability and data.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Let's think about probability.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
If we want to engage someone

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
we want to make sure it's neither too easy,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
nor too difficult, to find a pie.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and you work out, if you make the pie rate

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
about 25 percent --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
It keeps people engaged.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
where all you had to do was get a million pies

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
or a thousand pies.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
That would be very boring.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
You find that -- you know, between five and 20

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
is about the right number for keeping people going.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
But we don't just have pies in the boxes.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
There's 100 percent up here.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
there's something in it, some little reward

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that keeps people progressing and engaged.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
In most adventure games,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
But we don't just do that either.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
We also say there's going to be loads of other items

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
of varying qualities and levels of excitement.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
you get an absolutely awesome item.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And also, we say,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So all this is very powerful.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So we can do

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
some rather amazing things.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
They're not rational about probability.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
They think this game is unfair.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
adjust the world to match their expectation.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
Our games don't always do this.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And one thing they certainly do at the moment

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
to keep the value, to keep it special.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And the point is really

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
that we evolved to be satisfied by the world

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
in particular ways.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
we evolved to find certain things stimulating,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and as very intelligent, civilized beings,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
But now, we can reverse engineer that

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and build worlds

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
So what does all this mean in practice?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Well, I've come up

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
with seven things

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
that, I think, show

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
how you can take these lessons from games

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and use them outside of games.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
The first one is very simple:

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
experience bars measuring progress --

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
something that's been talked about brilliantly

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
in little bits and pieces,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
you give them one profile character avatar

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
which is constantly progressing

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And everything comes towards that,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Second, multiple long and short-term aims --

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
5,000 pies, boring,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
15 pies, interesting.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So, you give people

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
lots and lots of different tasks.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
You say, it's about

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
doing 10 of these questions,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
but another task

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
is turning up to 20 classes on time,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
but another task is collaborating with other people,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
another task is showing you're working five times,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
another task is hitting this particular target.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
You break things down into these calibrated slices

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
that people can choose and do in parallel

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
to keep them engaged

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and that you can use to point them

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
towards individually beneficial activities.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Third, you reward effort.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Fourth, feedback.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
This is absolutely crucial,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that we've been hearing amazing things about,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
it's very, very hard for people to learn

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
if they cannot link consequences to actions.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Pollution, global warming, these things --

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
the consequences are distant in time and space.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
But if you can model things for people,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
if you can give things to people that they can manipulate

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and play with and where the feedback comes,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
then they can learn a lesson, they can see,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
they can move on, they can understand.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And fifth,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
the element of uncertainty.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Now this is the neurological goldmine,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
if you like,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
because a known reward

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
excites people,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
but what really gets them going

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
is the uncertain reward,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And if you think about

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
using this in testing,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
in just introducing control elements of randomness

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
in all forms of testing and training,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
you can transform the levels of people's engagement

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
by tapping into this very powerful

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
evolutionary mechanism.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
When we don't quite predict something perfectly,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
we get really excited about it.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
We just want to go back and find out more.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
As you probably know, the neurotransmitter

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
associated with learning is called dopamine.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
dopamine levels in the brain.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And what this means is we can predict learning,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
we can predict enhanced engagement,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
these windows, these windows of time,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
And two things really flow from this.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
The first has to do with memory,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that we can find these moments.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
When someone is more likely to remember,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
we can give them a nugget in a window.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
And the second thing is confidence,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that we can see how game-playing and reward structures

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
make people braver, make them more willing to take risks,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
more willing to take on difficulty,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
harder to discourage.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
This can all seem very sinister.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
The word "addiction" is thrown around.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
There are real concerns there.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
is other people.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
This is what really excites us.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
In reward terms, it's not money;

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
it's not being given cash -- that's nice --

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
it's doing stuff with our peers,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
watching us, collaborating with us.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
a video game called EverQuest.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And in this video game,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
That's a problem

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
because they dropped two or three decent items.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
So players addressed this problem

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
by spontaneously coming up with a system

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
to motivate each other,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
fairly and transparently.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
they called "dragon kill points."

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And every time you turned up to go on a mission,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
you got paid in dragon kill points.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
They tracked these on a separate website.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
So they tracked their own private currency,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and then players could bid afterwards

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
for cool items they wanted --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
all organized by the players themselves.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
but that today, a decade on,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
every single video game in the world with this kind of task

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
uses a version of this system --

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
tens of millions of people.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And the success rate

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
is at close to 100 percent.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
This is a player-developed,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
self-enforcing, voluntary currency,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and it's incredibly sophisticated

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
player behavior.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And I just want to end by suggesting

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
a few ways in which these principles

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
could fan out into the world.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Let's start with business.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
around something like business are

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
recycling and energy conservation.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
like real-time energy meters.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And I just look at this, and I think, yes,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
we could take that so much further

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
by allowing people to set targets

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
by setting calibrated targets,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
by using elements of uncertainty,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
by using these multiple targets,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
by setting people up

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
to collaborate and compete,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
to use these very sophisticated

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
group and motivational mechanics we see.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
In terms of education,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
perhaps most obviously of all,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
we can transform how we engage people.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
We can offer people the grand continuity

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
of experience and personal investment.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
We can break things down

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
into highly calibrated small tasks.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
We can use calculated randomness.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
We can reward effort consistently

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
as everything fields together.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And we can use the kind of group behaviors

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
that we see evolving when people are at play together,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
these really quite unprecedentedly complex

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
cooperative mechanisms.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
is the U.S. government, among others,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
is literally starting to pay people

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
to lose weight.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So we're seeing financial reward being used

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
to tackle the great issue of obesity.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
But again, those rewards

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
could be calibrated so precisely

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
if we were able to use the vast expertise

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
to take the data, to take the observations,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
of millions of human hours

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and plow that feedback

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
into increasing engagement.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
that I want to leave you with.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
It's about how individual engagement

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
can be transformed

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
by the psychological and the neurological lessons

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
we can learn from watching people that are playing games.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
But it's also about collective engagement

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and about the unprecedented laboratory

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
for observing what makes people tick

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and work and play and engage

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
on a grand scale in games.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And if we can look at these things and learn from them

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and see how to turn them outwards,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
Thank you very much.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
(Applause)
