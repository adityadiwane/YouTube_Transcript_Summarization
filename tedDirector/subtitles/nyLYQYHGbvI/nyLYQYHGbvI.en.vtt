00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
and it was a really cool device.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.330
You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And I was fascinated.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.330
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
the arithmetic and logic unit.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
just to keep all this data moving through the system.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
But nobody was really worried about this.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
When computers were first introduced,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
they were said to be a million times faster than neurons.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
the capacity of the brain.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
as to ask a person."

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.330
This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.330
What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
is that we pay a huge price for the speed

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
that we claim is a big advantage of these computers.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Let's take a look at some numbers.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.330
It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
10 quadrillion bits of information per second.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.330
That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
So that would be really great, if you could add that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
to the production capacity in Tanzania.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
It would really boost the economy.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Just to go back to the States,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
if you translate the amount of power or electricity

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
this computer uses to the amount of households in the States,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
you get 1,200 households in the U.S.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
That's how much power this computer uses.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
Now, let's compare this with the brain.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.330
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
(Laughter)

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
So that's true love, right there.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Now, how much computation does the brain do?

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
So that's the question. The question is, how much --

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer:

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
it's just 10 watts.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
So what we are doing right now with computers

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.330
the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
And let me just summarize. So the bottom line:

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
than we do right now with this computer technology that we have.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
How is the brain able to do this?

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
Let's just take a look about how the brain works,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and then I'll compare that with how computers work.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
It shows you these cells that process information.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.330
They are called neurons.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.330
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.330
and where they contact each other, those little pulses

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
That process is called a synapse.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
about 100 million of them,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.330
sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
How does that compare with the way computers work?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
In the computer, you have all the data

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
going through the central processing unit,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and the data just really flows through a network of connections

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
The net is doing the work in the brain.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
If you just look at these two pictures,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
these kind of words pop into your mind.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.330
This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
everything has to happen in lockstep --

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
whereas this is parallel and it's fluid.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.330
"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.330
(Laughter)

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
Brian actually said this in 1995.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And nobody was listening then,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
but now people are beginning to listen

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.330
because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.330
This is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.330
between the devices that we use to compute in computers,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.330
and the devices that our brains use to compute.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.330
This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
from the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
And that current, electrical current,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.330
is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.330
And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.330
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.330
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.330
and the absence of current to represent a zero.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
they no longer behave like this.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.330
In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
which is called an ion channel.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
And this is a little protein molecule.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.330
I mean, neurons have thousands of these.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
And these are individual potassium ions

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
that are flowing through that pore.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
Now, this pore can open and close.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.330
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
it's a sporadic flow of current.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.330
they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
even when it's closed, because these ions are so small,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
So, what you have is that when the pore is open,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
you get some current sometimes.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.330
And when it's closed, you have a zero,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
but you have a few ones thrown in.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
Now, this is starting to happen in transistors.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.330
And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.330
that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.330
In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
And that means that a transistor corresponds

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
to about 12 ion channels in parallel.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.330
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.330
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
of stuff on them -- before, it was 256.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
and technology has really benefitted from that.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.330
But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
that it corresponds to only one electron at a time

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
can flow through that channel,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
and that corresponds to a single ion channel.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
The current will turn on and off at random,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
even when it's supposed to be on.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
And that means your computer is going to get

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.330
its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.330
So, we are at the stage where we

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.330
OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
it sends it into the processor or the ALU,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
and then it puts the result back into memory.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
That's the red path that's highlighted.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And the way they represent information is

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
they break up that data into little pieces

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
that are represented by pulses and different neurons.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
So you have all these pieces of data

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
distributed throughout the network.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And then the way that you process that data to get a result

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.330
is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
just by it flowing through the network.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
So you set up these connections

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
such that the input pattern just flows

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
and generates the output pattern.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.330
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.330
it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
with these redundant connections.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
So even when you go to these crappy devices

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
there's redundancy in the network

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
that can actually recover the missing information.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
It makes the brain inherently robust.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.330
And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.330
that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.330
What I want to basically talk about is my dream,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330
which is to build a computer that works like the brain.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
And I'm going to show you a system that we designed

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
to model the retina,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.330
which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.330
We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
In fact, the processing that happens

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
in that little piece of brain is very similar

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.330
to the kind of processing that computers

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
do when they stream video over the Internet.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.330
They want to compress the information --

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.330
they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and that is how your eyeball

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
to send to the rest of the brain.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
we went and talked to neurobiologists

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
And they figured out all the different cells,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
and they figured out the network, and we just took that network

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:56.330
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
And these transistors are behaving essentially

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
just like ion channels behave in the brain.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.330
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.330
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
that the silicon retina put out of its output

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
who's the student who designed this chip.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
because it's putting out different kinds of information,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
it's not as straightforward as a camera.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
It extracts regions with dark contrast,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
which will show up on the video as red.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
which will show up on the video as green.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
This is Kareem's dark eyes

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
and that's the white background that you see here.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And then it also extracts movement.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
When Kareem moves his head to the right,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
you will see this blue activity there;

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
that's where it's going from dark to light.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
And you also see this yellow activity,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
which represents regions where contrast is decreasing;

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
it's going from light to dark.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
And these four types of information --

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.330
your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
and 900,000 of those fibers

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
send these four types of information.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.330
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
What you notice here is that these snapshots

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.330
taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.330
And this is the same thing you see

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
So this image here is going to look like these ones,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.330
so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
And so, here you go.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
Yes, so that's the idea.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
But when it's moving back and forth,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
the retina picks up these changes.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.330
And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
and something happens in your background,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
you merely move your eyes to it.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
There are these cells that detect change

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.330
and you move your attention to it.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
So those are very important for catching somebody

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
who's trying to sneak up on you.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
when you put Africa in a piano, OK.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
This is a steel drum here that has been modified,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.330
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
and come up with a new kind of computer

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
Thank you.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
(Applause)

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
the future of Africa, this conference --

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
what connections can we make, if any, between them?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.330
I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.330
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
It was very brute force; it was very inelegant.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
I don't think that I would've had that reaction,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.330
buying into this hype about computers.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
I was coming at it from a different perspective,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
where I was bringing that different perspective

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
to bear on the problem.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
and I think that's going to impact technology.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.330
And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
to come up with new things,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
because you're coming from a different perspective.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.330
I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.330
Thank you.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
(Applause)
