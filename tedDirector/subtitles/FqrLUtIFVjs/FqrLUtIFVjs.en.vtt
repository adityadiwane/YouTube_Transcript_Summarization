00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:17.049
Cybercrime is out of control.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:19.371
It's everywhere.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.683
We hear about it every single day.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.805
This year,

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.963
over two billion records lost or stolen.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.505
And last year, 100 million of us,
mostly Americans,

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:42.663
lost our health insurance data
to thieves -- myself included.

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:49.571
What's particularly concerning about this
is that in most cases,

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:55.506
it was months before anyone even
reported that these records were stolen.

00:00:56.984 --> 00:01:00.027
So if you watch the evening news,

00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:05.257
you would think that most of this
is espionage or nation-state activity.

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:07.906
And, well, some of it is.

00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:12.952
Espionage, you see, is an accepted
international practice.

00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:15.096
But in this case,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.573
it is only a small portion
of the problem that we're dealing with.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.794
How often do we hear about a breach

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:29.669
followed by, "... it was the result
of a sophisticated nation-state attack?"

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:35.342
Well, often that is companies
not being willing to own up

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.346
to their own lackluster
security practices.

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:41.385
There is also a widely held belief

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:46.026
that by blaming an attack
on a nation-state,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.731
you are putting regulators at bay --

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.789
at least for a period of time.

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:56.140
So where is all of this coming from?

00:01:56.817 --> 00:02:02.310
The United Nations estimates
that 80 percent of it

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:08.104
is from highly organized
and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.

00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:10.793
To date,

00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:17.417
this represents one of the largest
illegal economies in the world,

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.561
topping out at, now get this,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.901
445 billion dollars.

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.271
Let me put that in perspective
for all of you:

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:34.399
445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP

00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:37.089
of 160 nations,

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:41.658
including Ireland, Finland,
Denmark and Portugal,

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:42.912
to name a few.

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.117
So how does this work?

00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.047
How do these criminals operate?

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:51.377
Well, let me tell you a little story.

00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.545
About a year ago,

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.879
our security researchers were tracking

00:02:56.903 --> 00:03:02.949
a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated
banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:05.966
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.990
via you clicking on a link
in a phishing email

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:10.966
that you probably shouldn't have.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.987
It would then sit and wait.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.586
It would wait until you logged
into your bank account.

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.462
And when you did,
the bad guys would reach in,

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:22.139
steal your credentials,

00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:24.064
and then use that to steal your money.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.763
This sounds terrible,

00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:29.580
but the reality is,
in the security industry,

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:33.286
this form of attack
is somewhat commonplace.

00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:41.986
However, the Dyre Wolf had
two distinctly different personalities --

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.820
one for these small transactions,

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:47.884
but it took on an entirely
different persona

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:51.723
if you were in the business of moving
large-scale wire transfers.

00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:53.446
Here's what would happen.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.270
You start the process
of issuing a wire transfer,

00:03:56.294 --> 00:03:59.302
and up in your browser would pop
a screen from your bank,

00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:01.923
indicating that there's a problem
with your account,

00:04:01.947 --> 00:04:05.138
and that you need to call
the bank immediately,

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.904
along with the number
to the bank's fraud department.

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:10.825
So you pick up the phone and you call.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.860
And after going through
the normal voice prompts,

00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:16.001
you're met with
an English-speaking operator.

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:18.893
"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.
How can I help you?"

00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:23.506
And you go through the process
like you do every time you call your bank,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.321
of giving them your name
and your account number,

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:30.268
going through the security checks
to verify you are who you said you are.

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.117
Most of us may not know this,

00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:35.370
but in many large-scale wire transfers,

00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:38.505
it requires two people to sign off
on the wire transfer,

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.728
so the operator then asks you
to get the second person on the line,

00:04:41.752 --> 00:04:44.553
and goes through the same set
of verifications and checks.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.126
Sounds normal, right?

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.171
Only one problem:

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.020
you're not talking to the bank.

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:52.630
You're talking to the criminals.

00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:54.852
They had built
an English-speaking help desk,

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:56.941
fake overlays to the banking website.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:05:00.065
And this was so flawlessly executed

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.232
that they were moving
between a half a million

00:05:02.256 --> 00:05:05.343
and a million and a half
dollars per attempt

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.925
into their criminal coffers.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.575
These criminal organizations operate

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.624
like highly regimented,
legitimate businesses.

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:16.648
Their employees work
Monday through Friday.

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.665
They take the weekends off.

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.072
How do we know this?

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:23.229
We know this because
our security researchers see

00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:26.319
repeated spikes of malware
on a Friday afternoon.

00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:30.289
The bad guys, after a long weekend
with the wife and kids,

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:32.553
come back in to see how well things went.

00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:38.195
The Dark Web is where
they spend their time.

00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:44.904
That is a term used to describe
the anonymous underbelly of the internet,

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.853
where thieves can operate with anonymity

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:49.322
and without detection.

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.056
Here they peddle their attack software

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.536
and share information
on new attack techniques.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:59.241
You can buy everything there,

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:02.921
from a base-level attack
to a much more advanced version.

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.954
In fact, in many cases, you even see

00:06:05.978 --> 00:06:09.150
gold, silver and bronze levels of service.

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:11.394
You can check references.

00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:14.357
You can even buy attacks

00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:17.709
that come with a money-back guarantee --

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:18.778
(Laughter)

00:06:18.802 --> 00:06:20.457
if you're not successful.

00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:24.842
Now, these environments,
these marketplaces --

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:28.213
they look like an Amazon or an eBay.

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:32.193
You see products, prices,
ratings and reviews.

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:34.471
Of course, if you're going
to buy an attack,

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.944
you're going to buy from a reputable
criminal with good ratings, right?

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:38.972
(Laughter)

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.197
This isn't any different

00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:45.411
than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor
before going to a new restaurant.

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:48.416
So, here is an example.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.861
This is an actual screenshot
of a vendor selling malware.

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:55.700
Notice they're a vendor level four,

00:06:55.724 --> 00:06:57.565
they have a trust level of six.

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.924
They've had 400 positive reviews
in the last year,

00:06:59.948 --> 00:07:02.328
and only two negative reviews
in the last month.

00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:06.249
We even see things like licensing terms.

00:07:06.582 --> 00:07:08.586
Here's an example of a site you can go to

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.367
if you want to change your identity.

00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.248
They will sell you a fake ID,

00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:13.866
fake passports.

00:07:14.423 --> 00:07:19.472
But note the legally binding terms
for purchasing your fake ID.

00:07:20.338 --> 00:07:21.859
Give me a break.

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:24.741
What are they going to do --
sue you if you violate them?

00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:25.915
(Laughter)

00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:29.701
This occurred a couple of months ago.

00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:33.340
One of our security
researchers was looking

00:07:33.364 --> 00:07:38.362
at a new Android malware application
that we had discovered.

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.306
It was called Bilal Bot.

00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:43.260
In a blog post,

00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:50.089
she positioned Bilal Bot
as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.028
to the much more advanced GM Bot

00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:56.867
that was commonplace
in the criminal underground.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.488
This review did not sit well
with the authors of Bilal Bot.

00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:05.637
So they wrote her this very email,

00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:09.605
pleading their case
and making the argument

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:15.058
that they felt she had evaluated
an older version.

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:20.727
They asked her to please update
her blog with more accurate information

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.163
and even offered to do an interview

00:08:24.187 --> 00:08:26.408
to describe to her in detail

00:08:26.432 --> 00:08:31.031
how their attack software was now
far better than the competition.

00:08:32.185 --> 00:08:33.510
So look,

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:37.398
you don't have to like what they do,

00:08:37.422 --> 00:08:42.341
but you do have to respect
the entrepreneurial nature

00:08:42.365 --> 00:08:43.572
of their endeavors.

00:08:43.596 --> 00:08:44.746
(Laughter)

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:50.151
So how are we going to stop this?

00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:57.098
It's not like we're going to be able
to identify who's responsible --

00:08:57.122 --> 00:09:00.084
remember, they operate with anonymity

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:02.093
and outside the reach of the law.

00:09:03.037 --> 00:09:06.321
We're certainly not going to be able
to prosecute the offenders.

00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:12.521
I would propose that we need
a completely new approach.

00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:17.489
And that approach needs
to be centered on the idea

00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:21.408
that we need to change
the economics for the bad guys.

00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:25.166
And to give you a perspective
on how this can work,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.178
let's think of the response we see
to a healthcare pandemic:

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:33.205
SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:35.777
What is the top priority?

00:09:35.801 --> 00:09:41.094
It's knowing who is infected
and how the disease is spreading.

00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:49.982
Now, governments, private institutions,
hospitals, physicians --

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:54.601
everyone responds openly and quickly.

00:09:55.154 --> 00:09:59.125
This is a collective and altruistic effort

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:03.049
to stop the spread in its tracks

00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:05.950
and to inform anyone not infected

00:10:05.974 --> 00:10:08.354
how to protect or inoculate themselves.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.414
Unfortunately, this is not at all
what we see in response to a cyber attack.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.121
Organizations are far more likely
to keep information on that attack

00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:23.770
to themselves.

00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:26.058
Why?

00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:29.052
Because they're worried
about competitive advantage,

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.434
litigation

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.764
or regulation.

00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:39.417
We need to effectively democratize
threat intelligence data.

00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:45.271
We need to get all of these organizations
to open up and share

00:10:45.295 --> 00:10:48.917
what is in their private arsenal
of information.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.624
The bad guys are moving fast;

00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:55.765
we've got to move faster.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.292
And the best way to do that is to open up

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:02.663
and share data on what's happening.

00:11:03.124 --> 00:11:07.450
Let's think about this in the construct
of security professionals.

00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:12.960
Remember, they're programmed right
into their DNA to keep secrets.

00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:16.008
We've got to turn
that thinking on its head.

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:19.313
We've got to get governments,
private institutions

00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:20.780
and security companies

00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:23.535
willing to share information at speed.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:25.235
And here's why:

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:27.136
because if you share the information,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.177
it's equivalent to inoculation.

00:11:30.483 --> 00:11:32.030
And if you're not sharing,

00:11:32.054 --> 00:11:34.155
you're actually part of the problem,

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:39.947
because you're increasing the odds
that other people could be impacted

00:11:39.971 --> 00:11:42.601
by the same attack techniques.

00:11:43.806 --> 00:11:45.855
But there's an even bigger benefit.

00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:51.764
By destroying criminals' devices
closer to real time,

00:11:51.788 --> 00:11:53.541
we break their plans.

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:58.522
We inform the people they aim to hurt

00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:01.191
far sooner than they had ever anticipated.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.541
We ruin their reputations,

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:07.657
we crush their ratings and reviews.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:11.957
We make cybercrime not pay.

00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:16.519
We change the economics for the bad guys.

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:22.107
But to do this,
a first mover was required --

00:12:22.131 --> 00:12:26.732
someone to change the thinking
in the security industry overall.

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:29.157
About a year ago,

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.687
my colleagues and I had a radical idea.

00:12:32.444 --> 00:12:37.028
What if IBM were to take our data --

00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:41.795
we had one of the largest threat
intelligence databases in the world --

00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:43.178
and open it up?

00:12:43.577 --> 00:12:47.038
It had information not just
on what had happened in the past,

00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:49.537
but what was happening in near-real time.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.458
What if we were to publish it all
openly on the internet?

00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:56.777
As you can imagine,
this got quite a reaction.

00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:58.165
First came the lawyers:

00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.504
What are the legal
implications of doing that?

00:13:01.205 --> 00:13:02.540
Then came the business:

00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.964
What are the business
implications of doing that?

00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:07.615
And this was also met with a good dose

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.747
of a lot of people just asking
if we were completely crazy.

00:13:11.748 --> 00:13:15.534
But there was one conversation
that kept floating to the surface

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:17.609
in every dialogue that we would have:

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.767
the realization that if we didn't do this,

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:24.422
then we were part of the problem.

00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:28.194
So we did something unheard of
in the security industry.

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:30.538
We started publishing.

00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:34.972
Over 700 terabytes of actionable
threat intelligence data,

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:38.001
including information on real-time attacks

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:40.888
that can be used to stop
cybercrime in its tracks.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:43.003
And to date,

00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:47.071
over 4,000 organizations
are leveraging this data,

00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:48.974
including half of the Fortune 100.

00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:54.436
And our hope as a next step
is to get all of those organizations

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.421
to join us in the fight,

00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:57.996
and do the same thing

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.108
and share their information

00:14:00.132 --> 00:14:02.666
on when and how
they're being attacked as well.

00:14:03.372 --> 00:14:06.390
We all have the opportunity to stop it,

00:14:06.414 --> 00:14:08.575
and we already all know how.

00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:13.562
All we have to do is look
to the response that we see

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.092
in the world of health care,

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:17.019
and how they respond to a pandemic.

00:14:17.443 --> 00:14:18.822
Simply put,

00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:21.122
we need to be open and collaborative.

00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:22.847
Thank you.

00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:26.663
(Applause)
