00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Thank you.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.160
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
It was a simple machine that changed my life.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Before that time,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
I had never been away from my home

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
in Malawi.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
I had never used a computer.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
I had never seen an Internet.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
My English lost,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
I wanted to vomit.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
(Laughter)

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
white people.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
(Laughter)

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
But well, I'm feeling good right now.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
I would like to share that story today.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
We have seven children in my family.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
All sisters, excepting me.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Before I discovered the wonders of science,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
I was just a simple farmer

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
in a country of poor farmers.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Like everyone else, we grew maize.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.160
One year our fortune turned very bad.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.160
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.160
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
My family ate one meal per day, at night.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
The food passes through our bodies.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
We drop down to nothing.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
In Malawi, the secondary school,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
you have to pay school fees.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I looked at my father

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
and looked at those dry fields.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
It was the future I couldn't accept.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
so I was determined to do anything possible

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
to receive education.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
So I went to a library.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
I read books, science books, especially physics.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
I couldn't read English that well.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
I used diagrams and pictures

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
to learn the words around them.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
Another book put that knowledge in my hands.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.160
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
Pump water meant irrigation,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
a defense against hunger,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
which we were experiencing by that time.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
But I didn't have materials to use,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
so I went to a scrap yard

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
where I found my materials.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Many people, including my mother,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
said I was crazy.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
(Laughter)

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
I found a tractor fan,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
shock absorber, PVC pipes.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Using a bicycle frame

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
and an old bicycle dynamo,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
I built my machine.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
It was one light at first.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And then four lights,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.160
with switches, and even a circuit breaker,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
modeled after an electric bell.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Another machine pumps water

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
for irrigation.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Queues of people start lining up at my house

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
(Laughter)

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
to charge their mobile phone.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
(Applause)

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
I could not get rid of them.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
(Laughter)

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And the reporters came too,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
which lead to bloggers

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.160
and which lead to a call from something called TED.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
I had never seen an airplane before.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
I had never slept in a hotel.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160
So, on stage that day in Arusha,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
my English lost,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
I said something like,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.160
"I tried. And I made it."

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
So I would like to say something

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
to all the people out there like me

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
to the Africans, and the poor

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
who are struggling with your dreams.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
God bless.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
Whatever happens, don't give up.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
Thank you.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:50.160
(Applause)
