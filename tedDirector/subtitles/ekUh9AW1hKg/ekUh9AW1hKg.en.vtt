00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.834
Even nature's most disgusting creatures

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.401
have important secrets,

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.890
but who would want a swarm of cockroaches

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.484
coming towards them?

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:24.496
Yet one of the greatest differences
between natural and human technologies

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.711
relates to robustness.

00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.284
Robust systems are stable in complex

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:31.005
and new environments.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.800
Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.479
running over rough terrain.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:35.741
When we put a jet pack on them,

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:37.752
or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:40.643
we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs

00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:42.268
allow them to self-stabilize

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:45.930
without using any of their brainpower.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.060
They can go over complex terrain like grass,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.012
no problem, and not get destabilized.

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.526
We discovered a new behavior where,

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:53.690
because of their shape,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.768
they actually roll automatically to their side

00:00:55.768 --> 00:00:59.720
to go through this artificial test bit of grass.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.157
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:04.295
with the same structure.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.162
Here's a new behavior we've discovered.

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:08.008
The animals rapidly invert and disappear

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.509
in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.872
using the same structures that
they use to run, their legs.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.476
They can run upside down

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:17.608
very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,

00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.087
and if you perturb one of those branches,

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:20.880
they can do this.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.410
They can perform gymnastic maneuvers

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.988
like no robot we have yet.

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:26.719
And they have nearly unlimited

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.316
maneuverability with that same structure

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:33.136
and unprecedented access to a variety

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:37.406
of different areas.

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:40.029
They have wings for flying when they get warm,

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:42.643
but they use those same wings to flip over

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:46.600
if they get destabilized.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.897
Very effective.

00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:51.102
Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:52.242
This is the foot of a cockroach.

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:55.531
It has spines, gluey pads and claws,

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:57.122
but if you take off those feet,

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:58.830
they can still go over rough terrain,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.727
like the bottom video that you see,

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:04.098
without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:07.271
They can run up mesh without their feet.

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.554
Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:

00:02:09.554 --> 00:02:11.097
three legs, three legs, three legs,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.789
but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.799
Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.715
It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:25.642
and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.

00:02:25.642 --> 00:02:27.600
And I point out that all of these videos

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.304
are slowed down 20 times,

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:31.319
so they're actually really fast, when you see this.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.830
Robust systems are also damage resistant.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.643
Here's an animal climbing up a wall.

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:39.139
It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.378
but when you slow it down,

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:42.872
you see something very different.

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.520
Here's what they do.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.527
They intentionally have a
head-on collision with the wall

00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:49.641
so they don't slow down and can transition up it

00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.039
in 75 milliseconds.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.900
And they can do this in part because they have

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.957
extraordinary exoskeletons.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:59.766
And they're really just made up of compliant joints

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:01.499
that are tubes and plates

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.042
connected to one another.

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:05.989
Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.950
You see these plates, and you
see the compliant membrane.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.766
My engineering colleague at Berkeley

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:13.890
designed with his students

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.371
a novel manufacturing technique

00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.982
where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:20.342
you laser cut it, laminate it,

00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:22.737
and you fold it up into a robot.

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:28.554
And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.493
These robots, called DASH,

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:33.103
for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,

00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:36.185
are highly compliant robots,

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.887
and they're remarkably robust as a result

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:41.690
of these features.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.748
They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:51.101
(Laughter)

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.570
They even have some of the
behaviors of the cockroaches.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.843
So they can use their smart, compliant body

00:03:55.843 --> 00:03:58.360
to transition up a wall

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.252
in a very simple way.

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:02.880
They even have some of the beginnings

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.199
of the rapid inversion behavior

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.043
where they disappear.

00:04:07.043 --> 00:04:08.520
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.089
We discovered that they can go through

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.877
three-millimeter gaps,

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:14.238
the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,

00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:15.286
and when they do this,

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:17.861
they can actually run through those confined spaces

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.618
at high speeds,

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:22.800
although you never see it.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.862
To understand it better,

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:25.940
we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.414
and showed that they can compress their body

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:30.060
by over 40 percent.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.617
We put them in a materials testing machine

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:33.973
to look at the stress strain analysis

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.091
and showed that they can withstand forces

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.995
800 times their body weight,

00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:39.885
and after this they can fly and run

00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:41.875
absolutely normally.

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.598
So you never know where

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:46.672
curiosity-based research will lead,

00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:48.211
and someday you may want a swarm

00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:50.405
of cockroach-inspired robots

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.819
to come at you.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:59.940
(Laughter)

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.497
Thank you.

00:05:01.497 --> 00:05:02.783
(Applause)
