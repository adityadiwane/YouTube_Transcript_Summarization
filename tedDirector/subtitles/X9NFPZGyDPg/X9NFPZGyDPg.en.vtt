00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
No, I'm just joking.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It's interesting, because it was six years ago

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
when I was pregnant with my first child

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that I discovered

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that the most commonly used preservative

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
in baby care products

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
mimics estrogen

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
when it gets into the human body.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Now it's very easy actually

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
to get a chemical compound from products

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
into the human body through the skin.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And these preservatives had been found

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in breast cancer tumors.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
That was the start of my journey

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
to make this film, "Toxic Baby."

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And it doesn't take much time

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
to discover some really astonishing statistics

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
with this issue.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
One is that you and I all have

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
between 30 to 50,000 chemicals

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in our bodies

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
that our grandparents didn't have.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And many of these chemicals

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
of chronic childhood disease

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that we're seeing across industrialized nations.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I'll show you some statistics.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So for example, in the United Kingdom,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
the incidence of childhood leukemia

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
That's a four-fold increase.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Again, similar story around the world.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
In the United States,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
probably the most astonishing statistic

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
is a 600 percent increase

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
in autism and autistic spectrum disorders

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and other learning disabilities.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Again, we're seeing that trend

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
across Europe, across North America.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And in Europe,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
there's certain parts of Europe,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
where we're seeing a four-fold increase

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in certain genital birth defects.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Interestingly, one of those birth defects

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So a real skyrocketing

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
of chronic childhood disease

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that includes other things

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
like obesity and juvenile diabetes,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
premature puberty.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
So it's interesting for me,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and talk to an audience about these things,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that probably one of the most important people in the world

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
who can discuss toxicity in babies

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is expert in frogs.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
(Laughter)

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
that I would be talking about pesticides,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
that I'd be talking about public health,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
(Laughter)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Frogs.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
was sort of a surprise as well

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and they asked me if I would evaluate

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
for the largest chemical company in the world.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
It's the number one contaminant

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
but in that same year,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
We were a bit surprised when we found out

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that when we exposed frogs

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that it produced animals that look like this.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
These are the dissected gonads of an animal

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that has two testes, two ovaries,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
another large testis, more ovaries,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
which is not normal ...

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
(Laughter)

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
even for amphibians.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
bursting through the surface of this male's testes.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
would probably be somewhere in the top five.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
(Laughter)

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
In recent studies that we've published,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
some of the males grow up

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and completely become females.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
even though they're genetic males.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
What we proposed,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and what we've now generated support for,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
is that what atrazine is doing

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Normally the testes should make testosterone,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
the male hormone.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
the machinery if you will, aromatase,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that converts testosterone into estrogen.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And as a result, these exposed males

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and they're subsequently feminized

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
because now they're making the female hormone.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Because it turns out

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.260
aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and that estrogen turns on or promotes

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the growth of that cancer

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
that the latest treatment for breast cancer

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
is a chemical called letrozole,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Now what's interesting is, of course,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
turns on aromatase, increases estrogen

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and promotes tumors in rats

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
What's interesting is, in fact,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
the breast cancer promoter,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And so I find it interesting

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
that instead of treating this disease

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
we simply respond

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
by putting more chemicals into the environment.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
PJC: So speaking of estrogen,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
is something called bisphenol A, BPA,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
which has been in the news recently.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
It's a plasticizer.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
which is what baby bottles are made out of.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And what's interesting about BPA

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
is that it's such a potent estrogen

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
that it was actually once considered for use

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that BPA leaches from babies' bottles

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
into the formula, into the milk,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and therefore into the babies.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So we're dosing our babies,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
our newborns, our infants,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
with a synthetic estrogen.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Now two weeks ago or so,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
the European Union passed a law

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
banning the use of BPA

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And for those of you who are not parents,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
sippy cups are those little plastic things

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
that your child graduates to after using bottles.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
But just two weeks before that,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
the U.S. Senate refused to even debate

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
the banning of BPA

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
So it really makes you realize

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
the onus on parents

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
to have to look at this and regulate this and police this

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
in their own lives

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and how astonishing that is.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
it really shows how sometimes

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
it is only a parent's awareness

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that stands between chemicals and our children.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
The baby bottle scenario proves

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
However, if we parents are unaware,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
we are leaving our children

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
to fend for themselves.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
TH: And what Penelope says here

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
is even more true.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Scientists agree now.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
We are losing species from the Earth

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and leading that loss are amphibians.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
80 percent of all amphibians

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
are threatened and in come decline.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And I believe, many scientists believe

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that pesticides are an important part of that decline.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
no eggshells, no membranes

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and no placenta.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
one of our big inventions was the placenta.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
But it turns out that this ancient structure

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
that separates us from other animals, the placenta,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
cannot evolve or adapt fast enough

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
that it's never seen before.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Of those rats that don't abort,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
atrazine causes prostate disease

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
in the pups so the sons

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
are born with an old man's disease.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Of those that don't abort,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
in the exposed daughters in utero,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
so that their breast don't develop properly.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And as a result, when those rats grow up,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
their pups experience retarded growth and development

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
that its grandmother was exposed to.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And given the life of many of these chemicals,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
generations, years, dozens of years,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
that means that we right now

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
are affecting the health

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
by things that we're putting into the environment today.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
PCBs, DDT

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
cross the placenta

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and effectively determine

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
the likelihood of developing breast cancer

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and obesity and diabetes

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
already when the baby's in the womb.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
In addition to that, after the baby's born,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
our other unique invention as mammals

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
We already know that chemicals

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
like DDT and DES and atrazine

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
can also pass over into milk,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
again, affecting our babies

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
even after their born.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
PJC: So when Tyrone tells me

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that the placenta is an ancient organ,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
How do you show that?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
And it's interesting when you make a film like this,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
because you're stuck trying to visualize science

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
that there's no visualization for.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.260
(Video) (Ringing)

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Old man: Placenta control.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
What is it?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Oh what?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Snoring)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.260
(Honk)

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Puffuffuff, what?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Perflourooctanoic acid.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Blimey.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Never heard of it.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260
PJC: And neither had I actually

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
before I started making this film.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and go into your unborn child,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
it made me start to think,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
what would my fetus say to me?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
What would our unborn children say to us

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
when they have an exposure

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
that's happening everyday, day after day?

00:11:49.260 --> 00:12:07.260
(Music)

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
(Video) Child: Today,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I had some octyphenols,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
some artificial musks

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.260
and some bisphenol A.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Help me.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
PJC: It's a very profound notion

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
to know that we as women

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
are at the vanguard of this.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
This is our issue,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
because we collect these compounds our entire life

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and then we end up dumping it and dumping them

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
into our unborn children.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
We are in effect

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
polluting our children.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
when I found out I was pregnant

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
and the first scan revealed

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
that my baby had a birth defect

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
associated with exposure

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
to estrogenic chemicals in the womb

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and the second scan

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
revealed no heartbeat.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So my child's death, my baby's death,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And it's sometimes a weird place

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
when the communicator becomes part of the story,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
which is not what you originally intend.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And so when Tyrone talks about

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.260
this is my contaminated environment.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
This is my toxic baby.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
And that's something

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
that's just profound and sad,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
but astonishing

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
because so many of us don't actually know this.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
for me to be here at TEDWomen

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.260
is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
The truth is, women,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
to Sandra Steingraber's books

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
perhaps it's that connection

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that makes women activists

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
in this particular area.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
But for the men here, I want to say

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
it's not just women and children that are at risk.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
the testes are full of holes and spaces,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
because the hormone imbalance,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
instead of allowing sperm to be generated,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
such as in the testis here,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
the testicular tubules end up empty

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
It's not just my work in amphibians,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and in rats, an absence of sperm

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
in the testicular tubules as well.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
but just by coincidence,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
my colleague has shown

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
have significantly more atrazine in their urine.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
These are just men who live

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
in an agricultural community.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Men who actually work in agriculture

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
have much higher levels of atrazine.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And the men who actually apply atrazine

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
have even more atrazine in their urine,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
are present in the urine of these men.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
which was originally used as a nerve gas.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And many of these workers

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
have life expectancies of only 50.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
are also a warning to us,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
the agricultural runoff from this crop,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
which goes into these buckets,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Now if I told the men in this village

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
that the frogs have pour immune function

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
and eggs developing in their testes,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
the connection between environmental health and public health

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
would be clear.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
on the wildlife that lived in it.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
The problem is, in my village, Oakland,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
in most of our villages,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
we don't see that connection.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
and we assume that we are masters of our environment,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
rather than being part of it.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that actually this is an environmental issue.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
And I kept thinking over and over again

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
this question.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
We know so much about global warming and climate change,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and yet, we have no concept

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
We know what we're putting out there,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
we have a sense of those repercussions,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
but we are so ignorant of this sense

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
of what happens when we put things, or things are put

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
into our bodies.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
And it's my feeling

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and it's my urging being here

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
to know that, as we women move forward

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
as the communicators of this,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
but also as the ones who carry that burden

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
of carrying the children, bearing the children,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
we hold most of the buying power in the household,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
is that it's going to be us moving forward

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
And my urging is

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
that when we think about environmental issues

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.260
that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
but it's also about our children as well.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Thank you.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:42.260
(Applause)
