00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Can any of you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
remember what you wanted to be

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
when you were 17?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Do you know what I wanted to be?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I wanted to be a biker chick.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
(Laughter)

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I wanted to race cars,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and I wanted to be a cowgirl,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Because they were all about being free,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
the wind in your hair -- just to be free.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
gave me one driving lesson

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
for my seventeenth birthday.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Not that we could have afforded I drive,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but to give me the dream of driving.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I accompanied my little sister

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
in complete innocence,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
as I always had all my life --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
my visually impaired sister --

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
to go to see an eye specialist.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Because big sisters

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
are always supposed to support their little sisters.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
God help her.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So I used to get my eyes tested

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
just for fun.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
after my fake eye exam,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And I took that driving lesson,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And then there was a silence --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
one of those awful silences

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
when you know something's wrong.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And he turned to my mother,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and he said, "You haven't told her yet?"

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
On my seventeenth birthday,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
as Janis Ian would best say,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I learned the truth at 17.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I am, and have been since birth,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
legally blind.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And you know,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
how on earth did I get to 17

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
and not know that?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
let me tell you this:

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I got there

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
because my father's passion for Johnny Cash

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and a song, "A Boy Named Sue."

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And very shortly after my birth,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And what the hell does that mean to you?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I might buy some more time.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
But more importantly, let me tell you --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Hey.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
See this hand?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Every man in this room, even you, Steve,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
is George Clooney.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
(Laughter)

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And every woman, you are so beautiful.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
from all the squinting I've done all my life

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
from all the dark lights.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
The really strange part is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
my parents made a bizarre, unusual

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and incredibly brave decision.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
No special needs schools.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
No labels.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
No limitations.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
My ability and my potential.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And they decided to tell me

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that I could see.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
a boy given a girl's name,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
I would grow up and learn from experience

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
how to be tough and how to survive,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
when they were no longer there to protect me,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
or just take it all away.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But more significantly,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
they gave me the ability

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to believe,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
totally, to believe that I could.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And so when I heard that eye specialist

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
tell me all the things, a big fat "no,"

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
everybody imagines I was devastated.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I got that thump in my chest,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
just that "huh?"

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The first thing I thought about was my mom,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
who was crying over beside me.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
"I will drive. I will drive.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And with the same dogged determination

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that my father had bred into me since I was such a child --

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
he taught me how to sail,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
But he told me to believe

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and feel the wind in my face.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And that wind in my face made me believe

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that he was mad and I would drive.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And for the next 11 years,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
because I didn't want to be a failure,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and I didn't want to be weak.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And I believed I could do it.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And then I went to business school.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And they didn't even know.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And it's extraordinary

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
how far belief can take you.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
In 1999,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
two and a half years into that job,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
something happened.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And temporarily,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
very unexpectedly,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
they dropped.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
And two years in,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I really could see very little.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
And I found myself in front of an HR manager

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
in 1999,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
saying something I never imagined that I would say.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
I was 28 years old.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And I simply said,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
"I'm sorry.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I can't see, and I need help."

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
We all know how hard it is

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to admit weakness and failure.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And it's frightening, isn't it?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
But all that belief had fueled me so long.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
it's kind of difficult -- it really is.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Oh, for the love of God.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And please, any designers out there?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
I always end up in the gents' toilets.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
But can I just tell you,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
is determined by a triangle.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Have you ever tried to see that

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
It's such a small thing, right?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And you know how exhausting it can be

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to try to be perfect when you're not,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
or to be somebody that you aren't?

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
they sent me off to an eye specialist.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
But before I got to him, I was so lost.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
I had no idea who I was anymore.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
God no, it was therapy.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And he asked me several questions,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
of which many were, "Why?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Why are you fighting so hard

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
not to be yourself?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And do you love what you do, Caroline?"

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
they put a chip in your head, and you're like,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
To leave would be failure.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And he said, "Do you love it?"

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
I just was so -- how do I tell him?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
He thought I was mad enough anyway.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And as I left his office,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
he called me back

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and he said, "I think it's time.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
I think it's time

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
to stop fighting and do something different."

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
And that door closed.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And that silence just outside a doctor's office,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
that many of us know.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And my chest ached.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
But I did know the game was up.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I thought, "I'll go out for a run."

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Really not a very sensible thing to do.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
And I went on a run that I know so well.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
I always run it perfectly fine.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And there was a rock that I always missed.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And I'd never fallen on it, never.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And there I was crying away,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and smash, bash on my rock.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Broken, fallen over

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
on this rock

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in the middle of March in 2000,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
gray, snot, tears everywhere,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
ridiculously self-pitying.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And I was floored, and I was broken,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and I was angry.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And I didn't know what to do.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And I sat there for quite some time going,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Because who am I going to be?

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
What am I going to be?"

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And I thought about my dad,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And you know, the extraordinary part of it

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
is I just simply had no answers.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
I had lost my belief.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Look where my belief had brought me to.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I was crumpled.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Do something different. What do you want to be?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Do something different. What do you want to be?"

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
And really slowly, slowly, slowly,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
it happened.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And it did happen this way.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And then the minute it came,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
it blew up in my head

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and bashed in my heart --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
something different.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
You don't get more different than that."

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
And the moment, and I mean the moment,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
the moment that hit me,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
I swear to God,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And nobody can tell me no.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
going, "I know what I'm going to do.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I know how to be Mowgli.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I'm going to go across India

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
on the back of an elephant.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
I'm going to be an elephant handler."

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And I had no idea

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
how I was going to be an elephant handler.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
From global management consultant to elephant handler.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
But I knew I would.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
God, that universe makes it happen for you.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
I had the only blind date in my life

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
across India.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Applause)

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
The most powerful thing of all,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Because I wasn't believing in me,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
really me, all the bits of me --

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
all the bits of all of us.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
it's extraordinary what happens.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Six thousand people got to see because of that.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
When I came home off that elephant,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
do you know what the most amazing part was?

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
I chucked in my job at Accenture.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
which deals with Asian elephant conservation.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
And I set up Kanchi,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
because disability is like the elephant in the room.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
no charity, no pity.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But I wanted to work only and truly

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
with business and media leadership

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
to totally reframe disability

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
in a way that was exciting and possible.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
It was extraordinary.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
That's what I wanted to do.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
or any of that kind of nothing.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
It just seemed that it was possible.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
And you know, the oddest part is,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
when I was on my way traveling here to TED,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
I'll be honest, I was petrified.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And I speak,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
but this is an amazing audience,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and what am I doing here?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
But as I was traveling here,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
you'll be very happy to know,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
I did use my white symbol stick cane,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And I got my way here

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
being happily proud that I couldn't see.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Even though I present confident, I was scared.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
He said, "Be you."

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
And so here I am.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
This is me, all of me.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:19.260
(Applause)

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
And I have learned, you know what,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
cars and motorbikes and elephants,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that's not freedom.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And I never needed eyes to see -- never.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
I simply needed vision and belief.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And if you truly believe --

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
you can make change happen.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And we need to make it happen,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
because every single one of us --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
woman, man, gay, straight,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
disabled, perfect,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
normal, whatever --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
everyone of us

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
must be the very best of ourselves.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
I no longer want anybody to be invisible.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
We all have to be included.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And stop with the labels, the limiting.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Losing of labels,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
because we are not jam jars.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Thank you.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:27.260
(Applause)
