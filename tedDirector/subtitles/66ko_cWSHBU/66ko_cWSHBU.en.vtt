00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:16.537
My colleagues and I are fascinated
by the science of moving dots.

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:18.077
So what are these dots?

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.388
Well, it's all of us.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:24.497
And we're moving in our homes,
in our offices, as we shop and travel

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.587
throughout our cities
and around the world.

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.627
And wouldn't it be great
if we could understand all this movement?

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:33.808
If we could find patterns and meaning
and insight in it.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.044
And luckily for us, we live in a time

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:40.565
where we're incredibly good
at capturing information about ourselves.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:44.470
So whether it's through
sensors or videos, or apps,

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.303
we can track our movement
with incredibly fine detail.

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:53.124
So it turns out one of the places
where we have the best data about movement

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:54.356
is sports.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:01:00.015
So whether it's basketball or baseball,
or football or the other football,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.441
we're instrumenting our stadiums
and our players to track their movements

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:05.778
every fraction of a second.

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:10.184
So what we're doing
is turning our athletes into --

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.167
you probably guessed it --

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:13.587
moving dots.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:18.880
So we've got mountains of moving dots
and like most raw data,

00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:21.406
it's hard to deal with
and not that interesting.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.199
But there are things that, for example,
basketball coaches want to know.

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:29.033
And the problem is they can't know them
because they'd have to watch every second

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:31.646
of every game, remember it and process it.

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.734
And a person can't do that,

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:35.068
but a machine can.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.071
The problem is a machine can't see
the game with the eye of a coach.

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:41.624
At least they couldn't until now.

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:44.331
So what have we taught the machine to see?

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.356
So, we started simply.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.179
We taught it things like passes,
shots and rebounds.

00:01:51.203 --> 00:01:53.744
Things that most casual fans would know.

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:56.600
And then we moved on to things
slightly more complicated.

00:01:56.624 --> 00:02:01.212
Events like post-ups,
and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:04.920
And if you don't know them, that's okay.
Most casual players probably do.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.900
Now, we've gotten to a point where today,
the machine understands complex events

00:02:10.924 --> 00:02:13.997
like down screens and wide pins.

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.747
Basically things only professionals know.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:21.159
So we have taught a machine to see
with the eyes of a coach.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.866
So how have we been able to do this?

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.629
If I asked a coach to describe
something like a pick-and-roll,

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:29.293
they would give me a description,

00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:32.173
and if I encoded that as an algorithm,
it would be terrible.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:37.304
The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance
in basketball between four players,

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:39.240
two on offense and two on defense.

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:41.104
And here's kind of how it goes.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.661
So there's the guy on offense
without the ball

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.894
the ball and he goes next to the guy
guarding the guy with the ball,

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:48.175
and he kind of stays there

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.516
and they both move and stuff happens,
and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.755
(Laughter)

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.287
So that is also an example
of a terrible algorithm.

00:02:56.913 --> 00:03:01.117
So, if the player who's the interferer --
he's called the screener --

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.150
goes close by, but he doesn't stop,

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:05.939
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.505
Or if he does stop,
but he doesn't stop close enough,

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.290
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.879
Or, if he does go close by
and he does stop

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:19.227
but they do it under the basket,
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:21.986
Or I could be wrong,
they could all be pick-and-rolls.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.578
It really depends on the exact timing,
the distances, the locations,

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:28.097
and that's what makes it hard.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.523
So, luckily, with machine learning,
we can go beyond our own ability

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.290
to describe the things we know.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.594
So how does this work?
Well, it's by example.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.589
So we go to the machine and say,
"Good morning, machine.

00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:44.436
Here are some pick-and-rolls,
and here are some things that are not.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.972
Please find a way to tell the difference."

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:50.783
And the key to all of this is to find
features that enable it to separate.

00:03:50.807 --> 00:03:52.916
So if I was going
to teach it the difference

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.321
between an apple and orange,

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:56.720
I might say, "Why don't you
use color or shape?"

00:03:56.744 --> 00:03:59.687
And the problem that we're solving is,
what are those things?

00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:00.958
What are the key features

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:04.481
that let a computer navigate
the world of moving dots?

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:09.328
So figuring out all these relationships
with relative and absolute location,

00:04:09.352 --> 00:04:11.261
distance, timing, velocities --

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.368
that's really the key to the science
of moving dots, or as we like to call it,

00:04:16.392 --> 00:04:19.736
spatiotemporal pattern recognition,
in academic vernacular.

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:22.823
Because the first thing is,
you have to make it sound hard --

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:24.125
because it is.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.551
The key thing is, for NBA coaches,
it's not that they want to know

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:29.497
whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.597
It's that they want to know
how it happened.

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:34.607
And why is it so important to them?
So here's a little insight.

00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.402
It turns out in modern basketball,

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:38.965
this pick-and-roll is perhaps
the most important play.

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:41.685
And knowing how to run it,
and knowing how to defend it,

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:44.379
is basically a key to winning
and losing most games.

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:48.204
So it turns out that this dance
has a great many variations

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:51.876
and identifying the variations
is really the thing that matters,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.429
and that's why we need this
to be really, really good.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.404
So, here's an example.

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:58.807
There are two offensive
and two defensive players,

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.983
getting ready to do
the pick-and-roll dance.

00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.690
So the guy with ball
can either take, or he can reject.

00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:07.087
His teammate can either roll or pop.

00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:10.097
The guy guarding the ball
can either go over or under.

00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:14.686
His teammate can either show
or play up to touch, or play soft

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.328
and together they can
either switch or blitz

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:20.011
and I didn't know
most of these things when I started

00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:23.955
and it would be lovely if everybody moved
according to those arrows.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.884
It would make our lives a lot easier,
but it turns out movement is very messy.

00:05:28.047 --> 00:05:33.531
People wiggle a lot and getting
these variations identified

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:34.858
with very high accuracy,

00:05:34.882 --> 00:05:36.750
both in precision and recall, is tough

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:40.392
because that's what it takes to get
a professional coach to believe in you.

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:43.796
And despite all the difficulties
with the right spatiotemporal features

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.294
we have been able to do that.

00:05:45.318 --> 00:05:49.245
Coaches trust our ability of our machine
to identify these variations.

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:53.011
We're at the point where
almost every single contender

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:54.658
for an NBA championship this year

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:59.090
is using our software, which is built
on a machine that understands

00:05:59.114 --> 00:06:00.748
the moving dots of basketball.

00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:07.025
So not only that, we have given advice
that has changed strategies

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:10.401
that have helped teams win
very important games,

00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:14.157
and it's very exciting because you have
coaches who've been in the league

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.248
for 30 years that are willing to take
advice from a machine.

00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:20.780
And it's very exciting,
it's much more than the pick-and-roll.

00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:22.880
Our computer started out
with simple things

00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.968
and learned more and more complex things

00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:26.553
and now it knows so many things.

00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:29.412
Frankly, I don't understand
much of what it does,

00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:33.151
and while it's not that special
to be smarter than me,

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:36.819
we were wondering,
can a machine know more than a coach?

00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:38.898
Can it know more than person could know?

00:06:38.922 --> 00:06:40.667
And it turns out the answer is yes.

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.248
The coaches want players
to take good shots.

00:06:43.272 --> 00:06:44.923
So if I'm standing near the basket

00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:47.113
and there's nobody near me,
it's a good shot.

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:51.077
If I'm standing far away surrounded
by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.

00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:55.977
But we never knew how good "good" was,
or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.359
Until now.

00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:00.829
So what we can do, again,
using spatiotemporal features,

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.227
we looked at every shot.

00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:05.256
We can see: Where is the shot?
What's the angle to the basket?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.042
Where are the defenders standing?
What are their distances?

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:09.397
What are their angles?

00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.398
For multiple defenders, we can look
at how the player's moving

00:07:12.422 --> 00:07:13.855
and predict the shot type.

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.953
We can look at all their velocities
and we can build a model that predicts

00:07:17.977 --> 00:07:22.029
what is the likelihood that this shot
would go in under these circumstances?

00:07:22.188 --> 00:07:23.688
So why is this important?

00:07:24.102 --> 00:07:26.905
We can take something that was shooting,

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.609
which was one thing before,
and turn it into two things:

00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:32.284
the quality of the shot
and the quality of the shooter.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.942
So here's a bubble chart,
because what's TED without a bubble chart?

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:37.980
(Laughter)

00:07:38.004 --> 00:07:39.315
Those are NBA players.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:42.459
The size is the size of the player
and the color is the position.

00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:44.615
On the x-axis,
we have the shot probability.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.592
People on the left take difficult shots,

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:48.845
on the right, they take easy shots.

00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:51.251
On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.837
People who are good are at the top,
bad at the bottom.

00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.621
So for example, if there was a player

00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:57.718
who generally made
47 percent of their shots,

00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:59.107
that's all you knew before.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:04.195
But today, I can tell you that player
takes shots that an average NBA player

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:06.180
would make 49 percent of the time,

00:08:06.204 --> 00:08:07.888
and they are two percent worse.

00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:12.781
And the reason that's important
is that there are lots of 47s out there.

00:08:13.714 --> 00:08:16.263
And so it's really important to know

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:20.243
if the 47 that you're considering
giving 100 million dollars to

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:23.322
is a good shooter who takes bad shots

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:25.743
or a bad shooter who takes good shots.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.463
Machine understanding doesn't just change
how we look at players,

00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:32.345
it changes how we look at the game.

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:36.124
So there was this very exciting game
a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:39.355
Miami was down by three,
there was 20 seconds left.

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:41.404
They were about to lose the championship.

00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:44.769
A gentleman named LeBron James
came up and he took a three to tie.

00:08:44.793 --> 00:08:45.991
He missed.

00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:47.852
His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:50.035
passed it to another teammate
named Ray Allen.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:51.978
He sank a three. It went into overtime.

00:08:52.002 --> 00:08:54.098
They won the game.
They won the championship.

00:08:54.122 --> 00:08:56.566
It was one of the most exciting
games in basketball.

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.867
And our ability to know
the shot probability for every player

00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:02.079
at every second,

00:09:02.103 --> 00:09:05.059
and the likelihood of them getting
a rebound at every second

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:08.526
can illuminate this moment in a way
that we never could before.

00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:12.286
Now unfortunately,
I can't show you that video.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.803
But for you, we recreated that moment

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.163
at our weekly basketball game
about 3 weeks ago.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.446
(Laughter)

00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:24.983
And we recreated the tracking
that led to the insights.

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:29.454
So, here is us.
This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,

00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:31.042
a park we play at every week,

00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:33.297
and that's us recreating
the Ray Allen moment

00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.550
and all the tracking
that's associated with it.

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:38.289
So, here's the shot.

00:09:38.313 --> 00:09:40.829
I'm going to show you that moment

00:09:40.853 --> 00:09:43.440
and all the insights of that moment.

00:09:43.464 --> 00:09:47.194
The only difference is, instead
of the professional players, it's us,

00:09:47.218 --> 00:09:49.836
and instead of a professional
announcer, it's me.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.337
So, bear with me.

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:54.303
Miami.

00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:55.821
Down three.

00:09:56.107 --> 00:09:57.257
Twenty seconds left.

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:00.583
Jeff brings up the ball.

00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:04.191
Josh catches, puts up a three!

00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:06.480
[Calculating shot probability]

00:10:07.278 --> 00:10:08.428
[Shot quality]

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:10.833
[Rebound probability]

00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:13.546
Won't go!

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.016
[Rebound probability]

00:10:15.777 --> 00:10:17.033
Rebound, Noel.

00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:18.207
Back to Daria.

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:21.874
[Shot quality]

00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:24.296
Her three-pointer -- bang!

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.517
Tie game with five seconds left.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.498
The crowd goes wild.

00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:30.181
(Laughter)

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:31.752
That's roughly how it happened.

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:32.927
(Applause)

00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:34.126
Roughly.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.681
(Applause)

00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:41.605
That moment had about a nine percent
chance of happening in the NBA

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:43.890
and we know that
and a great many other things.

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:47.405
I'm not going to tell you how many times
it took us to make that happen.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.176
(Laughter)

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.072
Okay, I will! It was four.

00:10:51.096 --> 00:10:52.097
(Laughter)

00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:53.286
Way to go, Daria.

00:10:53.647 --> 00:10:57.910
But the important thing about that video

00:10:57.934 --> 00:11:02.502
and the insights we have for every second
of every NBA game -- it's not that.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:06.568
It's the fact you don't have to be
a professional team to track movement.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.740
You do not have to be a professional
player to get insights about movement.

00:11:10.764 --> 00:11:14.622
In fact, it doesn't even have to be about
sports because we're moving everywhere.

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:18.023
We're moving in our homes,

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:22.633
in our offices,

00:11:24.238 --> 00:11:26.928
as we shop and we travel

00:11:29.318 --> 00:11:30.571
throughout our cities

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:33.683
and around our world.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.565
What will we know? What will we learn?

00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:39.894
Perhaps, instead of identifying
pick-and-rolls,

00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:42.928
a machine can identify
the moment and let me know

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.011
when my daughter takes her first steps.

00:11:45.035 --> 00:11:47.571
Which could literally be happening
any second now.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.837
Perhaps we can learn to better use
our buildings, better plan our cities.

00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:56.535
I believe that with the development
of the science of moving dots,

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:00.202
we will move better, we will move smarter,
we will move forward.

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:01.796
Thank you very much.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.865
(Applause)
