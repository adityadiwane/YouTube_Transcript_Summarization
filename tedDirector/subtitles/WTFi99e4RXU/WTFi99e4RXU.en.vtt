00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:16.757
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:20.316
My father has just built the best outhouse

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.906
in our little village in Ukraine.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.455
Inside, it's a smelly,
gaping hole in the ground,

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.461
but outside, it's pearly white formica

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:34.089
and it literally gleams in the sun.

00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:37.646
This makes me feel so proud, so important,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.686
that I appoint myself the leader
of my little group of friends

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.466
and I devise missions for us.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.779
So we prowl from house to house

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:49.146
looking for flies captured in spider webs

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.533
and we set them free.

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.841
Four years earlier, when I was one,

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.286
after the Chernobyl accident,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.617
the rain came down black,

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.817
and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.374
and I spent nine months in the hospital.

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:03.926
There were no visitors allowed,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.938
so my mother bribed a hospital worker.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.669
She acquired a nurse's uniform,

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:15.014
and she snuck in every night
to sit by my side.

00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:18.074
Five years later,
an unexpected silver lining.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:22.176
Thanks to Chernobyl,
we get asylum in the U.S.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.395
I am six years old, and I don't
cry when we leave home

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.446
and we come to America,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.194
because I expect it to be
a place filled with rare

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:35.374
and wonderful things
like bananas and chocolate

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:37.815
and Bazooka bubble gum,

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:41.908
Bazooka bubble gum
with the little cartoon wrappers inside,

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:45.025
Bazooka that we'd get
once a year in Ukraine

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.061
and we'd have to chew
one piece for an entire week.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:50.867
So the first day we get to New York,

00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.100
my grandmother and I find a penny

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:56.843
in the floor of the homeless shelter
that my family's staying in.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.378
Only, we don't know
that it's a homeless shelter.

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:01.469
We think that it's a hotel,
a hotel with lots of rats.

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:06.051
So we find this penny kind
of fossilized in the floor,

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:09.047
and we think that a very wealthy
man must have left it there

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.541
because regular people
don't just lose money.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.098
And I hold this penny
in the palm of my hand,

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:16.760
and it's sticky and rusty,

00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:19.791
but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.101
I decide that I'm going
to get my very own piece

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:23.916
of Bazooka bubble gum.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.901
And in that moment, I feel
like a millionaire.

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:30.211
About a year later, I get
to feel that way again

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.970
when we find a bag full
of stuffed animals in the trash,

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:34.701
and suddenly I have more toys

00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:37.445
than I've ever had in my whole life.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.830
And again, I get that feeling
when we get a knock

00:02:39.854 --> 00:02:41.807
on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:44.116
and my sister and I find a deliveryman

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.669
with a box of pizza that we didn't order.

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:49.858
So we take the pizza,
our very first pizza,

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:52.697
and we devour slice after slice

00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:56.086
as the deliveryman stands there
and stares at us from the doorway.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.086
And he tells us to pay,
but we don't speak English.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.514
My mother comes out,
and he asks her for money,

00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:02.872
but she doesn't have enough.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:06.224
She walks 50 blocks
to and from work every day

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:08.893
just to avoid spending money on bus fare.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.759
Then our neighbor pops her head in,

00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:13.349
and she turns red with rage
when she realizes

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:15.695
that those immigrants from downstairs

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.704
have somehow gotten
their hands on her pizza.

00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:21.260
Everyone's upset.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:25.101
But the pizza is delicious.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:31.062
It doesn't hit me until years
later just how little we had.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.376
On our 10 year anniversary
of being in the U.S.,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.484
we decided to celebrate
by reserving a room

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:38.366
at the hotel that we first stayed
in when we got to the U.S.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.785
The man at the front desk
laughs, and he says,

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.667
"You can't reserve a room here.
This is a homeless shelter."

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.804
And we were shocked.

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:49.810
My husband Brian was also
homeless as a kid.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:52.900
His family lost everything, and at age 11,

00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:55.653
he had to live in motels with his dad,

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:58.586
motels
that would round up all of their food

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.266
and keep it hostage until they were
able to pay the bill.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.471
And one time, when he finally got his box

00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:08.067
of Frosted Flakes back, it
was crawling with roaches.

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:09.983
But he did have one thing.

00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:12.627
He had this shoebox that he carried
with him everywhere

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.090
containing nine comic books,

00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:18.236
two G.I. Joes painted
to look like Spider-Man

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.299
and five Gobots. And
this was his treasure.

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:24.294
This was his own assembly of heroes

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:26.497
that kept him from drugs and gangs

00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:29.293
and from giving up on his dreams.

00:04:29.317 --> 00:04:30.341
I'm going to tell you about one more

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:33.132
formerly homeless member of our family.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:34.831
This is Scarlett.

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:37.900
Once upon a time, Scarlet
was used as bait in dog fights.

00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.316
She was tied up and thrown into the ring

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.352
for other dogs to attack so they'd get
more aggressive before the fight.

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:48.592
And now, these days, she eats organic food

00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:51.283
and she sleeps on an orthopedic
bed with her name on it,

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:55.535
but when we pour water
for her in her bowl,

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.524
she still looks up and she wags
her tail in gratitude.

00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:02.742
Sometimes Brian and I walk
through the park with Scarlett,

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:05.161
and she rolls through the grass,

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:07.562
and we just look at her

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:09.382
and then we look at each other

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:13.389
and we feel gratitude.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:17.020
We forget about all of our new
middle-class frustrations

00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:18.895
and disappointments,

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.579
and we feel like millionaires.

00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:22.729
Thank you.

00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:26.746
(Applause)
