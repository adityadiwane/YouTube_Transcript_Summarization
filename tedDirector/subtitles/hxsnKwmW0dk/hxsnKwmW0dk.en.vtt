00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.976
When I think about dreams,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.876
like many of you,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.585
I think about this picture.

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.875
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.113
step off the Lunar Module
onto the surface of the Moon.

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:32.684
I had never seen anything like it before,

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.946
and I've never seen
anything like it since.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.613
We got to the Moon for one simple reason:

00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:43.943
John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.470
And in the absence of that deadline,

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:49.501
we would still be dreaming about it.

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:55.877
Leonard Bernstein said two things
are necessary for great achievement:

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:59.366
a plan and not quite enough time.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.520
(Laughter)

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:08.345
Deadlines and commitments

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.382
are the great and fading
lessons of Apollo.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:18.545
And they are what give the word
"moonshot" its meaning.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:24.220
And our world is in desperate need
of political leaders

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:28.029
willing to set bold deadlines

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:31.981
for the achievement of daring dreams
on the scale of Apollo again.

00:01:34.368 --> 00:01:35.861
When I think about dreams,

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:39.934
I think about the drag queens
of LA and Stonewall

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.307
and millions of other people
risking everything

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.643
to come out when that
was really dangerous,

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:49.388
and of this picture of the White House
lit up in rainbow colors,

00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:50.570
yes --

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:56.373
(Applause) --

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:59.885
celebrating America's gay and lesbian
citizens' right to marry.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.156
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams
I could never have imagined

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.908
when I was 18

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:09.932
and figuring out that I was gay

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:13.623
and feeling estranged from my country

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:16.043
and my dreams because of it.

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:21.210
I think about this picture of my family

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:25.257
that I never dreamed I could ever have --

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:31.117
(Applause) --

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.067
and of our children holding this headline

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:38.852
I never dreamed could ever be printed
about the Supreme Court ruling.

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:46.295
We need more of the courage
of drag queens and astronauts.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.645
(Laughter)

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.342
(Applause)

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:54.708
But I want to talk
about the need for us to dream

00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:56.818
in more than one dimension,

00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:02.248
because there was something about Apollo
that I didn't know when I was 8,

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:06.533
and something about organizing
that the rainbow colors over.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.778
Of the 30 astronauts in the original
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:16.310
only seven marriages survived.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.474
Those iconic images of the astronauts
bouncing on the Moon

00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:25.510
obscure the alcoholism
and depression on Earth.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.517
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.956
asked during the time of Apollo,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.896
"What can we gain by sailing to the moon

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.427
if we are not able to cross the abyss
that separates us from ourselves?"

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.372
And what can we gain by the right to marry

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:49.539
if we are not able to cross the acrimony

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:54.089
and emotional distance
that so often separates us from our love?

00:03:54.596 --> 00:03:56.581
And not just in marriage.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.024
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:08.429
tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS

00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:11.849
and breast cancer and non-profit activism,

00:04:11.873 --> 00:04:13.437
all in the name of love.

00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:19.615
Thomas Merton also wrote
about wars among saints

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.668
and that "there is a pervasive form
of contemporary violence

00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:30.041
to which the idealist
most easily succumbs:

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.906
activism and overwork.

00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:38.191
The frenzy of our activism
neutralizes our work for peace.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:42.533
It destroys our own
inner capacity for peace."

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:49.502
Too often our dreams become
these compartmentalized fixations

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:51.359
on some future

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:55.502
that destroy our ability to be present
for our lives right now.

00:04:56.926 --> 00:05:00.641
Our dreams of a better life
for some future humanity

00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:02.925
or some other humanity in another country

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.973
alienate us from the beautiful
human beings sitting next to us

00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:08.910
at this very moment.

00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:13.640
Well, that's just the price
of progress, we say.

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:15.077
You can go to the Moon

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.115
or you can have stability
in your family life.

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:23.988
And we can't conceive of dreaming
in both dimensions at the same time.

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:27.777
And we don't set the bar
much higher than stability

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:30.555
when it comes to our emotional life.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.915
Which is why our technology
for talking to one another

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:36.308
has gone vertical,

00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:40.038
our ability to listen
and understand one another

00:05:40.062 --> 00:05:41.232
has gone nowhere.

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:46.220
Our access to information
is through the roof,

00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:51.220
our access to joy, grounded.

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:59.314
But this idea, that our present
and our future are mutually exclusive,

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:03.334
that to fulfill our potential for doing
we have to surrender

00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:06.521
our profound potential for being,

00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:10.456
that the number of transistors
on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.782
but our capacity for compassion
and humanity and serenity and love

00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:16.884
is somehow limited

00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:19.874
is a false and suffocating choice.

00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.049
Now, I'm not suggesting

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:29.701
simply the uninspiring idea
of more work-life balance.

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.454
What good is it for me to spend
more time with my kids at home

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:37.263
if my mind is always somewhere else
while I'm doing it?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.565
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.961
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming
a tool for improving productivity.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:48.290
(Laughter)

00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:49.466
Right?

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.434
I'm talking about dreaming

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:57.219
as boldly in the dimension of our being

00:06:57.243 --> 00:06:59.727
as we do about industry and technology.

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.615
I'm talking about
an audacious authenticity

00:07:04.536 --> 00:07:07.528
that allows us to cry with one another,

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:13.826
a heroic humility that allows us
to remove our masks and be real.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.375
It is our inability
to be with one another,

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.733
our fear of crying with one another,
that gives rise to so many

00:07:20.757 --> 00:07:24.051
of the problems we are frantically
trying to solve in the first place,

00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:27.375
from Congressional gridlock
to economic inhumanity.

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:31.364
(Applause)

00:07:31.388 --> 00:07:35.435
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk
called an Epoch B,

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:41.070
a new epoch in which we become
as excited about and curious about

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:45.103
and scientific about
the development of our humanity

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:47.722
as we are about the development
of our technology.

00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.802
We should not shrink from this opportunity

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:54.595
simply because
we don't really understand it.

00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:57.972
There was a time
when we didn't understand space.

00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:02.150
Or because we're more used
to technology and activism.

00:08:02.174 --> 00:08:05.445
That is the very definition
of being stuck in a comfort zone.

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:11.103
We are now very comfortable imagining
unimaginable technological achievement.

00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:15.993
In 2016, it is the dimension
of our being itself

00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:21.147
that cries out for its fair share
of our imagination.

00:08:23.782 --> 00:08:26.107
Now, we're all here to dream,

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.799
but maybe if we're honest about it,

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:30.512
each of us chasing our own dream.

00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:34.306
You know, looking at the name tags
to see who can help me with my dream,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.426
sometimes looking right through
one another's humanity.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.156
I can't be bothered with you right now.
I have an idea for saving the world.

00:08:41.513 --> 00:08:42.665
Right?

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.806
(Laughter)

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.306
Years ago, once upon a time,
I had this beautiful company

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.290
that created these long journeys
for heroic civic engagement.

00:08:54.647 --> 00:08:56.694
And we had this mantra:

00:08:56.718 --> 00:09:00.535
"Human. Kind. Be Both."

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:07.075
And we encouraged people to experiment
outrageously with kindness.

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:10.360
Like, "Go help everybody
set up their tents."

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.971
And there were a lot of tents.

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.265
(Laughter)

00:09:16.043 --> 00:09:17.766
"Go buy everybody Popsicles."

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.671
"Go help people fix their flat tires

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.621
even though you know
the dinner line is going to get longer."

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.019
And people really took us up on this,

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:27.670
so much so that if you got
a flat tire on the AIDS ride,

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:31.321
you had trouble fixing it, because there
were so many people there asking you

00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:32.495
if you needed help.

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:37.354
For a few days,
for tens of thousands of people,

00:09:37.378 --> 00:09:39.292
we created these worlds

00:09:39.316 --> 00:09:43.522
that everybody said were the way
they wish the world could always be.

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:50.823
What if we experimented
with creating that kind of world

00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:52.485
these next few days?

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:57.965
And instead of going up to someone
and asking them, "What do you do?"

00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:01.264
ask them, "So what are your dreams?"

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:04.283
or "What are your broken dreams?"

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:10.163
You know, "TED."
Tend to Each other's Dreams.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.599
(Applause)

00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:18.179
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"

00:10:18.203 --> 00:10:20.869
or "I want to build
a tree house with my kid."

00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:24.704
You know, instead of going up
to the person everybody wants to meet,

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:26.485
go up to the person who is all alone

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:29.196
and ask them if they want
to grab a cup of coffee.

00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:33.020
I think what we fear most

00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:37.400
is that we will be denied the opportunity
to fulfill our true potential,

00:10:37.424 --> 00:10:40.035
that we are born to dream

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:43.671
and we might die
without ever having the chance.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.258
Imagine living in a world

00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:53.479
where we simply recognize
that deep, existential fear in one another

00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:56.635
and love one another boldly
because we know

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:00.222
that to be human
is to live with that fear.

00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:07.341
It's time for us to dream
in multiple dimensions simultaneously,

00:11:08.262 --> 00:11:12.230
and somewhere that transcends
all of the wondrous things

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:15.904
we can and will and must do

00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:22.087
lies the domain of all
the unbelievable things we could be.

00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:27.206
It's time we set foot into that dimension

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.983
and came out about the fact
that we have dreams there, too.

00:11:33.214 --> 00:11:36.079
If the Moon could dream,

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:41.952
I think that would be its dream for us.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.179
It's an honor to be with you.

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:47.112
Thank you very much.

00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:54.136
(Applause)
