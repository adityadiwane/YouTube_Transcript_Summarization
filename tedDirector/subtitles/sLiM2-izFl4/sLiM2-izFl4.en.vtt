00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:20.369
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.675
in children's homes and foster care,

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.723
you could say that I'm an expert on the subject,

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:29.281
and in being an expert, I want to let you know that

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:34.888
being an expert does in no way make you right

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:37.888
in light of the truth.

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:42.076
If you're in care, legally the government is your

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:45.803
parent, loco parentis.

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:49.752
Margaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:53.401
Let's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.539
Harry Potter was a foster child.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.579
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.661
Superman was a foster child;

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.189
Cinderella was a foster child;

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.797
Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,

00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:14.719
was fostered and institutionalized;

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.094
Batman was orphaned;

00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:22.792
Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:24.481
was fostered;

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.216
Jane Eyre, adopted;

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:31.799
Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.311
Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter)

00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:39.758
Moses! (Laughter) --

00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:44.254
the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:48.070
Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.654
Luke Skywalker --

00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:53.525
Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) --

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:55.812
Oliver Twist;

00:01:55.812 --> 00:02:00.023
Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:03.380
Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.992
All of these great fictional characters, all of them

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:11.989
who were hurt by their condition,

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.637
all of them who spawned thousands of other books

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:19.092
and other films, all of them

00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:23.245
were fostered, adopted or orphaned.

00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:28.809
It seems that writers know that the child

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:35.958
outside of family reflects on what family truly is

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.548
more than what it promotes itself to be.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:44.515
That is, they also use extraordinary skills

00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:49.344
to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:52.866
How have we not made the connection?

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:56.904
And why have we not made the connection, between

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.104
— How has that happened? —

00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:02.672
between these incredible characters of popular culture

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:07.760
and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.392
in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.993
It's our respect.

00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:17.610
I know famous musicians,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.682
I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:26.183
and top lawyers and television executives

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:28.633
and magazine editors and national journalists

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:31.474
and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:35.010
looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.682
and many of them grow into their adult lives

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:41.953
in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may

00:03:41.953 --> 00:03:46.260
somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.302
as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb

00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:54.349
strapped on the inside. Children in care,

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.483
who've had a life in care, deserve the right

00:03:57.483 --> 00:04:03.333
to own and live the memory of their own childhood.

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:05.612
It is that simple.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:09.618
My own mother — and I should say this here —

00:04:09.618 --> 00:04:13.472
she same to this country in the late '60s,

00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:17.237
and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:19.332
as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:21.281
They found themselves pregnant.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.955
And she sort of, she had no idea of the context

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:30.075
in which she'd landed.

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:33.923
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s,

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:37.274
if you were pregnant and you were single,

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:40.175
you were seen as a threat to the community.

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:46.034
You were separated from your family by the state.

00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:48.736
You were separated from your family and placed into

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:50.858
mother and baby homes.

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.999
You were appointed a social worker.

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.389
The adoptive parents were lined up.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.474
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:03.815
to get the woman at her most vulnerable time

00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:09.168
in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.

00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:11.053
So the adoption papers were signed.

00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:14.623
The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.

00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:17.799
The adoption papers were signed,

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:21.495
the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother

00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:23.919
shipped back to her community

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.910
to say that she'd been on a little break.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.596
A little break.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.274
A little break.

00:05:31.274 --> 00:05:34.839
The first secret of shame for a woman

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.918
for being a woman, "a little break."

00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:43.009
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months,

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.889
so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.394
an industrious, utilitarian solution:

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.752
the government, the farmer,

00:05:56.752 --> 00:06:00.599
the adopting parents, the consumer,

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.401
the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.

00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:10.055
It's kind of easy to patronize the past,

00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:14.959
to forego our responsibilities in the present.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.811
What happened then is a direct reflection

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:24.055
of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves

00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:28.592
to be doing the right thing by God and by the state

00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:35.479
for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.672
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:45.750
and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.448
its own jubilee at the time

00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:51.218
under the Emperor Haile Selassie,

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:56.344
and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,

00:06:56.344 --> 00:06:58.464
the "Rivers of Blood" speech.

00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:03.086
She lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"

00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:05.770
months before Martin Luther King was killed.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.221
It was a summer of love if you were white.

00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:11.913
If you were black, it was a summer of hate.

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:17.563
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:21.923
to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.

00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:26.163
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --

00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:30.434
It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:34.009
while she studies. But the social worker,

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.003
he had a different agenda.

00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:41.210
He found the foster parents, and he said to them,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.042
"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:48.489
His name is Norman." (Laughter)

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:50.826
Norman! (Laughter)

00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:53.538
Norman!

00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:59.764
So they took me. I was a message, they said.

00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:02.223
I was a sign from God, they said.

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:05.967
I was Norman Mark Greenwood.

00:08:05.967 --> 00:08:09.386
Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:11.974
this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:14.976
for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:18.053
too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years

00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:20.809
kneeling and praying.

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:23.930
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.738
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"

00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:32.086
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.700
(Laughter)

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.437
And then I was supposed to determine whether that

00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:39.969
was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:47.328
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:49.736
Who knew? (Laughter)

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:52.632
So anyway, two years sort of passed,

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.410
and they had a child of their own,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.874
and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,

00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:59.165
and then another time passed

00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:01.742
and they had another child that they called an accident,

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:05.150
which I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.879
And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:13.284
so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:17.061
I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:20.464
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete,

00:09:20.464 --> 00:09:22.901
my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,

00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:26.169
as they said they were, my mom and dad

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:32.978
conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.

00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:35.036
And what -- I should say this here, because this is how

00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:36.995
they engineered my leaving.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:40.384
They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,

00:09:40.384 --> 00:09:42.452
"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.

00:09:42.452 --> 00:09:45.961
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.

00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:50.006
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.157
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:55.001
and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow

00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:57.944
and give my most honest and truthful answer.

00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.784
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me

00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:03.120
whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.985
which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.656
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:12.424
through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:15.209
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:18.112
and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.

00:10:18.112 --> 00:10:22.800
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.352
"Because you don't love us, Norman,

00:10:25.352 --> 00:10:27.696
clearly you've chosen your path."

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:30.494
Twenty-four hours later, my social worker,

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:33.543
this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,

00:10:33.543 --> 00:10:36.755
he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.

00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:39.331
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,

00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.159
my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:44.788
my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:48.335
On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,

00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:51.310
"What's happened to me?"

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.463
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me

00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:59.278
as much as the entire floor had been taken away.

00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:03.078
When I got to the —

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:07.461
For the next four, five years,

00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:12.314
I was held in four different children's homes.

00:11:12.314 --> 00:11:15.591
On the third children's home, at 15,

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.758
I started to rebel, and what I did was,

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:23.087
I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,

00:11:23.087 --> 00:11:26.918
and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home --

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:28.758
and I was in a little turret at the top of it,

00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:32.061
and I poured them, red, yellow and green,

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:37.102
the colors of Africa, down the tiles.

00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:39.606
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home

00:11:39.606 --> 00:11:42.058
was surrounded by beech trees.

00:11:42.058 --> 00:11:47.014
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:49.999
in an assessment center which was actually

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:54.719
a remand center. It was a virtual prison

00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:58.617
for young people.

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.670
By the way, years later, my social worker said

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.129
that I should never have been put in there.

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:04.784
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.

00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:09.510
But because I had no family to inquire about me,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:14.261
they could do anything to me.

00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:17.615
I'm 17 years old, and

00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:21.256
they had a padded cell.

00:12:21.256 --> 00:12:27.216
They would march me down corridors in last-size order.

00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:29.481
They -- I was put in a dormitory

00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:33.401
with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.

00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:36.723
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting --

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.737
and ex-probation officers.

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:42.800
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.960
Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.694
who would feed me grapes, once every three months,

00:12:49.694 --> 00:12:51.905
I was strip-searched.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:55.158
That home was full of young boys who were on remand

00:12:55.158 --> 00:13:00.426
for things like murder.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:04.458
And this was the preparation that I was being given

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:10.509
after 17 years as a child of the state.

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:13.092
I have to tell this story.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.362
I have to tell it, because there was no one

00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:18.315
to put two and two together.

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:21.342
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:24.836
that knew me for longer than a year.

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:27.685
See, that's what family does.

00:13:27.685 --> 00:13:30.076
It gives you reference points.

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:32.564
I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.

00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:34.380
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.036
by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:38.983
a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,

00:13:38.983 --> 00:13:40.993
a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,

00:13:40.993 --> 00:13:43.280
and therefore it matters to you. Understand,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.509
I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:52.291
and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.

00:13:52.291 --> 00:14:00.418
I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:03.633
when I left the children's home I had two things

00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:07.430
that I wanted to do. One was to find my family,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.960
and the other was to write poetry.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.509
In creativity I saw light.

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:16.671
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,

00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:22.572
the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:29.035
the place where anger was an expression

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.783
in the search for love, a place where dysfunction

00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:37.501
is a true reaction to untruth.

00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:41.048
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:44.411
in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,

00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:48.426
and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.

00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:52.166
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply

00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:57.678
that you can define how strong a democracy is

00:14:57.678 --> 00:15:02.911
by how its government treats its child.

00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:04.967
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.

00:15:04.967 --> 00:15:09.934
Thanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)

00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:12.386
(Applause)
