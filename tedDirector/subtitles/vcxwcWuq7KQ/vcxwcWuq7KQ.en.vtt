00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.656
Code is the next universal language.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.856
In the seventies, it was punk music
that drove the whole generation.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.336
In the eighties, it was probably money.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.696
But for my generation of people,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.536
software is the interface
to our imagination and our world.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.256
And that means that we need

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.536
a radically, radically
more diverse set of people

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.336
to build those products,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.296
to not see computers as mechanical
and lonely and boring and magic,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.296
to see them as things
that they can tinker

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.760
and turn around and twist,
and so forth.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.496
My personal journey into the world
of programming and technology

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.496
started at the tender age of 14.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.616
I had this mad teenage crush
on an older man,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.976
and the older man in question
just happened to be

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.416
the then Vice President
of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.496
And I did what every single
teenage girl would want to do.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.736
I wanted to somehow
express all of this love,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.336
so I built him a website, it's over here.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.296
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.576
there was no Facebook,
there was no Pinterest.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.736
So I needed to learn to code

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.136
in order to express
all of this longing and loving.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.496
And that is how programming
started for me.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.056
It started as a means of self-expression.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.696
Just like when I was smaller,
I would use crayons and legos.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.320
And when I was older, I would use
guitar lessons and theater plays.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.896
But then, there were other things
to get excited about,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.336
like poetry and knitting socks

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.656
and conjugating French irregular verbs

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.536
and coming up with make-believe worlds

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.696
and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.616
And I started to be one of those people

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.320
who felt that computers
are boring and technical and lonely.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.936
Here's what I think today.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.016
Little girls don't know that they
are not supposed to like computers.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.296
Little girls are amazing.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.456
They are really, really good
at concentrating on things

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.736
and being exact and they ask
amazing questions like,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.336
"What?" and "Why?"
and "How?" and "What if?"

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.040
And they don't know that they
are not supposed to like computers.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.696
It's the parents who do.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.015
It's us parents who feel

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.136
like computer science
is this esoteric, weird science discipline

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.816
that only belongs to the mystery makers.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.576
That it's almost as far removed
from everyday life

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.136
as, say, nuclear physics.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.616
And they are partly right about that.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.136
There's a lot of syntax
and controls and data structures

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.816
and algorithms and practices,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.416
protocols and paradigms in programming.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.736
And we as a community,
we've made computers smaller and smaller.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.296
We've built layers and layers
of abstraction on top of each other

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.816
between the man and the machine

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.056
to the point that we no longer
have any idea how computers work

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.256
or how to talk to them.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.056
And we do teach our kids
how the human body works,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.176
we teach them how
the combustion engine functions

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.216
and we even tell them
that if you want to really be an astronaut

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.696
you can become one.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.896
But when the kid comes to us and asks,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.656
"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.096
Or, "How does the computer know
what happens when I press 'play,'

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.976
how does it know which video to show?"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.576
Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.320
We adults, we grow oddly silent.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.856
"It's magic," some of us say.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.600
"It's too complicated," the others say.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.016
Well, it's neither.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.616
It's not magic and it's not complicated.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.256
It all just happened
really, really, really fast.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.176
Computer scientists built
these amazing, beautiful machines,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.616
but they made them
very, very foreign to us,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.856
and also the language we speak
to the computers

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.896
so that we don't know
how to speak to the computers anymore

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.416
without our fancy user interfaces.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.016
And that's why no one recognized

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.736
that when I was conjugating
French irregular verbs,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.016
I was actually practicing
my pattern recognition skills.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.336
And when I was excited about knitting,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.896
I actually was following
a sequence of symbolic commands

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.656
that included loops inside of them.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.096
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.096
to find an exact language
between English and mathematics

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.440
found its home inside of a computer.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.280
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.536
The kids of today, they tap, swipe
and pinch their way through the world.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.776
But unless we give them tools
to build with computers,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.736
we are raising only consumers
instead of creators.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.296
This whole quest
led me to this little girl.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.696
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.816
She is completely fearless,
imaginative and a little bit bossy.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.296
And every time
I would run into a problem

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.576
in trying to teach
myself programming like,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.576
"What is object-oriented design
or what is garbage collection?",

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.016
I would try to imagine how a six-year-old
little girl would explain the problem.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.696
And I wrote a book about her
and I illustrated it

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.096
and the things
Ruby taught me go like this.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.576
Ruby taught me that you're
not supposed to be afraid

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.976
of the bugs under your bed.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.056
And even the biggest of the problems

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.576
are a group of tiny problems
stuck together.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.336
And Ruby also introduced
me to her friends,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.256
the colorful side of the Internet culture.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.136
She has friends like the Snow Leopard,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.096
who is beautiful but doesn't want
to play with the other kids.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.736
And she has friends like the green robots
that are really friendly but super messy.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.936
And she has friends like Linux the penguin

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.616
who's really ruthlessly efficient,
but somewhat hard to understand.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.880
And idealistic foxes, and so on.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.536
In Ruby's world, you learn
technology through play.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.776
And, for instance, computers
are really good at repeating stuff,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.696
so the way Ruby would teach
loops goes like this.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.096
This is Ruby's favorite dance move,
it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.616
clap, clap and jump."

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.656
And you learn counter loops
by repeating that four times.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.496
And you learn while loops
by repeating that sequence

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.296
while I'm standing on one leg.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.616
And you learn until loops
by repeating that sequence

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.696
until mom gets really mad.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.736
(Laughter)

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.480
And most of all, you learn
that there are no ready answers.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.056
When coming up with the curriculum
for Ruby's world,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.376
I needed to really ask the kids
how they see the world

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.416
and what kind of questions they have

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.520
and I would organize
play testing sessions.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.920
I would start by showing the kids
these four pictures.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.816
I would show them a picture of a car,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.256
a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.520
And I would ask, "Which one of these
do you think is a computer?"

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.216
And the kids would be
very conservative and go,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.016
"None of these is a computer.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.696
I know what a computer is:

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.056
it's that glowing box

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.696
in front of which mom or dad
spends way too much time."

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.216
But then we would talk

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.056
and we would discover
that actually, a car is a computer,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.456
it has a navigation system inside of it.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.256
And a dog -- a dog
might not be a computer,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.496
but it has a collar

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.136
and the collar might have
a computer inside of it.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.616
And grocery stores, they have
so many different kinds of computers,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.056
like the cashier system
and the burglar alarms.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.416
And kids, you know what?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.976
In Japan, toilets are computers

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.896
and there's even hackers who hack them.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.696
(Laughter)

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.936
And we go further

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.176
and I give them these little stickers
with an on/off button on them.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.816
And I tell the kids,
"Today you have this magic ability

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.456
to make anything in this room
into a computer."

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.816
And again, the kids go,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.736
"Sounds really hard,
I don't know the right answer for this."

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.336
But I tell them, "Don't worry,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.936
your parents don't know
the right answer, either.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.176
They've just started
to hear about this thing

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.416
called The Internet of Things.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.416
But you kids,
you are going to be the ones

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.816
who are really going to live up in a world
where everything is a computer."

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.056
And then I had this little girl
who came to me

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.376
and took a bicycle lamp

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.616
and she said, "This bicycle lamp,
if it were a computer,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.656
it would change colors."

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.696
And I said, "That's a really good idea,
what else could it do?"

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.456
And she thinks and she thinks,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.496
and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp
were a computer,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.256
we could go on a biking trip
with my father

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.896
and we would sleep in a tent

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.760
and this biking lamp
could also be a movie projector."

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.600
And that's the moment I'm looking for,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.976
the moment when the kid realizes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.376
that the world
is definitely not ready yet,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.376
that a really awesome way
of making the world more ready

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.616
is by building technology

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.400
and that each one of us
can be a part of that change.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.256
Final story, we also built a computer.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.016
And we got to know the bossy CPU
and the helpful RAM and ROM

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.456
that help it remember things.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.416
And after we've assembled
our computer together,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.096
we also design an application for it.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.135
And my favorite story is this little boy,

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.416
he's six years old

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.559
and his favorite thing in the world
is to be an astronaut.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.376
And the boy, he has
these huge headphones on

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.656
and he's completely immersed
in his tiny paper computer

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.696
because you see, he's built his own

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.016
intergalactic planetary
navigation application.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.176
And his father, the lone astronaut
in the Martian orbit,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.056
is on the other side of the room

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.696
and the boy's important mission

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.640
is to bring the father
safely back to earth.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.216
And these kids are going to have
a profoundly different view of the world

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.640
and the way we build it with technology.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.696
Finally, the more approachable,
the more inclusive,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.096
and the more diverse
we make the world of technology,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.096
the more colorful and better
the world will look like.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.696
So, imagine with me, for a moment,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.296
a world where the stories we tell

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.336
about how things get made
don't only include

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.776
the twentysomething-year-old
Silicon Valley boys,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.200
but also Kenyan schoolgirls
and Norwegian librarians.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.216
Imagine a world where
the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.456
who live in a permanent
reality of 1s and 0s,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.096
they grow up to be very optimistic
and brave about technology.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.496
They embrace the powers
and the opportunities

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.120
and the limitations of the world.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.816
A world of technology
that is wonderful, whimsical

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.480
and a tiny bit weird.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.616
When I was a girl,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.656
I wanted to be a storyteller.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.256
I loved make-believe worlds

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.896
and my favorite thing to do

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.976
was to wake up in the mornings
in Moominvalley.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.120
In the afternoons,
I would roam around the Tatooines.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.200
And in the evenings,
I would go to sleep in Narnia.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.600
And programming turned out
to be the perfect profession for me.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.656
I still create worlds.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.640
Instead of stories, I do them with code.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.696
Programming gives me this amazing power

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.096
to build my whole little universe

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.080
with its own rules
and paradigms and practices.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.080
Create something out of nothing
with the pure power of logic.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.136
Thank you.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.600
(Applause)
