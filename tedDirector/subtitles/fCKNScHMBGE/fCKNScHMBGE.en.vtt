00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.975
(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan.
In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.809
(English) I was born
in a middle class family.

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:24.479
My father was five years old
when he lost his father,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.312
but by the time I was born,

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:30.161
he was already a businessman.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.748
But it didn't make a difference to him

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:36.680
if his children were going to be
a boy or a girl:

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:38.307
they were going to go to school.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.291
So I guess I was the lucky one.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.934
My mother had 16 pregnancies.

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:50.489
From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.292
You can imagine as a child
what I went through.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.857
Day to day, I watched women

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.627
being carried to a graveyard,

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:06.131
or watched children going to a graveyard.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.579
At that time, when I
finished my high school,

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.982
I really wanted to be a doctor.

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.220
I wanted to be a doctor
to help women and children.

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:20.498
So I completed my education,

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.942
but I wanted to go to university.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.974
Unfortunately, in my country,
there wasn't a dormitory for girls,

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:32.987
so I was accepted in medical school,
but I could not go there.

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:38.297
So as a result, my father
sent me to America.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.908
I came to America.

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:42.982
I completed my education.

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.775
While I was completing my education,

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.926
my country was invaded by Russia.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.382
And do you know that at the time
I was completing my education,

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:58.144
I didn't know what was going on
with my family or with my country.

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:01.565
There were months, years,
I didn't know about it.

00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:05.360
My family was in a refugee camp.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.225
So as soon as I completed my education,

00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:12.829
I brought my family to America.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.626
I wanted them to be safe.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.808
But where was my heart?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.197
My heart was in Afghanistan.

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:23.776
Day after day,
when I listened to the news,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.474
when I followed what was
going on with my country,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:28.069
my heart was breaking up.

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:30.641
I really wanted to go back to my country,

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.783
but at the same time I knew
I could not go there,

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:36.196
because there was no place for me.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:38.347
I had a good job.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.656
I was a professor at a university.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.482
I earned good money.

00:02:42.506 --> 00:02:44.172
I had a good life.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.983
My family was here.

00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:47.998
I could live with them.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:49.880
But I wasn't happy.

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:51.625
I wanted to go back home.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.174
So I went to the refugee camp.

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:58.102
And when I went
to the refugee camp in Pakistan,

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:01.031
there were 7.5 million refugees.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:04.176
7.5 million refugees.

00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:08.993
About 90 percent of them
were women and children.

00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:13.088
Most of the men have been killed
or they were in war.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.317
And you know, in the refugee camp,

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:19.182
when I went day-to-day to do a survey,

00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:23.381
I found things you never could imagine.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:26.849
I saw a widow with five to eight children

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.094
sitting there and weeping

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.991
and not knowing what to do.

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:34.769
I saw a young woman
have no way to go anywhere,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.951
no education, no entertainment,
no place to even live.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:45.514
I saw young men that had lost
their father and their home,

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:50.431
and they are supporting the family
as a 10-to-12-year old boy --

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:52.145
being the head of the household,

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.360
trying to protect their sister
and their mother and their children.

00:03:56.113 --> 00:03:59.152
So it was a very devastating situation.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.104
My heart was beating for my people,

00:04:02.128 --> 00:04:03.795
and I didn't know what to do.

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:07.144
At that moment, we talk about momentum.

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:11.436
At that moment, I felt,
what can I do for these people?

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.604
How could I help these people?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.666
I am one individual.
What can I do for them?

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:19.848
But at that moment, I knew

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:22.419
that education changed my life.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.459
It transformed me. It gave me status.

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:30.114
It gave me confidence.
It gave me a career.

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:32.352
It helped me to support my family,

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:34.831
to bring my family to another country,

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:36.019
to be safe.

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.590
And I knew that at that moment

00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:43.622
that what I should give to my people
is education and health,

00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:45.519
and that's what I went after.

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:48.283
But do you think it was easy?

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:55.227
No, because at that time, education
was banned for girls, completely.

00:04:56.346 --> 00:05:00.034
And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:02.241
people were not trusting anyone.

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:06.780
It was very hard to come and say,
"I want to do this."

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:08.225
Who am I?

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.375
Somebody who comes from the United States.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.297
Somebody who got educated here.

00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:14.995
Did they trust me? Of course not.

00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:19.936
So I really needed to build
the trust in this community.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.801
How am I going to do that?

00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:25.269
I went and surveyed and looked and looked.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.935
I asked.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.221
Finally, I found one man.

00:05:29.674 --> 00:05:31.110
He was 80 years old.

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:32.824
He was a mullah.

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.070
I went to his tent in the camp,

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.046
and I asked him,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.165
"I want to make you a teacher."

00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:42.768
And he looked at me,

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:44.165
and he said, "Crazy woman,

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:49.165
crazy woman, how do you think
I can be a teacher?"

00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:52.395
And I told him,
"I will make you a teacher."

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.848
Finally, he accepted my offer,

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:58.356
and once I started a class
in his compound,

00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:00.848
the word spread all over.

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.799
In a matter of one year,

00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:06.744
we had 25 schools set up,

00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:09.712
15,000 children going to school,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.832
and it was amazing.

00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:14.093
(Applause)

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:15.268
Thank you.

00:06:16.236 --> 00:06:17.387
Thank you.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:23.794
But of course, we're doing all our work,
we were giving teacher training.

00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:28.587
We were training women's rights,
human rights, democracy, rule of law.

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.040
We were giving all kinds of training.

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:33.540
And one day, I tell you,

00:06:34.087 --> 00:06:37.746
one day I was in the office
in Peshawar, Pakistan.

00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:43.466
All of a sudden, I saw my staff
running to rooms and locking the doors

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.443
and telling me, "Run away, hide!"

00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:49.776
And you know, as a leader, what do you do?

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.293
You're scared. You know it's dangerous.

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:56.087
You know your life is on the line.

00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.896
But as a leader,
you have to hold it together.

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:02.007
You have to hold it together
and show strength.

00:07:02.412 --> 00:07:04.618
So I said, "What's going on?"

00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:07.507
And these people were pouring
into my office.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.539
So I invited them to the office.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:14.174
They came, and there were
nine of them -- nine Taliban.

00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:17.475
They were the ugliest looking men
you can ever see.

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.540
(Laughter)

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.562
Very mean-looking people,

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:23.833
black clothes, black turban,

00:07:23.857 --> 00:07:25.593
and they pour into my office.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:29.339
And I invited them
to have a seat and have tea.

00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:32.133
They said no. They are not
going to drink tea.

00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:36.386
And of course, with the tone
of voice they were using,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.806
it was very scary,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.417
but I was really shaking up.

00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:44.020
But also I was strong, holding myself up.

00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:47.354
And, of course, by that time,
you know how I dress --

00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.949
I dress from head to toe in a black hijab.

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:52.456
The only thing you could see, my eyes.

00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:55.918
They asked me, "What are you doing?

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:59.347
Don't you know that school
is banned for girls?

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.514
What are you doing here?"

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:04.523
And you know, I just looked at them,

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:07.142
and I said, "What school?
Where is the school?"

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.308
(Laughter)

00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:13.428
(Applause)

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:17.213
And they look at my face, and they said,
"You are teaching girls here."

00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:20.071
I said, "This is a house of somebody.

00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:22.332
We have some students coming,

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:25.308
and they are all learning
Koran, Holy Book.

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:30.062
And you know, Koran says that
if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.339
they can be a good wife,

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.403
and they can obey their husband."

00:08:34.768 --> 00:08:38.912
(Laughter)

00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:40.753
And I tell you one thing:

00:08:40.777 --> 00:08:43.500
that's the way you work with those people,
and you know --

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:44.975
(Laughter)

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:49.022
So by that time,
they started speaking Pashto.

00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:50.975
They talked to each other,

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:53.689
and they said, "Let's go,
leave her alone, she's OK."

00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:58.808
And you know, this time,
I offered them tea again,

00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:01.490
and they took a sip and they left.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:06.268
By that time, my staff
poured into my office.

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:08.307
They were scared to death.

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:10.402
They didn't know why they didn't kill me.

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.863
They didn't know why
they didn't take me away.

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:15.625
But everybody was happy to see me.

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:19.157
Very happy, and I was happy
to be alive, of course.

00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:20.332
(Laughter)

00:09:20.356 --> 00:09:22.370
Of course, I was happy to be alive.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:28.270
But also, as we continuously gave
training during the fall of the Taliban --

00:09:28.294 --> 00:09:30.731
of course during the Taliban
there is another story.

00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:34.914
We went underground and we provided
education for 80 schoolgirls,

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:38.461
3,000 students underground,
and continuously we trained.

00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:41.719
With the fall of the Taliban,
we went into the country,

00:09:41.743 --> 00:09:44.203
and we opened school after school.

00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:46.632
We opened women's learning center.

00:09:46.656 --> 00:09:48.592
We continuously opened clinics.

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:50.600
We worked with mothers and children.

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.347
We had reproductive health training.

00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:55.187
We had all kinds of training
that you can imagine.

00:09:55.489 --> 00:09:59.758
I was very happy. I was delighted
with the outcome of my work.

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:03.414
And one day, with four trainers
and one bodyguard,

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:06.207
I was going up north of Kabul,

00:10:06.692 --> 00:10:08.612
and all of a sudden, again,

00:10:09.239 --> 00:10:11.517
I was stopped in the middle of the road

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:13.432
by 19 young men.

00:10:13.836 --> 00:10:16.479
Rifles on their shoulders,
they blocked the road.

00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:20.551
And I told my driver, "What's going on?"

00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:22.298
And the driver said, "I don't know."

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:25.091
He asked them. They said,
"We have nothing to do with you."

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:28.122
They called my name.
They said, "We want her."

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.731
My bodyguard got out, said,
"I can answer you.

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:33.049
What do you want?"

00:10:33.073 --> 00:10:35.080
They said, "Nothing." They called my name.

00:10:35.104 --> 00:10:39.975
And by that time, the women
are yelling and screaming inside the car.

00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:42.554
I am very shaken up,
and I told myself, this is it.

00:10:42.578 --> 00:10:45.095
This time, we all are going to be killed.

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:47.419
There is no doubt in my mind.

00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:52.633
But still, the moment comes,
and you take strength

00:10:52.657 --> 00:10:55.531
from whatever you believe
and whatever you do.

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:56.920
It's in your heart.

00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:59.819
You believe in your worth,
and you can walk on it.

00:10:59.843 --> 00:11:03.382
So I just hold myself
on the side of the car.

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:06.961
My leg was shaking, and I got outside.

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:09.485
And I asked them, "What can I do for you?"

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:11.096
You know what they said to me?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.262
They said, "We know who you are.

00:11:14.286 --> 00:11:16.208
We know where you are going.

00:11:16.232 --> 00:11:18.913
Every day you go up north here and there.

00:11:18.937 --> 00:11:21.985
You train women, you teach them

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:25.056
and also you give them an
opportunity to have a job.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.880
You build their skills. How about us?"

00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:30.755
(Laughter)

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:33.747
(Applause)

00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:38.135
"And you know, how about us?

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.745
What are we going to do?"

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:42.141
I looked at them, and I said,
"I don't know."

00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:44.983
(Laughter)

00:11:45.007 --> 00:11:46.578
They said, "It's OK.

00:11:46.602 --> 00:11:48.762
The only thing we can do, what we know,

00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.865
from the time we're born,
we just hold the gun and kill.

00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:53.165
That's all we know."

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.182
And you know what that means.

00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:57.093
It's a trap to me, of course.

00:11:57.522 --> 00:12:00.975
So I walk out of there.
They said, "We'll let you go, go."

00:12:01.435 --> 00:12:04.339
And so I walked into the car,
I sit in the car,

00:12:04.363 --> 00:12:07.633
and I told the driver,
"Turn around and go back to the office."

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:11.412
At that time, we only
were supporting girls.

00:12:11.436 --> 00:12:14.897
We only had money for women to train them,

00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.539
to send them to school, and nothing else.

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:20.412
By the time I came to the office,

00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:22.975
of course my trainers were gone.

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:25.969
They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.

00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:28.914
My bodyguard was the only one there,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.096
and my voice was completely gone.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.255
I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:37.287
and I said, "What am I going to do?"

00:12:37.827 --> 00:12:40.303
How am I going to solve this problem?

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:43.731
Because we had training
going on up north already.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.707
Hundreds of women were there
coming to get training.

00:12:48.295 --> 00:12:52.048
So I was sitting there,
all of a sudden, at this moment,

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.025
talking about momentum, we are,

00:12:54.501 --> 00:12:56.382
at that moment,

00:12:56.406 --> 00:13:00.374
one of my wonderful donors
called me about a report.

00:13:01.207 --> 00:13:04.740
And she asked me, "Sakena?"
And I answered her.

00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:07.112
She said, "It's not you.
What's wrong with you?"

00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:09.755
I said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.

00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:13.317
No matter what I tried to do,
she didn't believe me,

00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:14.992
and she asked me again.

00:13:15.016 --> 00:13:16.858
"OK, tell me what's going on?"

00:13:16.882 --> 00:13:18.920
I told her the whole story.

00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:23.595
At that time, she said, "OK,
you go next time, and you will help them.

00:13:24.222 --> 00:13:25.833
You will help them."

00:13:26.142 --> 00:13:29.817
And when, two days later,
I went the same route,

00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:32.857
and do you know, they were not in here,

00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.054
they were a little back further,

00:13:35.078 --> 00:13:39.627
the same young men, standing up there
and holding the rifle

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:41.957
and pointing to us to stop the car.

00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:43.705
So we stopped the car.

00:13:43.729 --> 00:13:46.609
I got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me."

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:48.277
And they said, "Yes."

00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:52.729
I said, "On one condition,
that whatever I say, you accept it."

00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:54.625
And they said, yes, they do.

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:56.522
So I took them to the mosque,

00:13:56.863 --> 00:13:59.652
and to make a long story short,

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:02.422
I told them I'd give them teachers.

00:14:02.763 --> 00:14:06.715
Today, they are the best trainers.

00:14:06.739 --> 00:14:08.398
They learn English,

00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:10.858
they learn how to be teachers,

00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:12.620
they learn computers,

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.494
and they are my guides.

00:14:14.518 --> 00:14:18.355
Every area that is unknown to us
in the mountain areas,

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.626
they go with me.
They are ahead, and we go.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.307
And they protect us.

00:14:23.275 --> 00:14:24.426
And --

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.601
(Applause)

00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:26.776
Thank you.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.306
(Applause)

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.489
That tells you that education
transforms people.

00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:37.647
When you educate people,

00:14:37.671 --> 00:14:39.639
they are going to be different,

00:14:39.663 --> 00:14:41.346
and today all over,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.742
we need to work for gender equality.

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:47.472
We cannot only train women
but forget about the men,

00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:52.950
because the men are the real people
who are giving women the hardest time.

00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:54.553
(Laughter)

00:14:54.577 --> 00:14:58.338
So we started training men
because the men should know

00:14:58.362 --> 00:14:59.829
the potential of women,

00:14:59.853 --> 00:15:02.354
know how much these potential men has,

00:15:02.378 --> 00:15:06.973
and how much these women
can do the same job they are doing.

00:15:06.997 --> 00:15:10.377
So we are continuously giving
training to men,

00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:13.687
and I really believe strongly.

00:15:13.711 --> 00:15:16.831
I live in a country
that was a beautiful country.

00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:18.673
I just want to share this with you.

00:15:19.006 --> 00:15:20.824
It was a beautiful country,

00:15:20.848 --> 00:15:22.879
beautiful, peaceful country.

00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:25.228
We were going everywhere.

00:15:25.252 --> 00:15:27.325
Women were getting education:

00:15:27.349 --> 00:15:29.736
lawyer, engineer, teacher,

00:15:30.205 --> 00:15:32.372
and we were going from house to house.

00:15:32.396 --> 00:15:34.270
We never locked our doors.

00:15:34.912 --> 00:15:36.874
But you know what happened to my country.

00:15:36.898 --> 00:15:42.714
Today, people cannot walk
out of their door without security issues.

00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:48.230
But we want the same
Afghanistan we had before.

00:15:48.254 --> 00:15:50.198
And I want to tell you the other side.

00:15:50.222 --> 00:15:53.777
Today, the women of Afghanistan
are working very, very hard.

00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:58.626
They are earning degrees.
They are training to be lawyers.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.880
They are training to be
doctors, back again.

00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:02.554
They are training to be teachers,

00:16:02.578 --> 00:16:04.562
and they are running businesses.

00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:07.365
So it is so wonderful

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:11.792
to see people like that
reach their complete potential,

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:14.387
and all of this is going to happen.

00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:16.554
I want to share this with you,

00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:17.982
because of love,

00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:20.085
because of compassion,

00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:23.196
and because of trust and honesty.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.638
If you have these few things with you,

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:28.678
you will accomplish.

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:32.566
We have one poet, Mawlānā Rūmī.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.400
He said that by having compassion

00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:40.647
and having love,
you can conquer the world.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:42.241
And I tell you, we could.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:44.526
And if we could do it in Afghanistan,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.892
I am sure 100 percent that everyone
can do it in any part of the world.

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:50.655
Thank you very, very much.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:53.524
(Applause)

00:16:53.548 --> 00:16:58.975
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:02.238
(Applause)
