00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:14.807
In June of 1998,

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:20.147
Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head,
North Carolina for France.

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:22.469
That's her boat, the American Pearl.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.913
It's 23 feet long and just six feet across

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:26.881
at its widest point.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.873
The deck was the size of a cargo bed
of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:34.357
Tori and her friends built it by hand,

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:37.051
and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.414
Her plan was to row it alone

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.364
across the Atlantic Ocean --

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:43.500
no motor, no sail --

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.262
something no woman and no American
had ever done before.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.841
This would be her route:

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:53.068
over 3,600 miles across
the open North Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:55.683
Professionally, Tori worked
as a project administrator

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:57.478
for the city of Louisville, Kentucky,

00:00:57.478 --> 00:00:59.289
her hometown,

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.704
but her real passion was exploring.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:04.188
This was not her first big expedition.

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:08.554
Several years earlier, she'd become
the first woman to ski to the South Pole.

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.783
She was an accomplished rower in college,

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:14.265
even competed for a spot
on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:18.189
but this, this was different.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.830
(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure:
Hi. It's Sunday, July 5.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.711
Sector time 9 a.m.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.892
So that's Kentucky time now.

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:32.237
Dawn Landes: Tori made
these videos as she rowed.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.536
This is her 21st day at sea.

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:37.299
At this point, she'd covered
over 1,000 miles,

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.969
had had no radio contact
in more than two weeks

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.409
following a storm that disabled
all her long-range communications systems

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.123
just five days in.

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.144
Most days looked like this.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:50.905
At this point, she'd rowed
over 200,000 strokes,

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.227
fighting the current and the wind.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:56.710
Some days, she traveled
as little as 15 feet.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.219
Yeah.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.866
And as frustrating as those days were,

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.908
other days were like this.

00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:07.019
(Video) TMM: And I want to show you
my little friends.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:11.930
DL: She saw fish, dolphins,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.461
whales, sharks,

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.340
and even some sea turtles.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.615
After two weeks with no human contact,

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.937
Tori was able to contact
a local cargo ship

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.863
via VHF radio.

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:28.648
(Video) TMM: Do you guys
have a weather report, over?

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.782
Man: Heading up to a low

00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:34.267
ahead of you but it's heading,

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.147
and you're obviously going northeast

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:38.051
and there's a high behind us.

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:39.909
That'd be coming

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.416
east-northeast also.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.019
TMM: Good.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.925
DL: She's pretty happy to talk
to another human at this point.

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.367
(Video) TMM: So weather report
says nothing dramatic

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.980
is going to happen soon.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.991
DL: What the weather report
didn't tell her

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.089
was that she was rowing right into
the path of Hurricane Danielle

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:02.187
in the worst hurricane season
on record in the North Atlantic.

00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:07.133
(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.848
There's a very strong wind
from the east now.

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:13.286
It's blowing about.

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:16.165
It's blowing!

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.859
After 12 days of storm

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.693
I get to row for four hours

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:22.837
without a flagging wind.

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:24.527
I'm not very happy right now.

00:03:24.527 --> 00:03:26.196
As happy as I was this morning,

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:30.050
I am unhappy now, so ...

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.195
DL: After nearly three months at sea,

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:36.888
she'd covered over 3,000 miles.

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:38.908
She was two thirds of the way there,

00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:42.438
but in the storm, the waves were
the size of a seven-story building.

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:44.614
Her boat kept capsizing.

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:47.818
Some of them were pitchpole capsizes,
flipping her end over end,

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:50.303
and rowing became impossible.

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:52.536
(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:57.060
I'm in something big, bad and ugly.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.660
Two capsizes.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.477
Last capsize, I took the rib
off the top of my ceiling with my back.

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:11.839
I've had about six capsizes now.

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.346
The last one was a pitchpole.

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:17.295
I have the Argus beacon with me.

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:19.083
I would set off the distress signal,

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:23.309
but quite frankly, I don't think they'd
ever be able to find this little boat.

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.120
It's so far underwater right now,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.299
the only part that's showing
pretty much is the cabin.

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:32.434
It's about 10 a.m.

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:35.127
I've lost track of the number of capsizes.

00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:38.169
I seem to capsize about
every 15 minutes.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.582
I think I may have broken my left arm.

00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:46.667
The waves

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.024
are tearing the boat to shreds.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.042
I keep praying because

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.550
I'm not sure I'm going
to make it through this.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.447
DL: Tori set off her distress beacon

00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:00.341
and was rescued
by a passing container ship.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:04.325
They found her abandoned boat
two months later adrift near France.

00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:07.506
I read about it in the newspaper.

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:11.779
In 1998, I was a high school student
living in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.333
Now, I live in New York City.
I'm a songwriter.

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.630
And her bravery stuck with me,
and I'm adapting her story

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.252
into a musical called "Row."

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.639
When Tori returned home,

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.473
she was feeling disheartened,

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:29.667
she was broke.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.956
She was having a hard time
making the transition

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.115
back into civilization.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.718
In this scene, she sits at home.

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:40.965
The phone is ringing,
her friends are calling,

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.171
but she doesn't know how to talk to them.

00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:46.166
She sings this song.
It's called "Dear Heart."

00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:49.522
(Guitar)

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.046
When I was dreaming,

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:59.297
I took my body

00:05:59.297 --> 00:06:02.617
to beautiful places

00:06:02.617 --> 00:06:05.937
I'd never been.

00:06:05.937 --> 00:06:09.211
I saw Gibraltar,

00:06:09.211 --> 00:06:12.601
and stars of Kentucky

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.875
burned in the moonlight,

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.451
making me smile.

00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:22.714
And when I awoke here,

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:26.161
the sky was so cloudy.

00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:29.534
I walked to a party

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:32.995
where people I know

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:36.222
try hard to know me

00:06:36.222 --> 00:06:39.426
and ask where I've been,

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:42.514
but I can't explain

00:06:42.514 --> 00:06:46.369
what I've seen to them.

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:53.242
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:56.359
Just pay attention,

00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:00.395
go right from the start.

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:06.313
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:09.052
You can fall off the map,

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:13.532
but don't fall apart.

00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:15.377
Ooh ooh ooh,

00:07:15.377 --> 00:07:20.245
ah ah ah ah ah.

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:23.589
Ah ah,

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.421
ah ah ah.

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.630
When I was out there,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.020
the ocean would hold me,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.364
rock me and throw me,

00:07:36.364 --> 00:07:39.684
light as a child.

00:07:39.684 --> 00:07:43.121
But now I'm so heavy,

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.325
nothing consoles me.

00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:49.761
My mind floats like driftwood,

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.035
wayward and wild.

00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:59.582
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:07:59.582 --> 00:08:02.717
Just pay attention,

00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:06.456
go right from the start.

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:12.748
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:16.208
You can fall off the map,

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:20.132
but don't fall apart.

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:24.334
Ooh.

00:08:26.912 --> 00:08:30.139
Eventually, Tori starts to get
her feet under her.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.600
She starts hanging out
with her friends again.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.478
She meets a guy and falls
in love for the first time.

00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:39.543
She gets a new job working
for another Louisville native,

00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:41.818
Muhammad Ali.

00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:44.558
One day, at lunch with her new boss,

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:46.926
Tori shares the news
that two other women

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.689
are setting out to row
across the mid-Atlantic,

00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:53.381
to do something that she
almost died trying to do.

00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:56.502
His response was classic Ali:

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.418
"You don't want to go through life

00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:02.175
as the woman who almost
rowed across the ocean."

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.172
He was right.

00:09:04.172 --> 00:09:05.890
Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.678
and in December of 1999,

00:09:07.678 --> 00:09:09.954
she did it.

00:09:09.954 --> 00:09:12.995
(Applause)
(Guitar)

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:19.404
Thank you.

00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:22.305
(Applause)
