00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:17.315
When I was 14 years old,
I was interested in science --

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.824
fascinated by it,
excited to learn about it.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:24.538
And I had a high school science teacher
who would say to the class,

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.751
"The girls don't have to listen to this."

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.205
Encouraging, yes.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.316
(Laughter)

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.372
I chose not to listen --
but to that statement alone.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.417
So let me take you
to the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.970
500 kilometers, 300 miles
northeast of Santiago.

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:49.474
It's very remote, it's very dry
and it's very beautiful.

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:51.462
And there's not much there.

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:54.126
There are condors, there are tarantulas,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.647
and at night, when the light dims,

00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.036
it reveals one of the darkest
skies on Earth.

00:01:00.906 --> 00:01:03.456
It's kind of a magic place, the mountain.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.817
It's a wonderful combination
of very remote mountaintop

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:11.022
with exquisitely sophisticated technology.

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:15.100
And our ancestors, for as long
as there's been recorded history,

00:01:15.124 --> 00:01:19.910
have looked at the night sky
and pondered the nature of our existence.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:22.866
And we're no exception, our generation.

00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:26.632
The only difficulty is
that the night sky now is blocked

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:28.506
by the glare of city lights.

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:32.672
And so astronomers go
to these very remote mountaintops

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.616
to view and to study the cosmos.

00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:38.100
So telescopes
are our window to the cosmos.

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:44.065
It's no exaggeration to say that
the Southern Hemisphere is going to be

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:47.504
the future of astronomy
for the 21st century.

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:51.367
We have an array
of existing telescopes already,

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:53.423
in the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:58.584
and that's soon to be joined by a really
sensational array of new capability.

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:01.807
There will be two international groups
that are going to be building

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:07.307
giant telescopes, sensitive
to optical radiation, as our eyes are.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.540
There will be a survey telescope

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:12.884
that will be scanning the sky
every few nights.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.892
There will be radio telescopes,

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:18.424
sensitive to long-wavelength
radio radiation.

00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:21.563
And then there will be
telescopes in space.

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:24.484
There'll be a successor
to the Hubble Space Telescope;

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:26.545
it's called the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.054
and it will be launched in 2018.

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:30.784
There'll be a satellite called TESS

00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:34.181
that will discover planets
outside of our solar system.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.889
For the last decade,
I've been leading a group --

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:41.130
a consortium -- international group,

00:02:41.154 --> 00:02:44.137
to build what will be, when it's finished,

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.465
the largest optical
telescope in existence.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.145
It's called the Giant
Magellan Telescope, or GMT.

00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:56.481
This telescope is going to have mirrors
that are 8.4 meters in diameter --

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:57.667
each of the mirrors.

00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:59.330
That's almost 27 feet.

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:03.826
So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe
out to the fourth row in this audience.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.874
Each of the seven mirrors
in this telescope

00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:10.682
will be almost 27 feet in diameter.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:14.634
Together, the seven mirrors
in this telescope will comprise

00:03:14.658 --> 00:03:16.699
80 feet in diameter.

00:03:16.723 --> 00:03:19.681
So, essentially the size
of this entire auditorium.

00:03:20.448 --> 00:03:24.094
The whole telescope will stand
about 43 meters high,

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:26.808
and again, being in Rio,

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:30.451
some of you have been to see
the statue of the giant Christ.

00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:32.304
The scale is comparable in height;

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:35.565
in fact, it's smaller
than this telescope will be.

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:39.280
It's comparable to the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:43.770
And it's going to be housed
in an enclosure that's 22 stories --

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:45.693
60 meters high.

00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:48.719
But it's an unusual building
to protect this telescope.

00:03:48.743 --> 00:03:50.529
It will have open windows to the sky,

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:52.901
be able to point and look at the sky,

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:55.553
and it will actually rotate on a base --

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:59.052
2,000 tons of rotating building.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.552
The Giant Magellan Telescope
will have 10 times the resolution

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.315
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:10.994
It will be 20 million times
more sensitive than the human eye.

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:17.729
And it may, for the first time ever,
be capable of finding life on planets

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:19.763
outside of our solar system.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.842
It's going to allow us to look back
at the first light in the universe --

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:27.233
literally, the dawn of the cosmos.

00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:29.025
The cosmic dawn.

00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:33.517
It's a telescope that's
going to allow us to peer back,

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.326
witness galaxies as they were
when they were actually assembling,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.691
the first black holes in the universe,
the first galaxies.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.298
Now, for thousands of years,
we have been studying the cosmos,

00:04:46.322 --> 00:04:48.976
we've been wondering
about our place in the universe.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.665
The ancient Greeks told us

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.171
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:56.821
Five hundred years ago,
Copernicus displaced the Earth,

00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:59.636
and put the Sun
at the heart of the cosmos.

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:02.839
And as we've learned over the centuries,

00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:05.581
since Galileo Galilei,
the Italian scientist,

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:10.855
first turned, in that time, a two-inch,
very small telescope, to the sky,

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.894
every time we have built
larger telescopes,

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:16.117
we have learned something
about the universe;

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.967
we've made discoveries, without exception.

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.645
We've learned in the 20th century
that the universe is expanding

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.393
and that our own solar system
is not at the center of that expansion.

00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:35.036
We know now that the universe
is made of about 100 billion galaxies

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.710
that are visible to us,

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:42.145
and each one of those galaxies
has 100 billion stars within it.

00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:46.096
So we're looking now
at the deepest image of the cosmos

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.619
that's ever been taken.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.833
It was taken using
the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:55.747
and by pointing the telescope at what
was previously a blank region of sky,

00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:57.370
before the launch of Hubble.

00:05:57.394 --> 00:05:59.657
And if you can imagine this tiny area,

00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:03.011
it's only one-fiftieth
of the size of the full moon.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:05.075
So, if you can imagine the full moon.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.237
And there are now 10,000 galaxies
visible within that image.

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:14.460
And the faintness of those images
and the tiny size is only a result

00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:18.891
of the fact that those galaxies
are so far away, the vast distances.

00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:21.848
And each of those galaxies
may contain within it

00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:26.881
a few billion or even hundreds
of billions of individual stars.

00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.610
Telescopes are like time machines.

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:34.097
So the farther back we look in space,
the further back we see in time.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.656
And they're like light buckets --
literally, they collect light.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.914
So larger the bucket,
the larger the mirror we have,

00:06:40.938 --> 00:06:44.348
the more light we can see,
and the farther back we can view.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.881
So, we've learned in the last century

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:50.839
that there are exotic objects
in the universe -- black holes.

00:06:50.863 --> 00:06:53.640
We've even learned
that there's dark matter and dark energy

00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:54.875
that we can't see.

00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:58.776
So you're looking now
at an actual image of dark matter.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.950
(Laughter)

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:02.617
You got it. Not all audiences get that.

00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:04.406
(Laughter)

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.154
So the way we infer
the presence of dark matter --

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:11.873
we can't see it -- but there's
an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:16.680
We now can look out,
we see this sea of galaxies

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:18.481
in a universe that's expanding.

00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:22.165
What I do myself is to measure
the expansion of the universe,

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.330
and one of the projects
that I carried out in the 1990s

00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:30.470
used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure
how fast the universe is expanding.

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:35.322
We can now trace back to 14 billion years.

00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:40.067
We've learned over time
that stars have individual histories;

00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:43.020
that is, they have birth,
they have middle ages

00:07:43.044 --> 00:07:45.374
and some of them
even have dramatic deaths.

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:51.944
So the embers from those stars actually
then form the new stars that we see,

00:07:51.968 --> 00:07:55.779
most of which turn out to have
planets going around them.

00:07:56.272 --> 00:08:00.307
And one of the really surprising results
in the last 20 years

00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:04.457
has been the discovery
of other planets going around other stars.

00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:06.387
These are called exoplanets.

00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:11.407
And until 1995, we didn't even know
the existence of any other planets,

00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:13.765
other than going around our own sun.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.781
But now, there are almost 2,000
other planets orbiting other stars

00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:23.365
that we can now detect,
measure masses for.

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:27.061
There are 500 of those
that are multiple-planet systems.

00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:31.045
And there are 4,000 --
and still counting -- other candidates

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:33.283
for planets orbiting other stars.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.763
They come in a bewildering variety
of different kinds.

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:40.420
There are Jupiter-like
planets that are hot,

00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:44.702
there are other planets that are icy,
there are water worlds

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:47.980
and there are rocky planets
like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"

00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:52.691
and there have even been planets
that have been speculated diamond worlds.

00:08:53.794 --> 00:08:58.749
So we know there's at least one planet,
our own Earth, in which there is life.

00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:02.933
We've even found planets
that are orbiting two stars.

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:06.138
That's no longer the province
of science fiction.

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:09.425
So around our own planet,
we know there's life,

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:15.165
we've developed a complex life,
we now can question our own origins.

00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:19.948
And given all that we've discovered,
the overwhelming numbers now suggest

00:09:19.972 --> 00:09:24.044
that there may be millions, perhaps --
maybe even hundreds of millions --

00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:26.847
of other [planets]
that are close enough --

00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:30.161
just the right distance from their stars
that they're orbiting --

00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:35.721
to have the existence of liquid water
and maybe could potentially support life.

00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.295
So we marvel now at those odds,
the overwhelming odds,

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:43.262
and the amazing thing
is that within the next decade,

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:48.516
the GMT may be able to take spectra
of the atmospheres of those planets,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.052
and determine whether or not
they have the potential for life.

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:55.482
So, what is the GMT project?

00:09:55.506 --> 00:09:57.380
It's an international project.

00:09:57.404 --> 00:10:03.253
It includes Australia, South Korea,
and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,

00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:06.312
that the newest partner
in our telescope is Brazil.

00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:11.284
(Applause)

00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:16.098
It also includes a number of institutions
across the United States,

00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:19.218
including Harvard University,

00:10:19.242 --> 00:10:22.186
the Smithsonian
and the Carnegie Institutions,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:28.677
and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,
Texas-Austin and Texas A&amp;M University.

00:10:29.074 --> 00:10:30.961
It also involves Chile.

00:10:32.723 --> 00:10:35.935
So, the making of the mirrors
in this telescope is also fascinating

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.324
in its own right.

00:10:37.348 --> 00:10:41.983
Take chunks of glass, melt them
in a furnace that is itself rotating.

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.842
This happens underneath
the football stadium

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:46.908
at the University of Arizona.

00:10:46.932 --> 00:10:49.868
It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.

00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:51.293
Nobody know it's happening.

00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:55.062
And there's essentially
a rotating cauldron.

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:58.121
The mirrors are cast
and they're cooled very slowly,

00:10:58.145 --> 00:11:01.058
and then they're polished
to an exquisite precision.

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:04.714
And so, if you think
about the precision of these mirrors,

00:11:04.738 --> 00:11:09.291
the bumps on the mirror,
over the entire 27 feet,

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:12.994
amount to less
than one-millionth of an inch.

00:11:13.018 --> 00:11:14.542
So, can you visualize that?

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:16.240
Ow!

00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:17.588
(Laughter)

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:23.883
That's one five-thousandths
of the width of one of my hairs,

00:11:23.907 --> 00:11:26.044
over this entire 27 feet.

00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:27.938
It's a spectacular achievement.

00:11:27.962 --> 00:11:31.277
It's what allows us to have
the precision that we will have.

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:35.293
So, what does that precision buy us?

00:11:35.843 --> 00:11:38.582
So the GMT, if you can imagine --

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:43.055
if I were to hold up a coin,
which I just happen to have,

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:48.070
and I look at the face of that coin,
I can see from here

00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:52.079
the writing on the coin;
I can see the face on that coin.

00:11:52.103 --> 00:11:55.217
My guess that even in the front row,
you can't see that.

00:11:55.645 --> 00:11:58.507
But if we were to turn
the Giant Magellan Telescope,

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:01.904
all 80-feet diameter
that we see in this auditorium,

00:12:01.928 --> 00:12:04.997
and point it 200 miles away,

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:10.889
if I were standing in São Paulo,
we could resolve the face of this coin.

00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:14.520
That's the extraordinary resolution
and power of this telescope.

00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:18.459
And if we were --

00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:22.353
(Applause)

00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:26.978
If an astronaut went up to the Moon,
a quarter of a million miles away,

00:12:27.002 --> 00:12:29.918
and lit a candle -- a single candle --

00:12:29.942 --> 00:12:32.752
then we would be able
to detect it, using the GMT.

00:12:33.347 --> 00:12:34.629
Quite extraordinary.

00:12:37.334 --> 00:12:43.015
This is a simulated image
of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:45.624
"Nearby" is astronomical,
it's all relative.

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:48.151
It's tens of millions of light-years away.

00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:50.189
This is what this cluster would look like.

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:52.381
So look at those four bright objects,

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:56.412
and now lets compare it with a camera
on the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:59.615
You can see faint detail
that starts to come through.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:05.934
And now finally -- and look how dramatic
this is -- this is what the GMT will see.

00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.328
So, keep your eyes on those
bright images again.

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:12.770
This is what we see on one of the most
powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,

00:13:12.794 --> 00:13:15.675
and this, again, what the GMT will see.

00:13:16.554 --> 00:13:18.412
Extraordinary precision.

00:13:18.975 --> 00:13:20.297
So, where are we?

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:23.503
We have now leveled the top
of the mountaintop in Chile.

00:13:23.527 --> 00:13:25.290
We blasted that off.

00:13:25.314 --> 00:13:28.033
We've tested and polished
the first mirror.

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:30.646
We've cast the second
and the third mirrors.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.939
And we're about to cast the fourth mirror.

00:13:32.963 --> 00:13:34.850
We had a series of reviews this year,

00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:37.416
international panels
that came in and reviewed us,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.971
and said, "You're ready
to go to construction."

00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:43.344
And so we plan on building this telescope
with the first four mirrors.

00:13:43.368 --> 00:13:47.497
We want to get on the air quickly,
and be taking science data --

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:52.100
what we astronomers call
"first light," in 2021.

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:56.477
And the full telescope will be finished
in the middle of the next decade,

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:57.897
with all seven mirrors.

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:02.100
So we're now poised to look back
at the distant universe,

00:14:02.124 --> 00:14:03.432
the cosmic dawn.

00:14:03.804 --> 00:14:07.937
We'll be able to study other planets
in exquisite detail.

00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:12.161
But for me, one of the most
exciting things about building the GMT

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.015
is the opportunity
to actually discover something

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:18.309
that we don't know about --
that we can't even imagine at this point,

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:19.975
something completely new.

00:14:20.713 --> 00:14:24.343
And my hope is that with the construction
of this and other facilities,

00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:29.577
that many young women and men
will be inspired to reach for the stars.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.308
Thank you very much.

00:14:31.332 --> 00:14:32.807
Obrigado.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:38.724
(Applause)

00:14:38.748 --> 00:14:40.350
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.

00:14:40.374 --> 00:14:42.641
Stay with me, because
I have a question for you.

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:45.062
You mentioned different facilities.

00:14:45.086 --> 00:14:49.939
So the Magellan Telescope is going up,
but also ALMA and others in Chile

00:14:49.963 --> 00:14:52.099
and elsewhere, including in Hawaii.

00:14:52.772 --> 00:14:56.848
Is it about cooperation
and complementarity, or about competition?

00:14:56.872 --> 00:15:00.594
I know there's competition in terms
of funding, but what about the science?

00:15:00.618 --> 00:15:03.835
Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science,
they're very complementary.

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:06.886
The telescopes that are in space,
the telescopes on the ground,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.340
telescopes with different
wavelength capability,

00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:12.307
telescopes even that are similar,
but different instruments --

00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:16.077
they will all look at different parts
of the questions that we're asking.

00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:19.728
So when we discover other planets,
we'll be able to test those observations,

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.840
we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:24.739
be able to look in space
with very high resolution.

00:15:24.763 --> 00:15:26.240
So, they're very complementary.

00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:28.501
You're right about
the funding, we compete;

00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:31.190
but scientifically,
it's very complementary.

00:15:31.214 --> 00:15:33.867
BG: Wendy, thank you very much
for coming to TEDGlobal.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.042
WF: Thank you.

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:36.754
(Applause)
