00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.521
Recently, I flew over a crowd

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.906
of thousands of people in Brazil

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:25.539
playing music by George Frideric Handel.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.543
I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:31.918
again playing music by this same composer.

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:34.685
Let's take a look.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:43.265
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.960
(Video) Daria van den Bercken: I
live there on the third floor.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.849
(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.457
I actually live there, around the corner.

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:01.133
and you'd be really welcome.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.952
Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun?
Child: (In Dutch) Yes!

00:01:03.952 --> 00:01:07.739
[(In Dutch) "Handel house concert"]

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:34.636
(Applause)

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:42.154
Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real

00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:45.810
magical experience for hundreds of reasons.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.330
Now you may ask, why have I done these things?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.692
They're not really typical for a musician's

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:52.913
day-to-day life.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:56.463
Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music

00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:59.545
and I wanted to share it with as many people

00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:01.829
as possible.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.944
It started a couple of years ago.

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:07.375
I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.497
and browsing the Internet a little,

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:12.320
when I found out that Handel had written works

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
for the keyboard.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.637
Well, I was surprised. I did not know this.

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:21.020
So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.920
And what happened next was

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.491
that I entered this state of pure,

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.360
unprejudiced amazement.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.700
It was an experience

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.827
of being totally in awe of the music,

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:38.607
and I had not felt that in a long time.

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:42.760
It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.051
The first piece that I played through

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:48.840
started like this.

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:55.792
(Music)

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.680
Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.714
And I turned the page and what came next

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:23.672
was this.

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:27.392
(Music)

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:54.690
Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.390
So within a couple of minutes,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.550
and the piece isn't even finished yet,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.645
I experienced two very contrasting characters:

00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:07.267
beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.337
And I consider these two elements to be

00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:12.140
vital human expressions.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.815
And the purity of the music makes you hear it

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:18.247
very effectively.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.233
I've given a lot of children's concerts

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:25.371
for children of seven and eight years old,

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:29.185
and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.760
even Stockhausen,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.752
or some jazzy music,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.901
they are open to hear it,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.188
really willing to listen,

00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:40.716
and they are comfortable doing so.

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:42.250
And when classes come in

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.699
with children who are just a few years older,

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.547
11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:52.640
in reaching them like that.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.307
The complexity of the music does become an issue,

00:04:56.307 --> 00:05:00.140
and actually the opinions of others —

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.823
parents, friends, media — they start to count.

00:05:04.823 --> 00:05:07.331
But the young ones, they don't question

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.672
their own opinion.

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:13.664
They are in this constant state of wonder,

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:17.354
and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening

00:05:17.354 --> 00:05:19.638
like these seven-year-old children,

00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:22.112
even when growing up.

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:24.261
And that is why I have played

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:26.601
not only in the concert hall

00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:30.930
but also on the street, online, in the air:

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.497
to feel that state of wonder,

00:05:33.497 --> 00:05:35.679
to truly listen,

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.223
and to listen without prejudice.

00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:41.349
And I would like to invite you

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.382
to do so now.

00:05:50.862 --> 00:05:57.830
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Chaconne in G Major."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:23.960
(Applause)

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.906
Thank you.

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:29.400
(Applause)
