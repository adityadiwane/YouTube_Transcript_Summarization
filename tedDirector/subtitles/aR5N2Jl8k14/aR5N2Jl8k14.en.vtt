00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.844
How many of you are creatives,

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:18.492
designers, engineers,
entrepreneurs, artists,

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.903
or maybe you just have
a really big imagination?

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:22.775
Show of hands? (Cheers)

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:23.980
That's most of you.

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:27.448
I have some news for us creatives.

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:31.107
Over the course of the next 20 years,

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:36.264
more will change around
the way we do our work

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.359
than has happened in the last 2,000.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:44.959
In fact, I think we're at the dawn
of a new age in human history.

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:50.226
Now, there have been four major historical
eras defined by the way we work.

00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:54.499
The Hunter-Gatherer Age
lasted several million years.

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:58.559
And then the Agricultural Age
lasted several thousand years.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.505
The Industrial Age lasted
a couple of centuries.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.816
And now the Information Age
has lasted just a few decades.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
And now today, we're on the cusp
of our next great era as a species.

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.796
Welcome to the Augmented Age.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.513
In this new era, your natural human
capabilities are going to be augmented

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.605
by computational systems
that help you think,

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:24.815
robotic systems that help you make,

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:26.487
and a digital nervous system

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.201
that connects you to the world
far beyond your natural senses.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.199
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.

00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:35.423
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:38.603
(Laughter)

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:41.448
I would actually argue
that we're already augmented.

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:43.612
Imagine you're at a party,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.156
and somebody asks you a question
that you don't know the answer to.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.940
If you have one of these,
in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.988
But this is just a primitive beginning.

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:58.014
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.861
In fact, for the last
three-and-a-half million years,

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:04.994
the tools that we've had
have been completely passive.

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:09.678
They do exactly what we tell them
and nothing more.

00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:12.803
Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:16.682
The chisel only carves
where the artist points it.

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:22.804
And even our most advanced tools
do nothing without our explicit direction.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:26.009
In fact, to date, and this
is something that frustrates me,

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.481
we've always been limited

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:31.006
by this need to manually
push our wills into our tools --

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.327
like, manual,
literally using our hands,

00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.779
even with computers.

00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:38.355
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.229
(Laughter)

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.399
I want to have a conversation
with a computer.

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:45.393
I want to say, "Computer,
let's design a car,"

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:46.956
and the computer shows me a car.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.588
And I say, "No, more fast-looking,
and less German,"

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:51.775
and bang, the computer shows me an option.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.664
(Laughter)

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:56.334
That conversation might be
a little ways off,

00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:59.023
probably less than many of us think,

00:02:59.047 --> 00:03:00.810
but right now,

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:01.985
we're working on it.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.042
Tools are making this leap
from being passive to being generative.

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:09.959
Generative design tools
use a computer and algorithms

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.591
to synthesize geometry

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:15.369
to come up with new designs
all by themselves.

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:18.564
All it needs are your goals
and your constraints.

00:03:18.588 --> 00:03:19.996
I'll give you an example.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.808
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:25.458
all you would need to do
is tell it something like,

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:26.755
it has four propellers,

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.910
you want it to be
as lightweight as possible,

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:31.204
and you need it to be
aerodynamically efficient.

00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:36.142
Then what the computer does
is it explores the entire solution space:

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:40.093
every single possibility that solves
and meets your criteria --

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:41.559
millions of them.

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:43.558
It takes big computers to do this.

00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.537
But it comes back to us with designs

00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:48.704
that we, by ourselves,
never could've imagined.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:52.058
And the computer's coming up
with this stuff all by itself --

00:03:52.082 --> 00:03:53.760
no one ever drew anything,

00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:55.870
and it started completely from scratch.

00:03:56.858 --> 00:03:59.245
And by the way, it's no accident

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.750
that the drone body looks just like
the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:05.114
(Laughter)

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.162
It's because the algorithms
are designed to work

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:09.823
the same way evolution does.

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.195
What's exciting is we're starting
to see this technology

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.378
out in the real world.

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:16.854
We've been working with Airbus
for a couple of years

00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:18.787
on this concept plane for the future.

00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.881
It's a ways out still.

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:24.685
But just recently we used
a generative-design AI

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:26.516
to come up with this.

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:32.582
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
that's been designed by a computer.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.430
It's stronger than the original
yet half the weight,

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.600
and it will be flying
in the Airbus A320 later this year.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.784
So computers can now generate;

00:04:40.808 --> 00:04:45.403
they can come up with their own solutions
to our well-defined problems.

00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.807
But they're not intuitive.

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.917
They still have to start from scratch
every single time,

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.506
and that's because they never learn.

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:55.954
Unlike Maggie.

00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:57.559
(Laughter)

00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:00.880
Maggie's actually smarter
than our most advanced design tools.

00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:02.727
What do I mean by that?

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:04.341
If her owner picks up that leash,

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:06.433
Maggie knows with a fair
degree of certainty

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.861
it's time to go for a walk.

00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:09.070
And how did she learn?

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:12.418
Well, every time the owner picked up
the leash, they went for a walk.

00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:14.320
And Maggie did three things:

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.213
she had to pay attention,

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:18.319
she had to remember what happened

00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:22.360
and she had to retain and create
a pattern in her mind.

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.344
Interestingly, that's exactly what

00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:27.891
computer scientists
have been trying to get AIs to do

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:29.774
for the last 60 or so years.

00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:31.852
Back in 1952,

00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:35.677
they built this computer
that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:38.061
Big deal.

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.849
Then 45 years later, in 1997,

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:44.345
Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:50.834
2011, Watson beats these two
humans at Jeopardy,

00:05:50.858 --> 00:05:53.786
which is much harder for a computer
to play than chess is.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.622
In fact, rather than working
from predefined recipes,

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.969
Watson had to use reasoning
to overcome his human opponents.

00:06:02.213 --> 00:06:04.652
And then a couple of weeks ago,

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:08.938
DeepMind's AlphaGo beats
the world's best human at Go,

00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:11.174
which is the most difficult
game that we have.

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:14.094
In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves

00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:16.142
than there are atoms in the universe.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.856
So in order to win,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.498
what AlphaGo had to do
was develop intuition.

00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:27.028
And in fact, at some points,
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:29.338
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:32.931
And things are moving really fast.

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:36.182
I mean, consider --
in the space of a human lifetime,

00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:38.439
computers have gone from a child's game

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.788
to what's recognized as the pinnacle
of strategic thought.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.236
What's basically happening

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.570
is computers are going
from being like Spock

00:06:49.594 --> 00:06:51.543
to being a lot more like Kirk.

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:55.185
(Laughter)

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:58.633
Right? From pure logic to intuition.

00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:01.747
Would you cross this bridge?

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:04.752
Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!"

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:06.084
(Laughter)

00:07:06.108 --> 00:07:08.765
And you arrived at that decision
in a split second.

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.217
You just sort of knew
that bridge was unsafe.

00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:13.230
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:16.822
that our deep-learning systems
are starting to develop right now.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:19.249
Very soon, you'll literally be able

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:21.479
to show something you've made,
you've designed,

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:22.656
to a computer,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.169
and it will look at it and say,

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:27.016
"Sorry, homie, that'll never work.
You have to try again."

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.744
Or you could ask it if people
are going to like your next song,

00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:33.656
or your next flavor of ice cream.

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:37.948
Or, much more importantly,

00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:40.336
you could work with a computer
to solve a problem

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.997
that we've never faced before.

00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.422
For instance, climate change.

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:45.466
We're not doing a very
good job on our own,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.735
we could certainly use
all the help we can get.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.217
That's what I'm talking about,

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:51.796
technology amplifying
our cognitive abilities

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.372
so we can imagine and design things
that were simply out of our reach

00:07:55.396 --> 00:07:57.955
as plain old un-augmented humans.

00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:02.745
So what about making
all of this crazy new stuff

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:05.210
that we're going to invent and design?

00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:09.865
I think the era of human augmentation
is as much about the physical world

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.954
as it is about the virtual,
intellectual realm.

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.574
How will technology augment us?

00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:18.554
In the physical world, robotic systems.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.176
OK, there's certainly a fear

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.688
that robots are going to take
jobs away from humans,

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.542
and that is true in certain sectors.

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:28.872
But I'm much more interested in this idea

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:33.906
that humans and robots working together
are going to augment each other,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.988
and start to inhabit a new space.

00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:38.374
This is our applied research lab
in San Francisco,

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:41.540
where one of our areas of focus
is advanced robotics,

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:44.075
specifically, human-robot collaboration.

00:08:44.854 --> 00:08:47.613
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.

00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:49.426
As an experiment, we set it up

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.910
to help a person working in construction
doing repetitive tasks --

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:57.998
tasks like cutting out holes for outlets
or light switches in drywall.

00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:00.488
(Laughter)

00:09:01.697 --> 00:09:04.808
So, Bishop's human partner
can tell what to do in plain English

00:09:04.832 --> 00:09:06.137
and with simple gestures,

00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:07.608
kind of like talking to a dog,

00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:09.775
and then Bishop executes
on those instructions

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.691
with perfect precision.

00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:14.704
We're using the human
for what the human is good at:

00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:17.061
awareness, perception and decision making.

00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:19.325
And we're using the robot
for what it's good at:

00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:21.097
precision and repetitiveness.

00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:24.439
Here's another cool project
that Bishop worked on.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.538
The goal of this project,
which we called the HIVE,

00:09:27.562 --> 00:09:31.413
was to prototype the experience
of humans, computers and robots

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:34.657
all working together to solve
a highly complex design problem.

00:09:35.613 --> 00:09:37.064
The humans acted as labor.

00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:40.561
They cruised around the construction site,
they manipulated the bamboo --

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:43.341
which, by the way,
because it's a non-isomorphic material,

00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:45.239
is super hard for robots to deal with.

00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:47.285
But then the robots
did this fiber winding,

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:49.760
which was almost impossible
for a human to do.

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:53.405
And then we had an AI
that was controlling everything.

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:56.719
It was telling the humans what to do,
telling the robots what to do

00:09:56.743 --> 00:09:59.658
and keeping track of thousands
of individual components.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.862
What's interesting is,

00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:04.027
building this pavilion
was simply not possible

00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.575
without human, robot and AI
augmenting each other.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.030
OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy.

00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:17.522
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist
Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:20.424
to generatively design
and robotically print

00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:23.443
the world's first autonomously
manufactured bridge.

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:27.820
So, Joris and an AI are designing
this thing right now, as we speak,

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:29.016
in Amsterdam.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.361
And when they're done,
we're going to hit "Go,"

00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:34.696
and robots will start 3D printing
in stainless steel,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.003
and then they're going to keep printing,
without human intervention,

00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:39.585
until the bridge is finished.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:43.847
So, as computers are going
to augment our ability

00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:46.021
to imagine and design new stuff,

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.940
robotic systems are going to help us
build and make things

00:10:48.964 --> 00:10:51.048
that we've never been able to make before.

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.327
But what about our ability
to sense and control these things?

00:10:56.351 --> 00:11:00.382
What about a nervous system
for the things that we make?

00:11:00.406 --> 00:11:02.918
Our nervous system,
the human nervous system,

00:11:02.942 --> 00:11:05.253
tells us everything
that's going on around us.

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:09.690
But the nervous system of the things
we make is rudimentary at best.

00:11:09.714 --> 00:11:13.277
For instance, a car doesn't tell
the city's public works department

00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:16.431
that it just hit a pothole at the corner
of Broadway and Morrison.

00:11:16.455 --> 00:11:18.487
A building doesn't tell its designers

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.195
whether or not the people inside
like being there,

00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:24.229
and the toy manufacturer doesn't know

00:11:24.253 --> 00:11:26.260
if a toy is actually being played with --

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:28.823
how and where and whether
or not it's any fun.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.254
Look, I'm sure that the designers
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie

00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:34.502
when they designed her.

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:35.973
(Laughter)

00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:38.903
But what if it turns out that Barbie's
actually really lonely?

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:42.074
(Laughter)

00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:44.374
If the designers had known

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:46.505
what was really happening
in the real world

00:11:46.529 --> 00:11:49.112
with their designs -- the road,
the building, Barbie --

00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:51.830
they could've used that knowledge
to create an experience

00:11:51.854 --> 00:11:53.254
that was better for the user.

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:55.069
What's missing is a nervous system

00:11:55.093 --> 00:11:58.802
connecting us to all of the things
that we design, make and use.

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:03.290
What if all of you had that kind
of information flowing to you

00:12:03.314 --> 00:12:05.497
from the things you create
in the real world?

00:12:07.252 --> 00:12:08.703
With all of the stuff we make,

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.162
we spend a tremendous amount
of money and energy --

00:12:11.186 --> 00:12:13.562
in fact, last year,
about two trillion dollars --

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:16.440
convincing people to buy
the things we've made.

00:12:16.464 --> 00:12:19.852
But if you had this connection
to the things that you design and create

00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:21.603
after they're out in the real world,

00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:25.241
after they've been sold
or launched or whatever,

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.885
we could actually change that,

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:29.956
and go from making people want our stuff,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.414
to just making stuff that people
want in the first place.

00:12:33.438 --> 00:12:36.225
The good news is, we're working
on digital nervous systems

00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:39.050
that connect us to the things we design.

00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:41.812
We're working on one project

00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:45.548
with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles
called the Bandito Brothers

00:12:45.572 --> 00:12:46.979
and their team.

00:12:47.003 --> 00:12:50.436
And one of the things these guys do
is build insane cars

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.333
that do absolutely insane things.

00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:56.175
These guys are crazy --

00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:57.235
(Laughter)

00:12:57.259 --> 00:12:58.662
in the best way.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.576
And what we're doing with them

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.040
is taking a traditional race-car chassis

00:13:05.064 --> 00:13:06.649
and giving it a nervous system.

00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:09.731
So we instrumented it
with dozens of sensors,

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.390
put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:15.771
took it out to the desert
and drove the hell out of it for a week.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.286
And the car's nervous system
captured everything

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.792
that was happening to the car.

00:13:19.816 --> 00:13:22.437
We captured four billion data points;

00:13:22.461 --> 00:13:24.771
all of the forces
that it was subjected to.

00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:26.454
And then we did something crazy.

00:13:27.088 --> 00:13:28.588
We took all of that data,

00:13:28.612 --> 00:13:32.348
and plugged it into a generative-design AI
we call "Dreamcatcher."

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.054
So what do get when you give
a design tool a nervous system,

00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:39.960
and you ask it to build you
the ultimate car chassis?

00:13:40.543 --> 00:13:42.516
You get this.

00:13:44.113 --> 00:13:47.826
This is something that a human
could never have designed.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.415
Except a human did design this,

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:54.748
but it was a human that was augmented
by a generative-design AI,

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.003
a digital nervous system

00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:59.032
and robots that can actually
fabricate something like this.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.095
So if this is the future,
the Augmented Age,

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:07.380
and we're going to be augmented
cognitively, physically and perceptually,

00:14:07.404 --> 00:14:08.812
what will that look like?

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:12.717
What is this wonderland going to be like?

00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:14.450
I think we're going to see a world

00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:17.542
where we're moving
from things that are fabricated

00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:19.011
to things that are farmed.

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:23.432
Where we're moving from things
that are constructed

00:14:23.456 --> 00:14:25.160
to that which is grown.

00:14:25.954 --> 00:14:28.142
We're going to move from being isolated

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:29.776
to being connected.

00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:32.865
And we'll move away from extraction

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:34.762
to embrace aggregation.

00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:39.554
I also think we'll shift
from craving obedience from our things

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.219
to valuing autonomy.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.235
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.636
our world is going to change dramatically.

00:14:47.396 --> 00:14:50.642
We're going to have a world
with more variety, more connectedness,

00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.953
more dynamism, more complexity,

00:14:52.977 --> 00:14:55.295
more adaptability and, of course,

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:56.536
more beauty.

00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:58.615
The shape of things to come

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.929
will be unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:15:00.953 --> 00:15:02.112
Why?

00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:05.891
Because what will be shaping those things
is this new partnership

00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:09.585
between technology, nature and humanity.

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:14.903
That, to me, is a future
well worth looking forward to.

00:15:14.927 --> 00:15:16.198
Thank you all so much.

00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:21.891
(Applause)
