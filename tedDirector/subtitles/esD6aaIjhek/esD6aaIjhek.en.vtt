00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.396
Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.716
how we define them

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.996
and how they, almost as revenge,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.276
define us.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.356
The English language
is a magnificent sponge.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.036
I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.636
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.100
which is the hunger for disaster.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.116
You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.426
and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.836
In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" --

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.876
I'm not pronouncing that correctly --

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.596
which means the longing
to feel intensely again

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.620
the way you did when you were a kid.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.636
In Polish, they have a word "jouska"

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.196
which is the kind of
hypothetical conversation

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.340
that you compulsively
play out in your head.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.356
And finally, in German,
of course in German,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.236
they have a word called "zielschmerz"

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.676
which is the dread
of getting what you want.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.796
(Laughter)

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.780
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.916
I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.556
Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.236
as I go about my day,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.396
but I'm really glad they exist.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.156
But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.796
I am the author of "The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.916
which I've been writing
for the last seven years.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.956
And the whole mission of the project

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.156
is to find holes
in the language of emotion

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.396
and try to fill them

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.316
so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.756
and quirks of the human condition

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.756
that we all feel
but may not think to talk about

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.476
because we don't have the words to do it.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.916
And about halfway through this project,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.556
I defined "sonder,"

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.956
the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.636
and everyone else is just extras.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.356
But in reality,
we're all the main character,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.459
and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.076
And so as soon as I published that,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.796
I got a lot of response from people

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.436
saying, "Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.476
but there was no word for that."

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.260
So it made them feel less alone.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.780
That's the power of words,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.460
to make us feel less alone.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.956
And it was not long after that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.756
that I started to notice sonder

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.076
being used earnestly
in conversations online,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.996
and not long after I actually noticed it,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.516
I caught it next to me
in an actual conversation in person.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.996
There is no stranger feeling
than making up a word

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.316
and then seeing it
take on a mind of its own.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.436
I don't have a word
for that yet, but I will.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.876
(Laughter)

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.100
I'm working on it.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.100
I started to think
about what makes words real,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.876
because a lot of people ask me,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.236
the most common thing
I got from people is,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.516
"Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.596
And I didn't really know what to tell them

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.556
because once sonder started to take off,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.260
who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.036
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.516
as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.556
we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.676
and just sort of get on with things.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.260
But once you realize that people --

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.876
that this world was built
by people no smarter than you,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.996
then you can reach out
and touch those walls

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.716
and even put your hand through them

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.100
and realize that you have
the power to change it.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.556
And when people ask me,
"Are these words real?"

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.676
I had a variety of answers
that I tried out.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.836
Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.436
But one of them I tried out was,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.996
"Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.236
The way that this path is real
because people wanted it to be there.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.956
(Laughter)

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.076
It happens on college
campuses all the time.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.436
It's called a "desire path."

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.476
(Laughter)

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.836
But then I decided,
what people are really asking

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.756
when they're asking if a word is real,
they're really asking,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.099
"Well, how many brains
will this give me access to?"

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.636
Because I think that's
a lot of how we look at language.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.436
A word is essentially a key

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.436
that gets us into certain people's heads.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.900
And if it gets us into one brain,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.996
it's not really worth it,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.276
not really worth knowing.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.756
Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.980
A million brains, OK, now we're talking.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.076
And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.356
That's what makes it worth knowing.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.196
Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.436
[O.K.]

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.676
That's it.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.956
The realest word we have.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.556
That is the closest thing we have
to a master key.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.156
That's the most commonly
understood word in the world,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.436
no matter where you are.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.676
The problem with that is,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.396
no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.716
(Laughter)

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.796
Which is kind of weird, right?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.276
I mean, it could be a misspelling
of "all correct," I guess,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.556
or "old kinderhook."

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.436
No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.956
says something about
how we add meaning to words.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.780
The meaning is not
in the words themselves.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.500
We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.020
And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.716
and searching for the meaning of life,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.980
I think words have
something to do with that.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.636
And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.660
the dictionary is a decent place to start.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.956
It brings a sense of order

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.740
to a very chaotic universe.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.540
Our view of things is so limited

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.156
that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.476
and try to figure out
a way to interpret it

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.340
and be able to get on with our day.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.340
We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.260
I think a lot of us feel boxed in

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.716
by how we use these words.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.076
We forget that words are made up.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.460
It's not just my words.
All words are made up,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.780
but not all of them mean something.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.796
We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.556
that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.196
and so I think I feel us drifting apart
a little more every year,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.300
the more seriously we take words.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.500
Because remember, words are not real.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.460
They don't have meaning. We do.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.100
And I'd like to leave you with a reading

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.196
from one of my favorite philosophers,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.756
Bill Watterson, who created
"Calvin and Hobbes."

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.980
He said,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.676
"Creating a life that reflects
your values and satisfies your soul

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.356
is a rare achievement.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.836
To invent your own life's meaning

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.396
is not easy,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.236
but it is still allowed,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.460
and I think you'll be
happier for the trouble."

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.356
Thank you.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.100
(Applause)
