00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
We're here to celebrate compassion.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
But compassion, from my vantage point,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
has a problem.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
As essential as it is across our traditions,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
as real as so many of us know it to be

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
in particular lives,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and it is suspect in my field of journalism.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
or it's seen as potentially depressing.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
of giving a speech in Holland

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and, after the fact, the word "compassion"

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
was translated as "pity."

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Now compassion, when it enters the news,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
too often comes in the form

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
of feel-good feature pieces

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
or sidebars about heroic people

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
you could never be like

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
or happy endings

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
or examples of self-sacrifice

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that would seem to be too good to be true

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
most of the time.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Our cultural imagination about compassion

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
has been deadened by idealistic images.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And so what I'd like to do this morning

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
for the next few minutes

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
is perform a linguistic resurrection.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that words matter,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
that they shape the way we understand ourselves,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
the way we interpret the world

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and the way we treat others.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
When this country

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
first encountered genuine diversity

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in the 1960s,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
we adopted tolerance

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
as the core civic virtue

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
with which we would approach that.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
connotes "allowing," "indulging"

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and "enduring."

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
In the medical context that it comes from,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
it is about testing the limits of thriving

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in an unfavorable environment.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue;

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
it's more of a cerebral ascent.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And it's too cerebral

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to animate guts and hearts

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and behavior

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
when the going gets rough.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And the going is pretty rough right now.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
I think that without perhaps being able to name it,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
we are collectively experiencing

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that we've come as far as we can

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Compassion is a worthy successor.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It is organic,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and yet it transcends them.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
that could change us if we truly let it sink into

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
the standards to which we hold ourselves and others,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
both in our private and in our civic spaces.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
So what is it, three-dimensionally?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
What are its kindred and component parts?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
To start simply,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I want to say that compassion is kind.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
But kindness is an everyday byproduct

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
of all the great virtues.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And it is a most edifying form

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
of instant gratification.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Compassion is also curious.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I love a phrase that was offered me

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
by two young women

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
They are working to create a new imagination

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
about shared life among young Jews and Muslims,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and as they do that, they cultivate what they call

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
"curiosity without assumptions."

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
It can be joined with the harder work

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
of forgiveness and reconciliation,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
but it can also express itself

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
in the simple act of presence.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
It's linked to practical virtues

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
like generosity and hospitality

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and just being there,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
just showing up.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
I think that compassion

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
also is often linked to beauty --

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and by that I mean a willingness

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to see beauty in the other,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
not just what it is about them

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
that might need helping.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
often speak of beauty as a core moral value.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And in that light, for the religious,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
compassion also brings us

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
into the territory of mystery --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
encouraging us not just

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
to see beauty,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
but perhaps also to look for the face of God

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
in the moment of suffering,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
in the face of a stranger,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
in the face of the vibrant religious other.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I'm not sure if I can show you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
what tolerance looks like,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
but I can show you what compassion looks like --

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
because it is visible.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
When we see it, we recognize it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and it changes the way we think about what is doable,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
what is possible.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It is so important

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
when we're communicating big ideas --

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
to root it as we present it to others

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
in space and time and flesh and blood --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
the color and complexity of life.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And compassion does seek physicality.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
I first started to learn this most vividly

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
from Matthew Sanford.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And I don't imagine that you will realize this

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
when you look at this photograph of him,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
but he's paraplegic.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and -- and he does experience this as an "and"

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
rather than a "but" --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and he experiences himself

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
to be healed and whole.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And as a teacher of yoga,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
he brings that experience to others

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
across the spectrum of ability and disability,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
health, illness and aging.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
He says that he's just at an extreme end

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
of the spectrum we're all on.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
He's doing some amazing work now

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
But he says that he has yet to experience someone

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
who became more aware of their body,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
in all its frailty and its grace,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
without, at the same time,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
becoming more compassionate towards all of life.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Compassion also looks like this.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This is Jean Vanier.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
which you can now find all over the world,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
communities centered around life

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
with people with mental disabilities --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
mostly Down syndrome.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
The communities that Jean Vanier founded,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
like Jean Vanier himself,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
exude tenderness.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
"Tender" is another word

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
I would love to spend some time resurrecting.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
We spend so much time in this culture

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
being driven and aggressive,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and I spend a lot of time being those things too.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
And compassion can also have those qualities.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But again and again, lived compassion

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Jean Vanier says

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
that his work,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
like the work of other people --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
is never in the first instance about changing the world;

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
He's says that what they do with L'Arche

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
is not a solution, but a sign.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Compassion is rarely a solution,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
but it is always a sign of a deeper reality,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
of deeper human possibilities.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And compassion is unleashed

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
in wider and wider circles

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
by signs and stories,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
never by statistics and strategies.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
We need those things too,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
but we're also bumping up against their limits.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And at the same time that we are doing that,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I think we are rediscovering the power of story --

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that as human beings, we need stories

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to survive, to flourish,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
to change.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Our traditions have always known this,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and carried them forward in time for us.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
There is, of course, a story

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
behind the key moral longing

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and commandment of Judaism

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
to repair the world -- tikkun olam.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And I'll never forget hearing that story

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
that in the beginning of the Creation

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
something happened

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and the original light of the universe

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
was shattered into countless pieces.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
It lodged as shards

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
inside every aspect of the Creation.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And that the highest human calling

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
to gather it up,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and in so doing, to repair the world.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Rachel Naomi Remen says

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
this is an important and empowering story

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
for our time,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
because this story insists

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
that each and every one of us,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
frail and flawed as we may be,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
inadequate as we may feel,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
has exactly what's needed

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
to help repair the part of the world

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
that we can see and touch.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Stories like this,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
signs like this,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
are practical tools

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.260
in a world longing to bring compassion

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
to abundant images of suffering

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
that can otherwise overwhelm us.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Rachel Naomi Remen

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
is actually bringing compassion

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
back to its rightful place alongside science

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
in her field of medicine

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
in the training of new doctors.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And this trend

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
how these kinds of virtues

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
the work Fred Luskin is doing --

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I think this is one of the most fascinating developments

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
of the 21st century --

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that science, in fact,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
is taking a virtue like compassion

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
definitively out of the realm of idealism.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
This is going to change science, I believe,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and it will change religion.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
But here's a face

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
from 20th century science

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
that might surprise you

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
in a discussion about compassion.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
We all know about the Albert Einstein

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
who came up with E = mc2.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
We don't hear so much about the Einstein

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
because the best hotel there

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
was segregated and wouldn't have her.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
to advocate for political prisoners in Europe

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
or the Scottsboro boys

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
in the American South.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Einstein believed deeply

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
that science should transcend

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
national and ethnic divisions.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
But he watched physicists and chemists

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
in the early 20th century.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
He once said that science in his generation

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
had become like a razor blade

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
in the hands of a three-year-old.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And Einstein foresaw

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that as we grow more modern

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and technologically advanced,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
we need the virtues

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
our traditions carry forward in time

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
more, not less.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Some of his favorites were Moses,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And Einstein said --

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and I think this is a quote,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
again, that has not been passed down in his legacy --

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
that "these kinds of people

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
are geniuses in the art of living,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
more necessary

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
to the dignity, security and joy of humanity

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
than the discoverers of objective knowledge."

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Now invoking Einstein

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
but actually it is.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
I want to show you

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
the rest of this photograph,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
because this photograph

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture --

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
we clean it up

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and we diminish its depths and its grounding

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
in life, which is messy.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
So in this photograph

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
you see a mind looking out a window

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
This is the full photograph,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
smoking a cigar.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And by the look of that paunch,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
he hasn't been doing enough yoga.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and someone said, "When I look at the first photo,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
I ask myself, what was he thinking?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And when I look at the second, I ask,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Well, he was complicated.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
He was incredibly compassionate

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
in some of his relationships

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and terribly inadequate in others.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
And it is much harder, often,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
to be compassionate towards those closest to us,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
which is another quality in the universe of compassion,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
on its dark side,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
that also deserves our serious attention and illumination.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
So was Mother Teresa.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
So are we all.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And I want to say

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that it is a liberating thing

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion --

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
following on what Fred Luskin says --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
that these flaws just make us human.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Our culture is obsessed with perfection

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and with hiding problems.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
But what a liberating thing to realize

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
that our problems, in fact,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
are probably our richest sources

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.260
for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
towards bringing compassion

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
towards the suffering and joys of others.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Einstein became a humanitarian,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
not because of his exquisite knowledge

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
of space and time and matter,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that it was some of your very wounding experiences

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
in a religious life that,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
with a zigzag,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
have led to the Charter for Compassion.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
any more than it can be reduced to pity.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
So I want to propose

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
a final definition of compassion --

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way --

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and that would be for us

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
to call compassion a spiritual technology.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Now our traditions contain

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
vast wisdom about this,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
and we need them to mine it for us now.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
But compassion is also equally at home

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
in the secular as in the religious.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and say that humanity,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
the future of humanity,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
needs this technology

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
as much as it needs all the others

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
that have now connected us

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and set before us

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
the terrifying and wondrous possibility

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
of actually becoming one human race.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Thank you.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
(Applause)
