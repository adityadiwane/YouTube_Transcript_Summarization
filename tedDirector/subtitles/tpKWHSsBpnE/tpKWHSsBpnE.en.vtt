00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
and how it can be solved.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330
I'd like to start with a little experiment.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.330
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
or you've had laser refractive surgery?

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.330
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.330
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.330
because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
that have some sort of vision correction.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.330
The World Health Organization estimates --

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses --

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
the lowest estimate is 150 million people.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
They also have an estimate of around a billion.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.330
which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
is around half of any population.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.330
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
it's also an educational problem,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.330
and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.330
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
that we have in the developed world.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
There are just way too few eye care professionals.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and that's the ratio in the U.K.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.330
where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.330
How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
I came up with a solution to this problem,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
and that solves the problem.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.330
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.330
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.330
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
and I can see that guy running out there.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
Next step in my process.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.330
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
... I've just ...

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.330
(Applause)

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
In fact, this technology's been evolving.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
I started working on it in 1985,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
and it's been evolving very slowly.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
There are about 30,000 in use now.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.330
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
I have a global vision for vision.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And that vision is to try to get a billion people

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.330
wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
The technology is being further developed --

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
the cost has to be brought down.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.330
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
But the cost has to be brought right down.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
who live on a dollar a day.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
How do you solve this problem?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
You start to get into detail.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.330
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
How do you deal with the industry?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.330
And the answer to that is research.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.330
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
here in the university.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
