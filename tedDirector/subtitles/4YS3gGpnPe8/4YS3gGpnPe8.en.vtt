00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The story I wanted to share with you today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is my challenge as an Iranian artist,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
as an Iranian woman artist,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
as an Iranian woman artist

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
living in exile.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
On the dark side,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is political.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Politics have defined our lives.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
If you're living in Iran,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
you're facing censorship, harassment,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
arrest, torture --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
at times, execution.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
If you're living outside like me,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
you're faced with life in exile --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
the pain of the longing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and the separation from your loved ones

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and your family.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Therefore, we don't find

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
the moral, emotional,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
psychological and political space

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to distance ourselves from the reality

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
of social responsibility.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Oddly enough,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
an artist such as myself

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
finds herself also in the position of being the voice,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
the speaker of my people,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
even if I have, indeed,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
no access to my own country.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Also, people like myself,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
we're fighting two battles on different grounds.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
We're being critical of the West,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
the perception of the West

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
about our identity --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
about the image that is constructed about us,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
about our women, about our politics,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
about our religion.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
We are there to take pride

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and insist on respect.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And at the same time,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
we're fighting another battle.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
That is our regime,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
our government --

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
our atrocious government,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
[that] has done every crime

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
in order to stay in power.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Our artists are at risk.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
We are in a position of danger.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
We pose a threat

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
to the order of the government.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
But ironically,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
this situation

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
has empowered all of us,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
because we are considered, as artists,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
central to the cultural, political,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
social discourse in Iran.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
We are there to inspire, to provoke,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to mobilize,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
to bring hope to our people.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
We are the reporters of our people,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and are communicators

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
to the outside world.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Art is our weapon.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Culture is a form of resistance.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I envy sometimes the artists of the West

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
for their freedom of expression.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
For the fact that they can distance themselves

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
from the question of politics.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
From the fact that they are only serving one audience,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
mainly the Western culture.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But also, I worry about the West,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
because often in this country,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
in this Western world that we have,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
culture risks being a form of entertainment.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Our people depend on our artists,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and culture is beyond communication.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
My journey as an artist

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
started from a very, very personal place.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I did not start

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to make social commentary

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
about my country.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
The first one that you see in front of you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
is actually when I first returned to Iran

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
after being separated for a good 12 years.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
It was after the Islamic Revolution

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
of 1979.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
While I was absent from Iran,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and had entirely transformed the country

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
from Persian to the Islamic culture.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I came mainly to be reunited with my family

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and to reconnect in a way

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that I found my place in the society.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
But instead, I found a country

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that was totally ideological

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and that I didn't recognize anymore.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
More so, I became very interested,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
as I was facing

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
my own personal dilemmas and questions,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I became immersed in the study

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
of the Islamic Revolution --

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
how, indeed,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
it had incredibly transformed

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
the lives of Iranian women.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I found the subject of Iranian women

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
immensely interesting,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
in the way the women of Iran, historically,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
seemed to embody the political transformation.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
So in a way, by studying a woman,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So I made a group of work

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
that at once faced my own personal questions in life,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
the subject of martyrdom,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
of love of God, faith,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
but violence and crime and cruelty.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
For me, this became incredibly important.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I was an outsider

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
who had come back to Iran to find my place,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
but I was not in a position

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
to be critical of the government

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
This changed slowly

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
as I found my voice

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and I discovered things

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
that I didn't know I would discover.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So my art became slightly more critical.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
My knife became a little sharper.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And I fell into a life in exile.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
I am a nomadic artist.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Now I am making films.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Last year, I finished a film

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
called "Women Without Men."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
"Women Without Men" returns to history,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
but another part of our Iranian history.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
It goes to 1953

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
when American CIA exercised a coup

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and removed a democratically elected leader,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Dr. Mossadegh.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
The book is written by an Iranian woman,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Shahrnush Parsipur.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
It's a magical realist novel.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
This book is banned,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and she spent five years in prison.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
My obsession with this book,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and the reason I made this into a film,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
is because it at once was addressing

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
the question of being a female --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
traditionally, historically in Iran --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and the question of four women

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
who are all looking for an idea

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
of change, freedom and democracy --

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
also struggled for an idea

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
of freedom and democracy

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and independence from the foreign interventions.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
I made this film

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
because I felt it's important

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
for it to speak to the Westerners

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
about our history as a country.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
That all of you seem to remember Iran

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
after the Islamic Revolution.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
That Iran was once a secular society,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and we had democracy,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and this democracy was stolen from us

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
by the American government,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
by the British government.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
This film also speaks to the Iranian people

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
in asking them to return to their history

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
in the way we looked, in the way we played music,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
in the way we had intellectual life.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And most of all,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
in the way that we fought for democracy.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
These are some of the shots actually from my film.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
These are some of the images of the coup.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And we made this film in Casablanca,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
recreating all the shots.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
This film tried to find a balance

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
between telling a political story,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
but also a feminine story.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Being a visual artist, indeed,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
I am foremost interested to make art --

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to make art that transcends

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
politics, religion,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
the question of feminism,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and become an important, timeless,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
universal work of art.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
The challenge I have

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
is how to do that.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
How to move you with your emotions,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
but also make your mind work.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
These are some of the images

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
and the characters of the film.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Now comes the green movement --

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
the summer of 2009,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
as my film is released --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
What is unbelievably ironic

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
is the period that we tried to depict in the film,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
the cry for democracy

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and social justice,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
repeats itself now

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
again in Tehran.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
The green movement

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
significantly inspired the world.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
who stand for basic human rights

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
and struggle for democracy.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
What was most significant for me

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
was, once again,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
the presence of the women.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
They're absolutely inspirational for me.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
If in the Islamic Revolution,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
the images of the woman portrayed

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
were submissive

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and didn't have a voice,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
now we saw a new idea of feminism

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
in the streets of Tehran --

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
women who were educated,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
forward thinking, non-traditional,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
sexually open, fearless

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and seriously feminist.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
These women and those young men

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
united Iranians

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
across the world, inside and outside.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
I then discovered

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
why I take so much inspiration

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
from Iranian women.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
That, under all circumstances,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
they have pushed the boundary.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
They have confronted the authority.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
They have broken every rule

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
in the smallest and the biggest way.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And once again, they proved themselves.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
I stand here to say

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that Iranian women have found a new voice,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and their voice is giving me my voice.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And it's a great honor

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.260
even if I have to operate in the West only for now.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Thank you so much.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:38.260
(Applause)
