00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi, my name is Frank,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and I collect secrets.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
It all started with a crazy idea

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
in November of 2004.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
just like this.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
They were blank on one side,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and on the other side

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I listed some simple instructions.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
they'd never told anyone before.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And I handed out these postcards randomly

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
on the streets of Washington, D.C.,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
not knowing what to expect.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
But soon the idea began spreading virally.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
People began to buy their own postcards

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and make their own postcards.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C.,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
but from Texas, California,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
PostSecret.com

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And this is my postcard collection today.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
You can see my wife

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
struggling to stack a brick of postcards

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
What I'd like to do now

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
is share with you a very special handful of secrets

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
from that collection,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
starting with this one.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
"I found these stamps as a child,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and I have been waiting all my life

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
to have someone to send them to.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I never did have someone."

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Secrets can take many forms.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
They can be shocking

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
or silly or soulful.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
They can connect us to our deepest humanity

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
or with people we'll never meet.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.260
(Laughter)

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Maybe one of you sent this one in.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I don't know.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
This one does a great job of demonstrating

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
the creativity that people have

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
when they make and mail me a postcard.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.260
with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
I've found love. I'm happy."

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
of frailty and heroism,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
playing out silently

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
in the lives of people all around us

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
even now.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260
"Everyone who knew me before 9/11

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
believes I'm dead."

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
so sometimes I didn't wear panties,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.260
(Laughter)

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I love to speak on college campuses

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and share secrets and the stories with students.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and sign books and take photos with students.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
And this next postcard was made

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
out of one of those photos.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And I should also mention that, just like today,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
at that PostSecret event,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I was using a wireless microphone.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
We all heard you pee."

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.260
(Laughter)

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
This was really embarrassing when it happened,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.260
until I realized it could have been worse.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Right. You know what I'm saying.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
(Laughter)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
"Inside this envelope

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
is the ripped up remains

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
of a suicide note I didn't use.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
"One of these men is the father of my son.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.260
(Laughter)

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
well, I was getting your ring.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
It's in my pocket right now."

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
two years ago on Valentine's Day.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
before I received this exuberant email

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
from the guy who mailed me this postcard.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
this story that just played out in my life."

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
He said, "My knees are still shaking."

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
we've made it this Sunday morning ritual

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
to visit the PostSecret blog together

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and read the secrets out loud.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I read some to her, she reads some to me."

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
He says, "It's really brought us closer together

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
through the years.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And so when I discovered

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that you had posted

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I was beside myself.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And just like every Sunday,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.260
we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
to get through each one."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But she finally did.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And she turned to him and said,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
"Is that our cat?"

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.260
(Laughter)

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And when she saw him,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
He popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So I emailed him back

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and I said, "Please share with me an image, something,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that I can share with the whole PostSecret community

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And he emailed me this picture.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.260
(Laughter)

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
I finally got the pictures developed

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and I'd love to give them to you."

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
This picture never got returned back

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
to the people who lost it,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
but this secret has impacted many lives,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
starting with a student up in Canada

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
named Matty.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Matty was inspired by that secret

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to start his own website,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
a website called IFoundYourCamera.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Matty invites people

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to mail him digital cameras that they've found,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
memory sticks that have been lost

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
with orphan photos.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
and posts them on his website every week.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And people come to visit

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to see if they can identify a picture they've lost

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
or help somebody else get the photos back to them

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that they might be desperately searching for.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
This one's my favorite.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
(Laughter)

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Matty has found this ingenious way

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to leverage the kindness of strangers.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Matty shared with me

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
an emotional email he received

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.260
from the mother in that picture.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
"That's me, my husband and son.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Thank you for making your site.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
These pictures mean more to me than you know.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
My son's birth is on this camera.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
He turns four tomorrow."

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
Every picture that you see there

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
and thousands of others

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
have been returned back to the person who lost it --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
sometimes crossing oceans,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
sometimes going through language barriers.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
"When people I love

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
leave voicemails on my phone

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
I always save them in case they die tomorrow

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and I have no other way

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
of hearing their voice ever again."

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
When I posted this secret,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
dozens of people

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
sent voicemail messages from their phones,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
messages from family or friends

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
who had died.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
They said that by preserving those voices

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and sharing them,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.260
it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
One young girl

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
posted the last message

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
she ever heard from her grandmother.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Secrets can take many forms.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
They can be shocking or silly

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
or soulful.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
They can connect us with our deepest humanity

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260
or with people we'll never meet again.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Voicemail recording: First saved voice message.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Grandma: ♫ It's somebody's birthday today ♫

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.260
♫ Somebody's birthday today ♫

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
♫ The candles are lighted ♫

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
♫ on somebody's cake ♫

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
♫ And we're all invited ♫

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
♫ for somebody's sake ♫

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
You're 21 years old today.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Have a real happy birthday, and I love you.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
I'll say bye for now.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
FW: Thank you.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.260
(Applause)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Thank you.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:29.260
(Applause)

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
June Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
so touching.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret?

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
FW: I have one of my own secrets in every book.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I think in some ways, the reason I started the project,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
even though I didn't know it at the time,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
was because I was struggling with my own secrets.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And it was through crowd-sourcing,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
that I could uncover

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
parts of my past that were haunting me.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
JC: And has anyone ever discovered

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
which secret was yours in the book?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Has anyone in your life been able to tell?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
FW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
(Laughter)

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:17.260
(Applause)
