00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:19.796
(Nature sounds)

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.512
When I first began
recording wild soundscapes

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:24.443
45 years ago,

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.865
I had no idea that ants,

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:30.344
insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.472
created a sound signature.

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:33.915
But they do.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:37.328
And so does every wild
habitat on the planet,

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.563
like the Amazon rainforest
you're hearing behind me.

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:44.137
In fact, temperate
and tropical rainforests

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.317
each produce a vibrant animal orchestra,

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.545
that instantaneous
and organized expression

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.353
of insects, reptiles,
amphibians, birds and mammals.

00:00:55.377 --> 00:00:58.280
And every soundscape
that springs from a wild habitat

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:01.872
generates its own unique signature,

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.789
one that contains incredible
amounts of information,

00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:09.148
and it's some of that information
I want to share with you today.

00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:12.354
The soundscape is made
up of three basic sources.

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.893
The first is the geophony,

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:17.259
or the nonbiological sounds that occur

00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:19.236
in any given habitat,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.828
like wind in the trees, water in a stream,

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.422
waves at the ocean shore,
movement of the Earth.

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.700
The second of these is the biophony.

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:31.822
The biophony is all of the sound

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.940
that's generated by organisms
in a given habitat

00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:38.560
at one time and in one place.

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:43.094
And the third is all of the sound
that we humans generate

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.912
that's called anthrophony.

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:48.273
Some of it is controlled,
like music or theater,

00:01:48.297 --> 00:01:52.190
but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,

00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:55.895
which some of us refer to as noise.

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.595
There was a time when
I considered wild soundscapes

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.327
to be a worthless artifact.

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:04.409
They were just there,
but they had no significance.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.782
Well, I was wrong. What
I learned from these encounters

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:12.558
was that careful listening gives
us incredibly valuable tools

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:15.142
by which to evaluate
the health of a habitat

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.954
across the entire spectrum of life.

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:22.166
When I began recording in the late '60s,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.442
the typical methods
of recording were limited

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:29.910
to the fragmented capture
of individual species

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:33.006
like birds mostly, in the beginning,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.707
but later animals
like mammals and amphibians.

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:42.219
To me, this was a little like trying
to understand

00:02:42.243 --> 00:02:45.284
the magnificence
of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:48.193
by abstracting the sound
of a single violin player

00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:50.763
out of the context of the orchestra

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:53.866
and hearing just that one part.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.883
Fortunately, more and more institutions

00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:58.951
are implementing the more holistic models

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:01.314
that I and a few of my colleagues
have introduced

00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:05.187
to the field of soundscape ecology.

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:10.255
When I began recording
over four decades ago,

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.664
I could record for 10 hours

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:14.899
and capture one hour of usable material,

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:17.956
good enough for an album
or a film soundtrack

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.675
or a museum installation.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.628
Now, because of global warming,

00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:25.046
resource extraction,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.115
and human noise, among many other factors,

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.791
it can take up to 1,000 hours or more

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.624
to capture the same thing.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:36.679
Fully 50 percent of my archive

00:03:36.703 --> 00:03:39.875
comes from habitats so radically altered

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.775
that they're either altogether silent

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.496
or can no longer be heard
in any of their original form.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.782
The usual methods of evaluating a habitat

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:53.108
have been done by visually
counting the numbers of species

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:57.313
and the numbers of individuals
within each species in a given area.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.865
However, by comparing
data that ties together

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.665
both density and diversity
from what we hear,

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:09.038
I'm able to arrive at much
more precise fitness outcomes.

00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:11.078
And I want to show you some examples

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:13.868
that typify the possibilities unlocked

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:16.890
by diving into this universe.

00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:18.282
This is Lincoln Meadow.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:20.497
Lincoln
Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:23.390
east of San Francisco
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,

00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:25.487
at about 2,000 meters altitude,

00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.296
and I've been recording
there for many years.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.216
In 1988, a logging company
convinced local residents

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.378
that there would be absolutely
no environmental impact

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.022
from a new method they were trying

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:38.742
called "selective logging,"

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.297
taking out a tree here and there

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.580
rather than clear-cutting a whole area.

00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:45.340
With permission granted to record

00:04:45.364 --> 00:04:47.303
both before and after the operation,

00:04:47.327 --> 00:04:51.921
I set up my gear and captured
a large number of dawn choruses

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:55.454
to very strict protocol
and calibrated recordings,

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:57.648
because I wanted a really good baseline.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.833
This is an example of a spectrogram.

00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:02.264
A spectrogram is a graphic
illustration of sound

00:05:02.288 --> 00:05:05.437
with time from left
to right across the page --

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:07.944
15 seconds in this case is represented â€”

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.799
and frequency from the bottom
of the page to the top,

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.018
lowest to highest.

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:15.152
And you can see
that the signature of a stream

00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:19.957
is represented here in the bottom
third or half of the page,

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:23.400
while birds that were once in that meadow

00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:26.457
are represented in the signature
across the top.

00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:27.612
There were a lot of them.

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:30.776
And here's Lincoln Meadow
before selective logging.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:45.569
(Nature sounds)

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:47.447
Well, a year later I returned,

00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:49.204
and using the same protocols

00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:51.919
and recording under the same conditions,

00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:54.147
I recorded a number of examples

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:56.247
of the same dawn choruses,

00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.390
and now this is what we've got.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:05:59.670
This is after selective logging.

00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:01.980
You can see that the stream
is still represented

00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:03.650
in the bottom third of the page,

00:06:03.674 --> 00:06:08.153
but notice what's missing
in the top two thirds.

00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:13.666
(Nature sounds)

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:23.153
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.

00:06:23.177 --> 00:06:25.743
Well, I've returned
to Lincoln Meadow 15 times

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:27.227
in the last 25 years,

00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.913
and I can tell you that the biophony,

00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:33.818
the density and diversity
of that biophony,

00:06:33.842 --> 00:06:36.370
has not yet returned
to anything like it was

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:38.568
before the operation.

00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:41.666
But here's a picture
of Lincoln Meadow taken after,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.904
and you can see
that from the perspective of the camera

00:06:44.928 --> 00:06:46.015
or the human eye,

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.790
hardly a stick or a tree
appears to be out of place,

00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:51.730
which would confirm the logging
company's contention

00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:54.359
that there's nothing
of environmental impact.

00:06:54.383 --> 00:07:00.776
However, our ears tell us
a very different story.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.603
Young students are always asking me

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:04.056
what these animals are saying,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.887
and really I've got no idea.

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:14.156
But I can tell you that they do
express themselves.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.234
Whether or not we understand
it is a different story.

00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:19.562
I was walking along the shore in Alaska,

00:07:19.586 --> 00:07:21.906
and I came across this tide pool

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.938
filled with a colony of sea anemones,

00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:27.014
these wonderful eating machines,

00:07:27.038 --> 00:07:29.865
relatives of coral and jellyfish.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.223
And curious to see
if any of them made any noise,

00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:33.394
I dropped a hydrophone,

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:36.386
an underwater microphone
covered in rubber,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.574
down the mouth part,

00:07:37.598 --> 00:07:39.335
and immediately the critter began

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.544
to absorb the microphone into its belly,

00:07:41.568 --> 00:07:44.238
and the tentacles were
searching out of the surface

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:46.649
for something of nutritional value.

00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:49.154
The static-like sounds that are very low,

00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:51.158
that you're going to hear right now.

00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:55.560
(Static sounds)

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.427
Yeah, but watch. When it
didn't find anything to eat --

00:07:58.451 --> 00:07:59.816
(Honking sound)

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.476
(Laughter)

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.973
I think that's an expression
that can be understood

00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:06.390
in any language.

00:08:06.414 --> 00:08:11.256
(Laughter)

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.856
At the end of its breeding cycle,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.012
the Great Basin Spadefoot toad

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.087
digs itself down about a meter under

00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.237
the hard-panned desert
soil of the American West,

00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:22.116
where it can stay for many seasons

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.616
until conditions are just
right for it to emerge again.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.736
And when there's enough moisture
in the soil

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.531
in the spring, frogs will dig
themselves to the surface

00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:34.602
and gather around these
large, vernal pools

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:36.639
in great numbers.

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:40.045
And they vocalize in a chorus

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:43.253
that's absolutely in sync
with one another.

00:08:43.277 --> 00:08:44.849
And they do that for two reasons.

00:08:44.873 --> 00:08:48.278
The first is competitive,
because they're looking for mates,

00:08:48.302 --> 00:08:49.731
and the second is cooperative,

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:52.212
because if they're
all vocalizing in sync together,

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:56.371
it makes it really difficult
for predators like coyotes,

00:08:56.395 --> 00:09:00.590
foxes and owls to single
out any individual for a meal.

00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:03.862
This is a spectrogram
of what the frog chorusing looks like

00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:06.123
when it's in a very healthy pattern.

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:16.139
(Frogs croaking)

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:20.104
Mono Lake is just to the east
of Yosemite National Park

00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:21.933
in California,

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:24.788
and it's a favorite
habitat of these toads,

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:27.675
and it's also favored by U.S.
Navy jet pilots,

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:30.721
who train in their fighters
flying them at speeds

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:33.179
exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour

00:09:33.203 --> 00:09:35.960
and altitudes only a couple hundred meters

00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:38.539
above ground level of the Mono Basin,

00:09:38.563 --> 00:09:42.213
very fast, very low, and so loud

00:09:42.237 --> 00:09:45.079
that the anthrophony, the human noise,

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:47.103
even though it's six and a half kilometers

00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:49.903
from the frog pond you
just heard a second ago,

00:09:49.927 --> 00:09:53.469
it masked the sound
of the chorusing toads.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.735
You can see in this spectrogram
that all of the energy

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.482
that was once in the first
spectrogram is gone

00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:01.229
from the top end of the spectrogram,

00:10:01.253 --> 00:10:04.063
and that there's breaks
in the chorusing at two and a half,

00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:06.255
four and a half,
and six and a half seconds,

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:09.354
and then the sound
of the jet, the signature,

00:10:09.378 --> 00:10:11.913
is in yellow at the very
bottom of the page.

00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:21.558
(Frogs croaking)

00:10:21.582 --> 00:10:23.952
Now at the end of that flyby,

00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:27.441
it took the frogs fully 45 minutes

00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:29.845
to regain their chorusing synchronicity,

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:32.790
during which time, and under a full moon,

00:10:32.814 --> 00:10:35.571
we watched as two coyotes
and a great horned owl

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:38.694
came in to pick
off a few of their numbers.

00:10:38.718 --> 00:10:42.220
The good news is that, with a little bit
of habitat restoration

00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:44.925
and fewer flights, the frog populations,

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:48.648
once diminishing
during the 1980s and early '90s,

00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:52.181
have pretty much returned to normal.

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:55.120
I want to end with a story
told by a beaver.

00:10:55.144 --> 00:10:56.594
It's a very sad story,

00:10:56.618 --> 00:11:00.472
but it really illustrates how animals

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:02.454
can sometimes show emotion,

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:07.106
a very controversial subject
among some older biologists.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.339
A colleague of mine was recording
in the American Midwest

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.881
around this pond that had been formed

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:16.780
maybe 16,000 years ago at the end
of the last ice age.

00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:18.933
It was also formed in part by a beaver dam

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:21.851
at one end that held
that whole ecosystem together

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:24.603
in a very delicate balance.

00:11:24.627 --> 00:11:28.378
And one afternoon, while he was recording,

00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:32.202
there suddenly appeared
from out of nowhere

00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.650
a couple of game wardens,

00:11:34.674 --> 00:11:36.245
who for no apparent reason,

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:37.824
walked over to the beaver dam,

00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:41.106
dropped a stick of dynamite
down it, blowing it up,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.136
killing the female and her young babies.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.968
Horrified, my colleagues remained behind

00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:50.009
to gather his thoughts

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:53.493
and to record whatever he could
the rest of the afternoon,

00:11:53.517 --> 00:11:58.386
and that evening, he captured
a remarkable event:

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.575
the lone surviving male beaver
swimming in slow circles

00:12:02.599 --> 00:12:08.308
crying out inconsolably for its
lost mate and offspring.

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:11.217
This is probably the saddest sound

00:12:11.241 --> 00:12:14.135
I've ever heard coming from any organism,

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:16.878
human or other.

00:12:18.517 --> 00:12:34.156
(Beaver crying)

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.971
Yeah. Well.

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:38.553
There are many facets to soundscapes,

00:12:38.577 --> 00:12:41.769
among them the ways in which animals
taught us to dance and sing,

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:44.394
which I'll save for another time.

00:12:44.418 --> 00:12:47.412
But you have heard how biophonies

00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:51.255
help clarify our understanding
of the natural world.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.719
You've heard the impact
of resource extraction,

00:12:53.743 --> 00:12:56.783
human noise and habitat destruction.

00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:59.046
And where environmental
sciences have typically

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.103
tried to understand
the world from what we see,

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:06.571
a much fuller understanding
can be got from what we hear.

00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:10.428
Biophonies and geophonies
are the signature voices

00:13:10.452 --> 00:13:12.419
of the natural world,

00:13:12.443 --> 00:13:13.772
and as we hear them,

00:13:13.796 --> 00:13:16.444
we're endowed with a sense of place,

00:13:16.468 --> 00:13:19.861
the true story of the world we live in.

00:13:19.885 --> 00:13:21.780
In a matter of seconds,

00:13:21.804 --> 00:13:24.495
a soundscape reveals much more information

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:26.043
from many perspectives,

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:30.665
from quantifiable data
to cultural inspiration.

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:33.566
Visual capture implicitly frames

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.562
a limited frontal perspective
of a given spatial context,

00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.935
while soundscapes widen that scope

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:45.120
to a full 360 degrees,
completely enveloping us.

00:13:45.144 --> 00:13:48.892
And while a picture may
be worth 1,000 words,

00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:53.265
a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.

00:13:53.289 --> 00:13:55.389
And our ears tell us

00:13:55.413 --> 00:13:58.984
that the whisper
of every leaf and creature

00:13:59.008 --> 00:14:02.058
speaks to the natural
sources of our lives,

00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:07.120
which indeed may hold the secrets
of love for all things,

00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:09.078
especially our own humanity,

00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:15.363
and the last word goes
to a jaguar from the Amazon.

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:29.111
(Growling)

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:31.311
Thank you for listening.

00:14:31.335 --> 00:14:37.032
(Applause)
