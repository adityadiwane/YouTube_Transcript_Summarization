00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.339
So if someone asked you

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.101
for the three words that would sum up

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.983
your reputation, what would you say?

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:26.378
How would people describe your judgment,

00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:30.135
your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.502
Today I'd like to explore with you

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:34.174
why the answer to this question

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:36.315
will become profoundly important

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:40.912
in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:43.495
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:47.097
whose life has been changed by a marketplace

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.200
fueled by reputation.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.290
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.829
on Airbnb since 2008.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.760
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.624
of several cups of tea, he told me how

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:03.007
hosting guests from all over the world

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:04.474
has enriched his life.

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:07.847
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:10.879
watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:15.311
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:19.262
happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:21.855
and she promised that she would refrain from leaving

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:25.277
a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.

00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:29.344
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:32.503
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:36.454
marketplace that matches people who have space to rent

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:39.239
with people who are looking for a place to stay

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.926
in over 192 countries.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:44.616
The places being rented out are things that you might

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:47.448
expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:50.021
but part of the magic is the unique places

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.959
that you can now access: treehouses, teepees,

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.051
airplane hangars, igloos.

00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:59.510
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.343
that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:05.691
It's a fantastic example of how technology

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.407
is creating a market

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:09.906
for things that never had a marketplace before.

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:13.037
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.595
to see how insanely fast it's growing.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.259
This image here is from 2008.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.978
The pink dots represent host properties.

00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:25.971
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.463
seemed like a crazy idea.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:30.684
Now the same view in 2010.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.486
And now, 2012.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:38.625
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:43.256
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:47.617
the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.535
and value of all kinds of assets,

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:53.993
from skills to spaces to material possessions,

00:02:53.993 --> 00:02:57.472
in ways and on a scale never possible before.

00:02:57.472 --> 00:03:00.696
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:03.488
and, through it, people like Sebastian

00:03:03.488 --> 00:03:05.559
are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.257
They're empowered to make money and save money

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:10.956
from their existing assets.

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:13.475
But the real magic and the secret source behind

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:16.244
collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:18.879
isn't the inventory or the money.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.396
It's using the power of technology to build trust

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:23.887
between strangers.

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.419
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.694
during the London riots.

00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:31.400
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.577
and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.099
if he was okay.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.271
Former guests from around the world had seen that

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.364
the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted

00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:42.665
to check if he needed anything.

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.850
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.013
contacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:54.390
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.294
I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,

00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:59.844
and why, after I finished my book, I decided

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:03.534
I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:07.191
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.

00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:11.352
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:14.274
connections that are enabling us to rediscover

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:17.673
a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:21.993
by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,

00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:25.226
like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:28.253
versus empty transactions.

00:04:28.253 --> 00:04:31.581
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.874
to old market principles and collaborative behaviors

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.586
that are hard-wired in all of us.

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.275
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:40.963
for the Facebook age.

00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:44.515
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:48.730
our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.464
just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:55.666
our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.465
our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.362
money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.

00:05:01.362 --> 00:05:03.880
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.466
to coding on Skillshare,

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:09.524
and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:13.979
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.200
that's enabling us to match wants with haves

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.170
in more democratic ways.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.840
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.164
of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,

00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:30.075
but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,

00:05:30.075 --> 00:05:33.265
where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:36.817
people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.

00:05:36.817 --> 00:05:41.110
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.144
is because every new advancement of technology

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:48.218
increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:51.603
to make sharing easier and easier.

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:54.571
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,

00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:59.283
and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.

00:05:59.283 --> 00:06:01.275
Let me give you an example.

00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:05.693
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,

00:06:05.693 --> 00:06:09.101
the best job title here of SuperRabbit.

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:13.681
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:17.071
as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,

00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:19.923
he struggled to find a new one during the recession.

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:23.310
And then he happened to stumble across a post about

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.774
TaskRabbit.

00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:28.144
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:32.231
great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.

00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:35.478
Now what happened was, in February 2008,

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.142
Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them

00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:41.583
out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:43.943
and he was salivating with saliva.

00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:46.636
They realized they'd run out of dog food.

00:06:46.636 --> 00:06:49.880
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.194
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:56.983
starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.023
eBay for errands existed.

00:06:59.023 --> 00:07:01.678
Six months later, Leah quit her job,

00:07:01.678 --> 00:07:04.267
and TaskRabbit was born.

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:08.132
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting

00:07:08.132 --> 00:07:12.720
on a bigger idea she later called service networking.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.253
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships

00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:19.570
to get things done in the real world.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.179
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.746
the tasks that they want doing, name the price

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.385
they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits

00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:28.918
bid to run the errand.

00:07:28.918 --> 00:07:33.411
Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.199
that's designed to find the people that would make

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.857
great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:43.826
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:46.843
and 5,000 more on the waiting list.

00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:49.610
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.971
expect, like help with household chores

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.152
or doing some supermarket runs.

00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:57.994
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand

00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:01.017
loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded

00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:02.729
through TaskRabbit.

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:06.541
But I love that the number one task posted,

00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:09.818
over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:12.386
have felt the pain of doing:

00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:18.846
yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:22.563
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here

00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:25.163
is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:28.314
running errands around his life.

00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:31.649
And 70 percent of this new labor force

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:35.113
were previously unemployed or underemployed.

00:08:35.113 --> 00:08:38.507
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption

00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:41.946
are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.

00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:45.971
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,

00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:49.170
that over the past 20 years, we've evolved

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.682
from trusting people online to share information

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:55.545
to trusting to handing over our credit card information,

00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:58.843
and now we're entering the third trust wave:

00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:02.571
connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds

00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:05.098
of people-powered marketplaces.

00:09:05.098 --> 00:09:06.813
I actually came across this fascinating study

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.253
by the Pew Center this week that revealed

00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:12.785
that an active Facebook user is three times as likely

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:17.820
as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.197
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:23.602
face to face.

00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:26.897
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:30.617
comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need

00:09:30.617 --> 00:09:35.058
to address some pressing, complex questions.

00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:37.644
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:41.107
real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?

00:09:41.107 --> 00:09:44.787
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?

00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:46.670
How do we stop people who've behaved badly

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.364
in one community doing so under a different guise?

00:09:50.364 --> 00:09:53.459
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.922
credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,

00:09:56.922 --> 00:09:59.970
or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.715
on transactions between relative strangers

00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:05.659
need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.620
and Chris are good eggs,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.740
and that device is reputation.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.738
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.

00:10:15.738 --> 00:10:17.373
Let's just take a look at Chris.

00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:20.666
You can see that over 200 people have given him

00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.905
an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.

00:10:23.905 --> 00:10:26.185
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:28.569
describing him as super-friendly and fast,

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:32.291
and he's reached level 25, the highest level,

00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:34.248
making him a SuperRabbit.

00:10:34.248 --> 00:10:37.146
Now — (Laughter) -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.

00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:40.805
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation

00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:43.964
has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid

00:10:43.964 --> 00:10:45.917
and how much he can charge.

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:48.655
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:50.724
has a real world value.

00:10:50.724 --> 00:10:52.760
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.303
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers

00:10:55.303 --> 00:10:58.859
on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:02.099
The difference today is that, with every trade we make,

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:05.499
comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.441
we leave a reputation trail

00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.987
of how well we can and can't be trusted.

00:11:10.987 --> 00:11:13.572
And it's not just the breadth but the volume

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.210
of reputation data out there that is staggering.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.514
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked

00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:22.473
on Airbnb in the past six months alone.

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:26.436
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.323
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:31.551
will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.

00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:35.905
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data

00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:39.277
on how well we behave or misbehave.

00:11:39.277 --> 00:11:42.866
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:46.119
that we leave in different places is a massive challenge,

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:48.721
but one we're being asked to figure out.

00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:52.005
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:54.970
is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.844
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested

00:11:57.844 --> 00:12:01.251
on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him

00:12:01.251 --> 00:12:03.317
from one community to another?

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:06.029
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.785
books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?

00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:13.460
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.648
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:20.451
because my credit history didn't travel with me.

00:12:20.451 --> 00:12:23.395
I was essentially a ghost in the system.

00:12:23.395 --> 00:12:26.410
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.306
of the reputation economy is about

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:32.675
adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.

00:12:32.675 --> 00:12:36.137
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?

00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:38.584
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:42.185
tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.

00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:45.465
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:47.352
that indicate our trustworthiness.

00:12:47.352 --> 00:12:50.952
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind

00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:54.893
is that reputation is largely contextual.

00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:57.627
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host

00:12:57.627 --> 00:13:01.576
does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.

00:13:01.576 --> 00:13:04.909
The big challenge is figuring out what data

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.674
makes sense to pull, because the future's

00:13:07.674 --> 00:13:11.062
going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,

00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:13.874
not a single algorithm.

00:13:13.874 --> 00:13:17.625
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:20.024
a Facebook- or Google-like search

00:13:20.024 --> 00:13:22.946
and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.826
in different contexts over time.

00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:29.461
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,

00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:33.616
when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:35.596
your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,

00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:39.044
the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear],

00:13:39.044 --> 00:13:41.627
they'll all live together in one place,

00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:45.098
and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard

00:13:45.098 --> 00:13:49.655
that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.

00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:52.487
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching

00:13:52.487 --> 00:13:55.069
and writing my next book on, and currently define

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:58.844
as the worth of your reputation, your intentions,

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:03.225
capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:06.133
This isn't some far-off frontier.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:09.167
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:12.670
and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.653
you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.

00:14:17.653 --> 00:14:21.366
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little

00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:24.932
Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:28.332
enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,

00:14:28.332 --> 00:14:32.204
but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:35.117
we can actually control it more, and extract

00:14:35.117 --> 00:14:37.837
the immense value that will flow from it.

00:14:37.837 --> 00:14:40.568
Also, more so than our credit history,

00:14:40.568 --> 00:14:43.204
we can actually shape our reputation.

00:14:43.204 --> 00:14:44.523
Just think of Sebastian

00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:47.370
and how he bought the cat to influence his.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.884
Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue

00:14:51.884 --> 00:14:54.638
I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,

00:14:54.638 --> 00:14:58.034
people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,

00:14:58.034 --> 00:15:00.798
but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?

00:15:00.798 --> 00:15:04.214
How do we take their contributions to their jobs,

00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:06.218
their communities and their families,

00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:10.126
and convert that value into reputation capital?

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:13.910
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.748
could create a massive positive disruption

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:20.493
in who has power, trust and influence.

00:15:20.493 --> 00:15:24.133
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:26.830
that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.774
will no longer be the determining factor

00:15:29.774 --> 00:15:33.142
in how much things cost, what we can access,

00:15:33.142 --> 00:15:36.062
and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.

00:15:36.062 --> 00:15:40.470
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:45.717
more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.

00:15:45.717 --> 00:15:48.414
Reputation will be the currency that says

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.598
that you can trust me.

00:15:50.598 --> 00:15:53.902
Now the interesting thing is, reputation

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:55.913
is the socioeconomic lubricant

00:15:55.913 --> 00:16:00.711
that makes collaborative consumption work and scale,

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.521
but the sources it will be generated from,

00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:07.006
and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.

00:16:07.006 --> 00:16:09.945
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting,

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:13.999
where reputation data will make the résumé seem

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:18.077
like an archaic relic of the past.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:22.100
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.198
Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something

00:16:27.198 --> 00:16:29.742
called Stack Overflow.

00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:33.166
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:35.684
experienced programmers can ask

00:16:35.684 --> 00:16:40.197
other good programmers highly detailed technical questions

00:16:40.197 --> 00:16:44.189
on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.

00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:48.085
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,

00:16:48.085 --> 00:16:51.684
and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.

00:16:51.684 --> 00:16:54.734
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,

00:16:54.734 --> 00:16:57.367
but it's basically by convincing their peers

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.741
they know what they're talking about.

00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:02.518
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders

00:17:02.518 --> 00:17:04.940
heard about something interesting,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.623
and it actually didn't surprise them.

00:17:06.623 --> 00:17:10.211
What they heard was that users were putting

00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:13.655
their reputation scores on the top of their résumés,

00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:16.464
and that recruiters were searching the platform

00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:18.710
to find people with unique talents.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.617
Now thousands of programmers today are finding

00:17:21.617 --> 00:17:25.004
better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow

00:17:25.004 --> 00:17:28.225
and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window

00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:30.920
into how someone really behaves,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.240
and what their peers think of them.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.744
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:38.291
I think, is incredibly exciting.

00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:41.585
People are starting to realize that the reputation

00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:44.761
they generate in one place has value

00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:47.655
beyond the environments from which it was built.

00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:49.691
You know, it's very interesting.

00:17:49.691 --> 00:17:52.740
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.214
or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,

00:17:57.214 --> 00:18:00.261
they all talk about how having a high reputation

00:18:00.261 --> 00:18:03.576
unlocks a sense of their own power.

00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.502
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:09.429
enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.

00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:12.581
On Airbnb, the people often become more important

00:18:12.581 --> 00:18:15.174
than the spaces. On TaskRabbit,

00:18:15.174 --> 00:18:18.367
it gives people control of their economic activity.

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:21.700
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.341
on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer

00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:28.567
in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around

00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:31.405
the world who've said something wonderful about him,

00:18:31.405 --> 00:18:34.076
and what that says about him as a person.

00:18:34.076 --> 00:18:37.524
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced

00:18:37.524 --> 00:18:41.132
that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb

00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:43.883
will lead him to doing something interesting

00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:46.440
with the rest of his life.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.420
You know, there are only a few windows in history

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.644
where the opportunity exists to reinvent

00:18:53.644 --> 00:18:56.979
part of how our socioeconomic system works.

00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:59.444
We're living through one of those moments.

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:03.075
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:06.855
that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:10.464
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit

00:19:10.464 --> 00:19:13.708
transformed our consumer system, and in many ways

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.493
controlled who had access to what.

00:19:16.493 --> 00:19:19.508
In the 21st century, new trust networks,

00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:22.882
and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent

00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:27.148
the way we think about wealth, markets, power

00:19:27.148 --> 00:19:31.732
and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.

00:19:31.732 --> 00:19:34.699
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:40.190
(Applause)
