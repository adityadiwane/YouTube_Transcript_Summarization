00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:15.342
I'm driven by pure passion

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.039
to create photographs that tell stories.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:23.245
Photography can be described
as the recording of a single moment

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.475
frozen within a fraction of time.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:30.337
Each moment or photograph
represents a tangible piece

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.874
of our memories as time passes.

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.136
But what if you could capture more
than one moment in a photograph?

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.533
What if a photograph
could actually collapse time,

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:44.140
compressing the best moments
of the day and the night

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:46.663
seamlessly into one single image?

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:50.172
I've created a concept
called "Day to Night"

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.823
and I believe it's going to change

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:53.284
the way you look at the world.

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:54.458
I know it has for me.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.870
My process begins by photographing
iconic locations,

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.735
places that are part of what I call
our collective memory.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.000
I photograph from a fixed vantage point,
and I never move.

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:11.371
I capture the fleeting moments
of humanity and light as time passes.

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:14.848
Photographing for anywhere
from 15 to 30 hours

00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:17.109
and shooting over 1,500 images,

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:20.213
I then choose the best moments
of the day and night.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.010
Using time as a guide,

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:27.327
I seamlessly blend those best moments
into one single photograph,

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.999
visualizing our conscious
journey with time.

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.400
I can take you to Paris

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:35.273
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:38.456
And I can show you the
early morning rowers

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.797
along the River Seine.

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:42.396
And simultaneously,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.654
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.319
And in between, I can show you
the romance of the City of Light.

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:55.177
I am essentially a street photographer
from 50 feet in the air,

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.531
and every single thing you see
in this photograph

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:59.416
actually happened on this day.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.702
Day to Night is a global project,

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.019
and my work has always been about history.

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:11.417
I'm fascinated by the concept
of going to a place like Venice

00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.969
and actually seeing it during
a specific event.

00:02:13.993 --> 00:02:17.426
And I decided I wanted to see
the historical Regata,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.929
an event that's actually been
taking place since 1498.

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:25.548
The boats and the costumes
look exactly as they did then.

00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.323
And an important element that I really
want you guys to understand is:

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:31.821
this is not a timelapse,

00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:35.709
this is me photographing
throughout the day and the night.

00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:40.487
I am a relentless collector
of magical moments.

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:44.546
And the thing that drives me
is the fear of just missing one of them.

00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:52.869
The entire concept came about in 1996.

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:57.118
LIFE Magazine commissioned me
to create a panoramic photograph

00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:01.797
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's
film Romeo + Juliet.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.087
I got to the set and realized:
it's a square.

00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:10.509
So the only way I could actually create
a panoramic was to shoot a collage

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.872
of 250 single images.

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.949
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes
embracing.

00:03:16.973 --> 00:03:19.763
And as I pan my camera to the right,

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:22.385
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.824
and I saw they were
actually reflecting in it.

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:26.778
And for that one moment, that one image

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:28.668
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss

00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:30.061
for this one picture?"

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.876
And then I came back
to my studio in New York,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.821
and I hand-glued these 250 images together

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:39.670
and stood back and went,
"Wow, this is so cool!

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:42.051
I'm changing time in a photograph."

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:46.612
And that concept actually
stayed with me for 13 years

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:50.619
until technology finally
has caught up to my dreams.

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.504
This is an image I created
of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.809
And I'm going to show you a little video

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.386
that gives you an idea of what
it's like being with me

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.306
when I do these pictures.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.766
To start with, you have to understand
that to get views like this,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.519
most of my time is spent up high,
and I'm usually in a cherry picker

00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:09.694
or a crane.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:13.110
So this is a typical day,
12-18 hours, non-stop

00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:15.296
capturing the entire day unfold.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.266
One of the things that's great
is I love to people-watch.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.703
And trust me when I tell you,

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.925
this is the greatest seat
in the house to have.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:27.330
But this is really how I go about
creating these photographs.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:31.497
So once I decide on my view
and the location,

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.680
I have to decide where day begins
and night ends.

00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:36.846
And that's what I call the time vector.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.759
Einstein described time as a fabric.

00:04:41.257 --> 00:04:43.635
Think of the surface of a trampoline:

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.246
it warps and stretches with gravity.

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.718
I see time as a fabric as well,

00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:55.071
except I take that fabric and flatten it,
compress it into single plane.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.294
One of the unique aspects
of this work is also,

00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:58.818
if you look at all my pictures,

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:00.352
the time vector changes:

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:02.062
sometimes I'll go left to right,

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:06.114
sometimes front to back,
up or down, even diagonally.

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:09.986
I am exploring the space-time continuum

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.249
within a two-dimensional still photograph.

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:15.018
Now when I do these pictures,

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:17.994
it's literally like a real-time puzzle
going on in my mind.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.408
I build a photograph based on time,

00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:23.455
and this is what I call the master plate.

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:26.527
This can take us several
months to complete.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:29.425
The fun thing about this work is

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.779
I have absolutely zero control
when I get up there

00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:35.194
on any given day and capture photographs.

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.512
So I never know who's
going to be in the picture,

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:40.519
if it's going to be a great
sunrise or sunset -- no control.

00:05:40.543 --> 00:05:42.361
It's at the end of the process,

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:45.393
if I've had a really great day
and everything remained the same,

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:48.026
that I then decide who's in and who's out,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.785
and it's all based on time.

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.232
I'll take those best moments that I pick
over a month of editing

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:56.898
and they get seamlessly blended
into the master plate.

00:05:58.168 --> 00:06:00.463
I'm compressing the day and night

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:01.637
as I saw it,

00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.097
creating a unique harmony between
these two very discordant worlds.

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:11.106
Painting has always been a really
important influence in all my work

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.841
and I've always been a huge fan
of Albert Bierstadt,

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:15.699
the great Hudson River School painter.

00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:19.096
He inspired a recent series
that I did on the National Parks.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.389
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:25.092
So this is the photograph
I created of Yosemite.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:29.206
This is actually the cover story
of the 2016 January issue

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.523
of National Geographic.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.347
I photographed for over
30 hours in this picture.

00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:36.242
I was literally on the side of a cliff,

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:41.085
capturing the stars
and the moonlight as it transitions,

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.964
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.

00:06:42.988 --> 00:06:46.982
And I also captured this transition
of time throughout the landscape.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:51.590
The best part is obviously seeing
the magical moments of humanity

00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:52.918
as time changed --

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.291
from day into night.

00:06:58.072 --> 00:06:59.610
And on a personal note,

00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:03.759
I actually had a photocopy
of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.

00:07:03.783 --> 00:07:06.031
And when that sun started
to rise in the valley,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.305
I started to literally shake
with excitement

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.607
because I looked at the painting and I go,

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:14.020
"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's
exact same lighting

00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:15.837
100 years earlier."

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:20.616
Day to Night is about all the things,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.887
it's like a compilation of all
the things I love

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.047
about the medium of photography.

00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.724
It's about landscape,

00:07:26.748 --> 00:07:28.347
it's about street photography,

00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:30.673
it's about color, it's about architecture,

00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:33.814
perspective, scale --
and, especially, history.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.372
This is one of the most historical moments

00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:37.784
I've been able to photograph,

00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:41.157
the 2013 Presidential Inauguration
of Barack Obama.

00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:43.807
And if you look closely in this picture,

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:45.908
you can actually see time changing

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.877
in those large television sets.

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.517
You can see Michelle
waiting with the children,

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.400
the president now greets the crowd,

00:07:52.424 --> 00:07:53.676
he takes his oath,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.707
and now he's speaking to the people.

00:07:56.698 --> 00:08:00.770
There's so many challenging aspects
when I create photographs like this.

00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:03.069
For this particular photograph,

00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:06.708
I was in a 50-foot scissor lift
up in the air

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:08.026
and it was not very stable.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.218
So every time my assistant and I
shifted our weight,

00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:12.780
our horizon line shifted.

00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:14.423
So for every picture you see,

00:08:14.447 --> 00:08:16.836
and there were about
1,800 in this picture,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.819
we both had to tape our feet into position

00:08:19.843 --> 00:08:21.986
every time I clicked the shutter.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.178
(Applause)

00:08:26.202 --> 00:08:30.059
I've learned so many extraordinary
things doing this work.

00:08:30.868 --> 00:08:34.273
I think the two most important
are patience

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:36.479
and the power of observation.

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.360
When you photograph a city
like New York from above,

00:08:40.384 --> 00:08:42.498
I discovered that those people in cars

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.832
that I sort of live with everyday,

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.912
they don't look like people
in cars anymore.

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:49.414
They feel like a giant school of fish,

00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.398
it was a form of emergent behavior.

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:54.983
And when people describe
the energy of New York,

00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:57.943
I think this photograph begins
to really capture that.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.995
When you look closer in my work,

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:02.211
you can see there's stories going on.

00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:05.174
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,

00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:07.474
it's shadow and it's sunlight.

00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:11.081
So I decided, in this photograph,
I would checkerboard time.

00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:13.166
So wherever the shadows are, it's night

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.311
and wherever the sun is,
it's actually day.

00:09:16.453 --> 00:09:18.703
Time is this extraordinary thing

00:09:18.727 --> 00:09:21.338
that we never can really
wrap our heads around.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.942
But in a very unique and special way,

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:27.798
I believe these photographs
begin to put a face on time.

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:33.083
They embody a new
metaphysical visual reality.

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:37.750
When you spend 15 hours
looking at a place,

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:41.124
you're going to see things
a little differently

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:43.156
than if you or I walked up
with our camera,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.151
took a picture, and then walked away.

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:46.766
This was a perfect example.

00:09:47.175 --> 00:09:49.004
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:51.445
I watched over 15 hours

00:09:51.469 --> 00:09:54.017
all these people
not even look at Sacré-Coeur.

00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:56.541
They were more interested
in using it as a backdrop.

00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:59.934
They would walk up, take a picture,

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.644
and then walk away.

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:06.659
And I found this to be an absolutely
extraordinary example,

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:11.294
a powerful disconnect between
what we think the human experience is

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:15.016
versus what the human experience
is evolving into.

00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:20.764
The act of sharing has suddenly
become more important

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:22.683
than the experience itself.

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:26.657
(Applause)

00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:29.817
And finally, my most recent image,

00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:33.111
which has such a special meaning
for me personally:

00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:36.579
this is the Serengeti National
Park in Tanzania.

00:10:36.925 --> 00:10:39.497
And this is photographed
in the middle of the Seronera,

00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:40.876
this is not a reserve.

00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:44.440
I went specifically during
the peak migration

00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:47.535
to hopefully capture
the most diverse range of animals.

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:50.083
Unfortunately, when we got there,

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:52.687
there was a drought going on
during the peak migration,

00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:53.862
a five-week drought.

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:56.479
So all the animals
were drawn to the water.

00:10:56.503 --> 00:10:58.744
I found this one watering hole,

00:10:58.768 --> 00:11:02.793
and felt if everything remained
the same way it was behaving,

00:11:02.817 --> 00:11:06.301
I had a real opportunity
to capture something unique.

00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:08.130
We spent three days studying it,

00:11:08.154 --> 00:11:09.821
and nothing could have prepared me

00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:11.845
for what I witnessed during our shoot day.

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:15.246
I photographed for 26 hours

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.682
in a sealed crocodile blind,
18 feet in the air.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.896
What I witnessed was unimaginable.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.174
Frankly, it was Biblical.

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.546
We saw, for 26 hours,

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.800
all these competitive species
share a single resource called water.

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:34.975
The same resource that humanity
is supposed to have wars over

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:36.633
during the next 50 years.

00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:40.737
The animals never even
grunted at each other.

00:11:41.515 --> 00:11:45.269
They seem to understand something
that we humans don't.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.455
That this precious resource called water

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.586
is something we all have to share.

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:54.310
When I created this picture,

00:11:55.222 --> 00:11:59.476
I realized that Day to Night
is really a new way of seeing,

00:12:00.127 --> 00:12:01.349
compressing time,

00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:05.524
exploring the space-time continuum
within a photograph.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.523
As technology evolves
along with photography,

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:15.253
photographs will not only communicate
a deeper meaning of time and memory,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.705
but they will compose a new narrative
of untold stories,

00:12:22.594 --> 00:12:26.554
creating a timeless window into our world.

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:28.436
Thank you.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:35.126
(Applause)
