00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.373
Today, I want to talk to you about dreams.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.716
I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.716
and it's cooler than in the movies.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.683
(Laughter)

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:25.415
Beyond flying, breathing fire,

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.280
and making hot men
spontaneously appear ...

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:30.281
(Laughter)

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.713
I can do things like read and write music.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:36.675
Fun fact is that I wrote
my personal statement to college

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.019
in a dream.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.798
And I did accepted. So, yeah.

00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:43.679
I am a very visual thinker.

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:46.642
I think in pictures, not words.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:51.405
To me, words are more like
instincts and language.

00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:53.745
There are many people like me;

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.283
Nikola Tesla, for example,

00:00:56.307 --> 00:01:01.322
who could visualize, design,
test, and troubleshoot everything --

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:04.752
all of his inventions --
in his mind, accurately.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.975
Language is kind of exclusive
to our species, anyway.

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.109
I am a bit more primitive,

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.701
like a beta version of Google Translate.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:17.337
(Laughter)

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:22.624
My brain has the ability
to hyper-focus on things that interest me.

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:25.974
For example, once
I had an affair with calculus

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:28.687
that lasted longer
than some celebrity marriages.

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:31.638
(Laughter)

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:35.043
There are some other
unusual things about me.

00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.217
You may have noticed
that I don't have much inflection

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.455
in my voice.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.540
That's why people
often confuse me with a GPS.

00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.438
(Laughter)

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:51.981
This can make basic communication
a challenge, unless you need directions.

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.420
(Laughter)

00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:57.618
Thank you.

00:01:57.642 --> 00:02:01.869
(Applause)

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.839
A few years ago, when I started
doing presentations,

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:08.492
I went to get head shots done
for the first time.

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.124
The photographer told me to look flirty.

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.417
(Laughter)

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:17.030
And I had no idea
what she was talking about.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.700
(Laughter)

00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:21.152
She said, "Do that thing,
you know, with your eyes,

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:23.077
when you're flirting with guys."

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.192
"What thing?" I asked.

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:27.061
"You know, squint."

00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:29.237
And so I tried, really.

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:30.922
It looked something like this.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.843
(Laughter)

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:36.490
I looked like I was searching for Waldo.

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:38.900
(Laughter)

00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:42.314
There's a reason for this,

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:44.907
as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.378
(Laughter)

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:54.506
I have Asperger's,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.522
a high-functioning form of autism

00:02:56.546 --> 00:03:00.022
that impairs the basic social skills
one is expected to display.

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:05.810
It's made life difficult in many ways,

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:09.574
and growing up,
I struggled to fit in socially.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.582
My friends would tell jokes,
but I didn't understand them.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.976
My personal heroes were George Carlin
and Stephen Colbert --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.381
and they taught me humor.

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:26.687
My personality switched
from being shy and awkward

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.504
to being defiant and cursing out a storm.

00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:33.055
Needless to say,
I did not have many friends.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.992
I was also hypersensitive to texture.

00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:40.409
The feel of water on my skin
was like pins and needles,

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.727
and so for years, I refused to shower.

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:47.219
I can assure you that my hygiene routine
is up to standards now, though.

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:48.876
(Laughter)

00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:54.880
I had to do a lot to get here,
and my parents --

00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:59.533
things kind of got out of control
when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,

00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:04.357
and on top of everything,
it made a difficult situation worse.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.833
And I had to travel 2,000 miles
across the country to get treatment,

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:14.531
but within days of them prescribing
a new medication,

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.307
my life turned into an episode
of the Walking Dead.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.221
I became paranoid,
and began to hallucinate

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.269
that rotting corpses
were coming towards me.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:27.611
My family finally rescued me,

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:32.324
but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds
in those three weeks,

00:04:32.348 --> 00:04:34.777
as well as developing severe anemia,

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.562
and was on the verge of suicide.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.855
I transferred to a new treatment center
that understood my aversions,

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.560
my trauma, and my social anxiety,

00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:49.900
and they knew how to treat it,
and I got the help I finally needed.

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:52.774
And after 18 months of hard work,

00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:55.890
I went on to do incredible things.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.138
One of the things with Asperger's
is that oftentimes,

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:02.255
these people have
a very complex inner life,

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.120
and I know for myself,
I have a very colorful personality,

00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:08.848
rich ideas, and just a lot
going on in my mind.

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:12.245
But there's a gap
between where that stands,

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.860
and how I communicate it
with the rest of the world.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:18.892
And this can make
basic communication a challenge.

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:23.365
Not many places would hire me,
due to my lack of social skills,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.689
which is why I applied to Waffle House.

00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:31.300
(Laughter)

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.748
Waffle House is an exceptional
24-hour diner --

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:37.725
(Laughter)

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.003
(Applause)

00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:42.967
thank you --

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:44.750
where you can order your hash browns

00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:47.927
the many ways that someone
would dispose of a human corpse ...

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.584
(Laughter)

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:54.337
Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked,
topped, capped, and covered.

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:56.464
(Laughter)

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:57.933
As social norms would have it,

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:01.454
you should only go to Waffle House
at an ungodly hour in the night.

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:02.629
(Laughter)

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:07.009
So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting
with a waitress, and I asked her,

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.303
"What's the most ridiculous thing
that's happened to you on the job?"

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:14.136
And she told me that one time,
a man walked in completely naked.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.390
(Laughter)

00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:18.262
I said, "Great! Sign me up
for the graveyard shift!"

00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:20.890
(Laughter)

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.705
Needless to say,
Waffle House did not hire me.

00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:30.218
So in terms of having Asperger's,
it can be viewed as a disadvantage,

00:06:30.242 --> 00:06:32.409
and sometimes it is
a real pain in the butt,

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.187
but it's also the opposite.

00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:37.802
It's a gift, and it allows me
to think innovatively.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.640
At 19, I won a research competition
for my research on coral reefs,

00:06:45.664 --> 00:06:47.179
and I ended up speaking

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:49.454
at the UN Convention
of Biological Diversity,

00:06:49.478 --> 00:06:50.974
presenting this research.

00:06:50.998 --> 00:06:52.686
(Applause)

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.868
Thank you.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:58.790
(Applause)

00:06:58.814 --> 00:07:02.809
And at 22, I'm getting ready
to graduate college,

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:07.368
and I am a co-founder of a biotech
company called AutismSees.

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.283
(Applause)

00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:10.562
Thank you.

00:07:10.586 --> 00:07:13.263
(Applause)

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:16.471
But consider what I had to do to get here:

00:07:16.495 --> 00:07:21.786
25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,
and years of pain and trauma.

00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:25.769
I spent a lot of time thinking
if there's a better way,

00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:29.845
and I think there is:
autism-assistive technology.

00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:32.520
This technology
could play an integral role

00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:35.399
in helping people
with autistic spectrum disorder,

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:36.577
or ASD.

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:43.431
The app Podium, released
by my company, AutismSees,

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:48.729
has the ability to independently assess
and help develop communication skills.

00:07:49.324 --> 00:07:53.646
In addition to this, it tracks
eye contact through camera

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.577
and simulates a public-speaking
and job-interview experience.

00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:03.118
And so maybe one day,
Waffle House will hire me,

00:08:03.142 --> 00:08:05.322
after practicing on it some more.

00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:06.527
(Laughter)

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:14.681
And one of the great things
is that I've used Podium

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:19.791
to help me prepare for today,
and it's been a great help.

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.442
But it's more than that.

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.020
There's more that can be done.

00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:27.366
For people with ASD --

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.907
it has been speculated
that many innovative scientists,

00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:36.522
researchers, artists,
and engineers have it;

00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:42.576
like, for example, Emily Dickinson,
Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.337
are some examples.

00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:46.114
But the problem that's encountered

00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:49.975
is that these brilliant ideas
often can't be shared

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:52.263
if there are communication roadblocks.

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:57.975
And so, many people with autism
are being overlooked every day,

00:08:57.999 --> 00:08:59.809
and they're being taken advantage of.

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:08.070
So my dream for people with autism
is to change that,

00:09:08.094 --> 00:09:11.021
to remove the roadblocks
that prevent them from succeeding.

00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:14.310
One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming

00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:17.216
is because it allows me to be free,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.305
without judgment of social
and physical consequences.

00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:24.640
When I'm flying over scenes
that I create in my mind,

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:25.893
I am at peace.

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:29.366
I am free from judgment,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.406
and so I can do whatever I want, you know?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.334
I'm making out with Brad Pitt,
and Angelina is totally cool with it.

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:38.238
(Laughter)

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:43.658
But the goal of autism-assistive
technology is bigger than that,

00:09:43.682 --> 00:09:45.043
and more important.

00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:49.646
My goal is to shift people's perspective

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.650
of autism and people
with higher-functioning Asperger's

00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:58.538
because there is a lot they can do.

00:09:58.562 --> 00:10:01.998
I mean, look at
Temple Grandin, for example.

00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:07.117
And by doing so, we allow people
to share their talents with this world

00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.508
and move this world forward.

00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.754
In addition, we give them the courage
to pursue their dreams

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.066
in the real world, in real time.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.249
Thank you.

00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:19.921
(Applause)

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:21.096
Thank you.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.960
(Applause)
