00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:14.633
This is a photograph

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.449
of a man whom for many years

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.170
I plotted to kill.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.190
This is my father,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.927
Clinton George "Bageye" Grant.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.198
He's called Bageye because he has

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:34.358
permanent bags under his eyes.

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:37.134
As a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:41.250
I dreamt of scraping off the poison

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.200
from fly-killer paper into his coffee,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.055
grounded down glass and sprinkling it

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:50.044
over his breakfast,

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:51.754
loosening the carpet on the stairs

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:55.482
so he would trip and break his neck.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.109
But come the day, he would always

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.361
skip that loose step,

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:01.190
he would always bow out of the house

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.030
without so much as a swig of coffee

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.818
or a bite to eat.

00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:07.104
And so for many years,

00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:09.064
I feared that my father would die

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:11.138
before I had a chance to kill him.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:15.730
(Laughter)

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.721
Up until our mother asked him to leave

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.378
and not come back,

00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:24.634
Bageye had been a terrifying ogre.

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:28.219
He teetered permanently on the verge of rage,

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.827
rather like me, as you see.

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:35.127
He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:38.286
and demanded total silence throughout the house,

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:40.958
so that when we came home from school

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.998
at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:46.248
beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:48.734
we would twiddle with the volume control knob

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.527
on the TV so it was almost inaudible.

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:53.838
And at times, when we were like this,

00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:56.270
so much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.135
going on in the house

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:00.110
that I imagined us to be like

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.610
the German crew of a U-boat

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.102
creeping along the edge of the ocean

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:07.918
whilst up above, on the surface,

00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:11.663
HMS Bageye patrolled

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:13.790
ready to drop death charges

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.777
at the first sound of any disturbance.

00:02:17.777 --> 00:02:20.712
So that lesson was the lesson that

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.160
"Do not draw attention to yourself

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.424
either in the home or outside of the home."

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:27.110
Maybe it's a migrant lesson.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280
We were to be below the radar,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.775
so there was no communication, really,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:34.936
between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:37.544
and the sound that we most looked forward to,

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:39.298
you know when you're a child and you want

00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:42.736
your father to come home
and it's all going to be happy

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:44.490
and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.746
Well the sound that we looked forward to

00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:47.639
was the click of the door closing,

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.347
which meant he'd gone and would not come back.

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:55.806
So for three decades,

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:58.847
I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.

00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:00.615
We never spoke to each other for three decades,

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.416
and then a couple of years ago, I decided

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:06.687
to turn the spotlight on him.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.575
"You are being watched.

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:10.431
Actually, you are.

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:12.495
You are being watched."

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:15.159
That was his mantra to us, his children.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.832
Time and time again he would say this to us.

00:03:16.832 --> 00:03:19.935
And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.564
where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:23.391
and he was a Jamaican.

00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:24.450
And what he meant was,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.561
you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.479
are being watched

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.136
to see which way you turn, to see whether

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:34.255
you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.855
of being feckless, work-shy,

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:39.416
destined for a life of crime.

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.150
You are being watched,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.493
so confound their expectations of you.

00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:49.771
To that end, Bageye and his friends,

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.426
mostly Jamaican,

00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:55.180
exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.794
Turn your best side to the world,

00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:00.068
show your best face to the world.

00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:01.842
If you have seen some of the images

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.978
of the Caribbean people arriving

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.630
in the '40s and '50s,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.026
you might have noticed that a lot of the men

00:04:07.026 --> 00:04:08.915
wear trilbies.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.556
Now, there was no tradition
of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.

00:04:12.556 --> 00:04:15.499
They invented that tradition for their arrival here.

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.266
They wanted to project themselves in a way

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:19.600
that they wanted to be perceived,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.031
so that the way they looked

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.974
and the names that they gave themselves

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:25.646
defined them.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:31.135
So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.

00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:35.147
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.

00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:37.859
Anxious is always anxious.

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:40.588
Clock has one arm longer than the other.

00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:44.236
(Laughter)

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:47.610
And my all-time favorite was the
guy they called Summerwear.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.444
When Summerwear came to this country

00:04:49.444 --> 00:04:51.563
from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted

00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:53.940
on wearing light summer suits,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.596
no matter the weather,

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:56.934
and in the course of researching their lives,

00:04:56.934 --> 00:04:59.910
I asked my mom, "Whatever
became of Summerwear?"

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.737
And she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.593
But men like Summerwear

00:05:06.593 --> 00:05:08.055
taught us the importance of style.

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:10.177
Maybe they exaggerated their style

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:13.393
because they thought that they were not considered

00:05:13.393 --> 00:05:15.497
to be quite civilized,

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.313
and they transferred that generational attitude

00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:20.913
or anxiety onto us, the next generation,

00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:23.100
so much so that when I was growing up,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.473
if ever on the television news or radio

00:05:25.473 --> 00:05:26.981
a report came up about a black person

00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:28.665
committing some crime —

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:32.329
a mugging, a murder, a burglary —

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:35.881
we winced along with our parents,

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:38.545
because they were letting the side down.

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:39.998
You did not just represent yourself.

00:05:39.998 --> 00:05:41.740
You represented the group,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.248
and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,

00:05:46.248 --> 00:05:48.512
in a way, that maybe you were going

00:05:48.512 --> 00:05:52.656
to be perceived in the same light.

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:56.428
So that was what needed to be challenged.

00:05:56.428 --> 00:06:00.709
Our father and many of his colleagues

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.170
exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.392
They were built to transmit but not receive.

00:06:06.392 --> 00:06:09.243
We were to keep quiet.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.596
When our father did speak to us,

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:13.461
it was from the pulpit of his mind.

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.049
They clung to certainty in the belief

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:19.178
that doubt would undermine them.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:22.769
But when I am working in my house

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:26.620
and writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.926
and I'm very excited to talk about
Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley

00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:32.790
and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.286
and I'm so excited that my children stop me,

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:38.966
and they say, "Dad, nobody cares."

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:42.956
(Laughter)

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:44.870
But they do care, actually.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.433
They cross over.

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:48.940
Somehow they find their way to you.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.544
They shape their lives according
to the narrative of your life,

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:56.570
as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.184
and maybe Bageye did with his father.

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.826
And that was clearer to me

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:03.784
in the course of looking at his life

00:07:03.784 --> 00:07:06.840
and understanding, as they say,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.152
the Native Americans say,

00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:09.781
"Do not criticize the man until you can walk

00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:12.093
in his moccasins."

00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:14.992
But in conjuring his life, it was okay

00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:18.260
and very straightforward to portray

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.240
a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.224
with bowls of plastic fruit,

00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:29.288
polystyrene ceiling tiles,

00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:31.576
settees permanently sheathed

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.948
in their transparent covers
that they were delivered in.

00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:36.800
But what's more difficult to navigate

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.292
is the emotional landscape

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.262
between the generations,

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:45.000
and the old adage that with age comes wisdom

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.045
is not true.

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:50.528
With age comes the veneer of respectability

00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:53.896
and a veneer of uncomfortable truths.

00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:56.668
But what was true was that my parents,

00:07:56.668 --> 00:07:59.144
my mother, and my father went along with it,

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:01.912
did not trust the state to educate me.

00:08:01.912 --> 00:08:04.402
So listen to how I sound.

00:08:04.402 --> 00:08:08.684
They determined that they would
send me to a private school,

00:08:08.684 --> 00:08:10.441
but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.

00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:14.232
It's quite difficult to fund a private school education

00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:16.872
and feed his army of children.

00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:18.856
I remember going on to the school

00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:20.980
for the entrance exam, and my father said

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.580
to the priest — it was a Catholic school —

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.807
he wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,

00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:31.735
but also, he, my father,

00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:34.375
never even managed to pass worms,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.995
never mind entrance exams.

00:08:36.995 --> 00:08:38.940
But in order to fund my education,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.663
he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.765
so my father would fund my education

00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:48.369
by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:49.801
and that was made even more tricky because

00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:51.961
my father, that's not his car by the way.

00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:53.769
My father aspired to have a car like that,

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:55.845
but my father had a beaten-up Mini,

00:08:55.845 --> 00:09:00.343
and he never, being a
Jamaican coming to this country,

00:09:00.343 --> 00:09:02.696
he never had a driving license,

00:09:02.696 --> 00:09:06.260
he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.199
He thought, "I know how to drive;

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:11.279
why do I need the state's validation?"

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.511
But it became a little tricky when
we were stopped by the police,

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.724
and we were stopped a lot by the police,

00:09:15.724 --> 00:09:16.941
and I was impressed by the way

00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:18.840
that my father dealt with the police.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.648
He would promote the policeman immediately,

00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:25.735
so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs

00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:26.919
in the course of the conversation

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.903
and wave us on merrily.

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:30.771
So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.953
called "playing fool to catch wise."

00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:38.322
But it lent also an idea

00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:40.128
that actually he was being diminished

00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:42.432
or belittled by the policeman —

00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:44.249
as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:46.820
but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.465
So on the one hand, there was

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.092
a mocking of authority,

00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:52.408
but on the other hand, there was a deference

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:54.229
towards authority,

00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:56.184
and these Caribbean people

00:09:56.184 --> 00:10:00.321
had an overbearing obedience towards authority,

00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:02.529
which is very striking, very strange in a way,

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:05.633
because migrants are very courageous people.

00:10:05.633 --> 00:10:08.393
They leave their homes. My father and my mother

00:10:08.393 --> 00:10:12.320
left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.144
and yet they were infantilized by travel.

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:17.912
They were timid,

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:19.361
and somewhere along the line,

00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:21.202
the natural order was reversed.

00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:24.689
The children became the parents to the parent.

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.143
The Caribbean people came to
this country with a five-year plan:

00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:31.142
they would work, some money, and then go back,

00:10:31.142 --> 00:10:33.965
but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:36.310
and before you know it,
you're changing the wallpaper,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.942
and at that point, you know you're here to stay.

00:10:39.942 --> 00:10:42.406
Although there's still the kind of temporariness

00:10:42.406 --> 00:10:44.853
that our parents felt about being here,

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:49.040
but we children knew that the game was up.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.798
I think there was a feeling that

00:10:51.798 --> 00:10:57.148
they would not be able to continue with the ideals

00:10:57.148 --> 00:10:59.155
of the life that they expected.

00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:01.137
The reality was very much different.

00:11:01.137 --> 00:11:03.211
And also, that was true of the reality

00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:04.629
of trying to educate me.

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:08.691
Having started the process,
my father did not continue.

00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.419
It was left to my mother to educate me,

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:14.140
and as George Lamming would say,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.919
it was my mother who fathered me.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.261
Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:

00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:21.948
You are being watched.

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:25.150
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.399
so much so that years later, when I was investigating

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.713
why so many young black men

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:30.844
were diagnosed with schizophrenia,

00:11:30.844 --> 00:11:33.351
six times more than they ought to be,

00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:36.623
I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,

00:11:36.623 --> 00:11:41.081
"Black people are schooled in paranoia."

00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:44.952
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:47.479
Now I also had a 10-year-old son,

00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:50.328
and turned my attention to Bageye

00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:51.704
and I went in search of him.

00:11:51.704 --> 00:11:55.306
He was back in Luton, he was now 82,

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:58.946
and I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,

00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:00.544
and when he opened the door,

00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:04.448
I saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,

00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:06.791
and he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.839
I was very disconcerted by that.

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:12.900
But we sat down, and he had
a Caribbean friend with him,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.455
talking some old time talk,

00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:17.929
and my father would look at me,

00:12:17.929 --> 00:12:19.583
and he looked at me as if I would

00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:23.227
miraculously disappear as I had arisen.

00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:25.463
And he turned to his friend, and he said,

00:12:25.463 --> 00:12:28.423
"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,

00:12:28.423 --> 00:12:31.383
deep, deep connection."

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:32.780
But I never felt that connection.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.559
If there was a pulse, it was very weak

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:38.383
or hardly at all.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.223
And I almost felt in the course of that reunion

00:12:40.223 --> 00:12:44.840
that I was auditioning to be my father's son.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.832
When the book came out,

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.568
it had fair reviews in the national papers,

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:51.840
but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.127
it's the Luton News,

00:12:54.127 --> 00:12:57.903
and the Luton News ran the headline about the book,

00:12:57.903 --> 00:13:03.122
"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."

00:13:03.122 --> 00:13:06.434
And I understood that could also represent

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:08.337
the rift between one generation and the next,

00:13:08.337 --> 00:13:12.341
between people like me and my father's generation,

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.589
but there's no tradition in Caribbean life

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:16.693
of memoirs or biographies.

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:20.777
It was a tradition that you didn't
chat about your business in public.

00:13:20.777 --> 00:13:25.433
But I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:27.329
there is a possibility that this

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:31.522
will open up conversations
that we'd never had before.

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:35.726
This will close the generation gap, perhaps.

00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:38.253
This could be an instrument of repair.

00:13:38.253 --> 00:13:40.654
And I even began to feel that this book

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:43.542
may be perceived by my father

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:47.718
as an act of filial devotion.

00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:51.453
Poor, deluded fool.

00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:55.494
Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be

00:13:55.494 --> 00:13:58.353
the public airing of his shortcomings.

00:13:58.353 --> 00:14:01.254
He was stung by my betrayal,

00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:03.326
and he went to the newspapers the next day

00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:04.510
and demanded a right of reply,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.742
and he got it with the headline

00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:09.902
"Bageye Bites Back."

00:14:09.902 --> 00:14:12.870
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.748
I was no son of his.

00:14:15.748 --> 00:14:17.829
He recognized in his mind that his colors

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:20.197
had been dragged through the
mud, and he couldn't allow that.

00:14:20.197 --> 00:14:22.782
He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,

00:14:22.782 --> 00:14:25.210
and initially, although I was disappointed,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.890
I grew to admire that stance.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.293
There was still fire bubbling through his veins,

00:14:30.293 --> 00:14:33.910
even though he was 82 years old.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.472
And if it meant that we would now return

00:14:36.472 --> 00:14:39.703
to 30 years of silence,

00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:45.663
my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."

00:14:45.663 --> 00:14:48.855
Jamaicans will tell you that
there's no such thing as facts,

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.880
there are only versions.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.361
We all tell ourselves the versions of the story

00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:56.216
that we can best live with.

00:14:56.216 --> 00:14:58.743
Each generation builds up an edifice

00:14:58.743 --> 00:15:00.810
which they are reluctant or sometimes unable

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.118
to disassemble,

00:15:03.118 --> 00:15:06.764
but in the writing, my version of the story

00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:08.832
began to change,

00:15:08.832 --> 00:15:12.826
and it was detached from me.

00:15:12.826 --> 00:15:15.755
I lost my hatred of my father.

00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:20.239
I did no longer want him to die or to murder him,

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:24.483
and I felt free,

00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:29.347
much freer than I'd ever felt before.

00:15:29.347 --> 00:15:31.227
And I wonder whether that freedness

00:15:31.227 --> 00:15:34.142
could be transferred to him.

00:15:36.218 --> 00:15:40.570
In that initial reunion,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.946
I was struck by an idea that I had

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:46.390
very few photographs of myself

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.764
as a young child.

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:50.954
This is a photograph of me,

00:15:50.954 --> 00:15:53.271
nine months old.

00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:55.193
In the original photograph,

00:15:55.193 --> 00:15:58.146
I'm being held up by my father, Bageye,

00:15:58.146 --> 00:16:00.390
but when my parents separated, my mother

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.160
excised him from all aspects of our lives.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.224
She took a pair of scissors and cut 
him out of every photograph,

00:16:07.224 --> 00:16:10.766
and for years, I told myself
the truth of this photograph

00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:13.770
was that you are alone,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.570
you are unsupported.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.842
But there's another way of looking at this photograph.

00:16:18.842 --> 00:16:21.418
This is a photograph that has the potential

00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:23.922
for a reunion,

00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:26.710
a potential to be reunited with my father,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.774
and in my yearning to be held up by my father,

00:16:30.774 --> 00:16:33.274
I held him up to the light.

00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:36.210
In that first reunion,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.512
it was very awkward and tense moments,

00:16:38.512 --> 00:16:39.854
and to lessen the tension,

00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:43.192
we decided to go for a walk.

00:16:43.192 --> 00:16:45.193
And as we walked, I was struck

00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:47.464
that I had reverted to being the child

00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:50.957
even though I was now towering above my father.

00:16:50.957 --> 00:16:53.208
I was almost a foot taller than my father.

00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:55.816
He was still the big man,

00:16:55.816 --> 00:17:00.537
and I tried to match his step.

00:17:00.537 --> 00:17:02.114
And I realized that he was walking

00:17:02.114 --> 00:17:04.890
as if he was still under observation,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.801
but I admired his walk.

00:17:07.801 --> 00:17:10.129
He walked like a man

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:13.000
on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.952
mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:20.576
There was dignity in defeat.

00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:22.993
Thank you.

00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:23.871
(Applause)
