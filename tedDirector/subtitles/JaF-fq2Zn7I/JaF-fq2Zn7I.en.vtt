00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:19.648
I'm going to talk today
about energy and climate.

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.141
And that might seem a bit surprising,

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.314
because my full-time work
at the foundation

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:27.373
is mostly about vaccines and seeds,

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:30.965
about the things that we need
to invent and deliver

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.496
to help the poorest two billion
live better lives.

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:40.236
But energy and climate
are extremely important to these people;

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.531
in fact, more important
than to anyone else on the planet.

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:50.764
The climate getting worse means
that many years, their crops won't grow:

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:53.819
there will be too much rain,
not enough rain;

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:59.780
things will change in ways their fragile
environment simply can't support.

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.433
And that leads to starvation, it leads
to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:07.266
So, the climate changes
will be terrible for them.

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:11.236
Also, the price of energy
is very important to them.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.538
In fact, if you could pick just one thing

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:18.294
to lower the price of to reduce poverty,
by far you would pick energy.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.875
Now, the price of energy
has come down over time.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:28.649
Really advanced civilization
is based on advances in energy.

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.609
The coal revolution fueled
the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.694
and, even in the 1900s,
we've seen a very rapid decline

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:38.236
in the price of electricity,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.642
and that's why we have
refrigerators, air-conditioning;

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.978
we can make modern materials
and do so many things.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:51.639
And so, we're in a wonderful situation
with electricity in the rich world.

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:55.423
But as we make it cheaper --
and let's say,

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.156
let's go for making it twice as cheap --

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:01.236
we need to meet a new constraint,

00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:05.979
and that constraint has to do with CO2.

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.072
CO2 is warming the planet,

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:14.236
and the equation on CO2
is actually a very straightforward one.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.199
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:21.236
that leads to a temperature increase,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.236
and that temperature increase
leads to some very negative effects:

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.173
the effects on the weather;
perhaps worse, the indirect effects,

00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:33.890
in that the natural ecosystems
can't adjust to these rapid changes,

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:36.157
and so you get ecosystem collapses.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.055
Now, the exact amount of how you map
from a certain increase of CO2

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.369
to what temperature will be,
and where the positive feedbacks are --

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:48.113
there's some uncertainty there,
but not very much.

00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:51.826
And there's certainly uncertainty
about how bad those effects will be,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.586
but they will be extremely bad.

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:56.763
I asked the top scientists
on this several times:

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:59.311
Do we really have to get
down to near zero?

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:02.368
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:06.236
And the answer is,
until we get near to zero,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.236
the temperature will continue to rise.

00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:10.488
And so that's a big challenge.

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.738
It's very different than saying,

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:16.098
"We're a twelve-foot-high truck
trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:18.505
and we can just sort of squeeze under."

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.852
This is something that has to get to zero.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:26.097
Now, we put out a lot
of carbon dioxide every year --

00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:28.224
over 26 billion tons.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:32.006
For each American, it's about 20 tons.

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:35.236
For people in poor countries,
it's less than one ton.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.920
It's an average of about five tons
for everyone on the planet.

00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:44.235
And somehow, we have to make changes
that will bring that down to zero.

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.021
It's been constantly going up.

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:51.650
It's only various economic changes
that have even flattened it at all,

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:55.131
so we have to go
from rapidly rising to falling,

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:57.237
and falling all the way to zero.

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:01.236
This equation has four factors,
a little bit of multiplication.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.024
So you've got a thing on the left,
CO2, that you want to get to zero,

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:08.438
and that's going to be based
on the number of people,

00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:11.852
the services each person
is using on average,

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.745
the energy, on average, for each service,

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.601
and the CO2 being put out
per unit of energy.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.945
So let's look at each one of these,

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.839
and see how we can get this down to zero.

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:28.050
Probably, one of these numbers is going
to have to get pretty near to zero.

00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:29.256
(Laughter)

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.254
That's back from high school algebra.

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:32.598
But let's take a look.

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.810
First, we've got population.

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.236
The world today has 6.8 billion people.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.463
That's headed up to about nine billion.

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:44.548
Now, if we do a really great job
on new vaccines,

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:47.029
health care, reproductive health services,

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:50.154
we could lower that by,
perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.

00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:53.969
But there, we see
an increase of about 1.3.

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:57.278
The second factor is the services we use.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.480
This encompasses everything:

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:03.677
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.674
These are very good things.

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.896
Getting rid of poverty means
providing these services

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.925
to almost everyone on the planet.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.236
And it's a great thing
for this number to go up.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.499
In the rich world, perhaps
the top one billion,

00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:19.908
we probably could cut back and use less,

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:24.048
but every year, this number,
on average, is going to go up,

00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:27.236
and so, overall,
that will more than double

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.699
the services delivered per person.

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:32.501
Here we have a very basic service:

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:35.937
Do you have lighting in your house
to be able to read your homework?

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:37.480
And, in fact, these kids don't,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.822
so they're going out and reading
their schoolwork

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:41.240
under the street lamps.

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:46.236
Now, efficiency, "E,"
the energy for each service --

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.237
here, finally we have some good news.

00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:50.123
We have something that's not going up.

00:05:50.147 --> 00:05:53.236
Through various inventions
and new ways of doing lighting,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.691
through different types of cars,
different ways of building buildings --

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:00.350
there are a lot of services

00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:03.714
where you can bring the energy
for that service down

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.236
quite substantially.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.755
Some individual services
even bring it down by 90 percent.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.125
There are other services,
like how we make fertilizer,

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:13.791
or how we do air transport,

00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:16.732
where the rooms for improvement
are far, far less.

00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:21.454
And so overall, if we're optimistic,
we may get a reduction

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:26.347
of a factor of three to even,
perhaps, a factor of six.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:29.236
But for these first three factors now,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.320
we've gone from 26 billion
to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:35.805
and that just won't cut it.

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.057
So let's look at this fourth factor --
this is going to be a key one --

00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:45.970
and this is the amount of CO2
put out per each unit of energy.

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:49.959
So the question is:
Can you actually get that to zero?

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:52.889
If you burn coal, no.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.388
If you burn natural gas, no.

00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:57.515
Almost every way
we make electricity today,

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:03.091
except for the emerging renewables
and nuclear, puts out CO2.

00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:06.804
And so, what we're going to have
to do at a global scale,

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:08.683
is create a new system.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:10.998
So we need energy miracles.

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:16.079
Now, when I use the term "miracle,"
I don't mean something that's impossible.

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:18.523
The microprocessor is a miracle.

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:20.532
The personal computer is a miracle.

00:07:20.556 --> 00:07:23.023
The Internet and its services
are a miracle.

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:27.662
So the people here have participated
in the creation of many miracles.

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:30.094
Usually, we don't have a deadline

00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:32.596
where you have to get the miracle
by a certain date.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.601
Usually, you just kind of stand by,
and some come along, some don't.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:40.724
This is a case where we actually
have to drive at full speed

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:44.739
and get a miracle
in a pretty tight timeline.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.694
Now, I thought, "How could
I really capture this?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.941
Is there some kind
of natural illustration,

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:54.835
some demonstration that would grab
people's imagination here?"

00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:59.236
I thought back to a year ago
when I brought mosquitoes,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.890
and somehow people enjoyed that.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.521
(Laughter)

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:07.591
It really got them involved
in the idea of, you know,

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:09.667
there are people who live with mosquitoes.

00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:13.305
With energy, all I could
come up with is this.

00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:17.235
I decided that releasing fireflies

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:20.892
would be my contribution
to the environment here this year.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.236
So here we have some natural fireflies.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.869
I'm told they don't bite; in fact,
they might not even leave that jar.

00:08:27.893 --> 00:08:29.465
(Laughter)

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:35.231
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky
solutions like that one,

00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.156
but they don't really add up to much.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.203
We need solutions, either one or several,

00:08:41.227 --> 00:08:46.738
that have unbelievable scale
and unbelievable reliability.

00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:50.736
And although there's many directions
that people are seeking,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.381
I really only see five
that can achieve the big numbers.

00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:59.148
I've left out tide,
geothermal, fusion, biofuels.

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.149
Those may make some contribution,

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.022
and if they can do better
than I expect, so much the better.

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:07.968
But my key point here
is that we're going to have to work on

00:09:07.992 --> 00:09:09.718
each of these five,

00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:13.539
and we can't give up any of them
because they look daunting,

00:09:13.563 --> 00:09:16.424
because they all have
significant challenges.

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:19.681
Let's look first at burning fossil fuels,

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:22.546
either burning coal
or burning natural gas.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:27.107
What you need to do there seems
like it might be simple, but it's not.

00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:29.564
And that's to take all the CO2,

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:32.236
after you've burned it,
going out the flue,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.405
pressurize it, create a liquid,
put it somewhere,

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:36.859
and hope it stays there.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.074
Now, we have some pilot things

00:09:39.098 --> 00:09:41.437
that do this at the 60 to 80
percent level.

00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.860
But getting up to that full percentage --
that will be very tricky.

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:51.456
And agreeing on where these CO2
quantities should be put will be hard,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.142
but the toughest one here
is this long-term issue:

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.706
Who's going to be sure?

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.328
Who's going to guarantee

00:09:57.352 --> 00:10:00.421
something that is literally
billions of times larger

00:10:00.445 --> 00:10:04.591
than any type of waste you think of
in terms of nuclear or other things?

00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:07.095
This is a lot of volume.

00:10:07.694 --> 00:10:08.900
So that's a tough one.

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:10.862
Next would be nuclear.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.236
It also has three big problems:

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.236
cost, particularly in highly
regulated countries, is high;

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.914
the issue of safety, really feeling good
about nothing could go wrong,

00:10:22.938 --> 00:10:25.942
that, even though you have
these human operators,

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:28.315
the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:30.671
And then what do you do with the waste?

00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:34.099
Although it's not very large,
there are a lot of concerns about that.

00:10:34.123 --> 00:10:35.788
People need to feel good about it.

00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:40.236
So three very tough problems
that might be solvable,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.843
and so, should be worked on.

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:45.140
The last three of the five,
I've grouped together.

00:10:45.164 --> 00:10:48.579
These are what people often refer to
as the renewable sources.

00:10:49.101 --> 00:10:53.124
And they actually -- although it's great
they don't require fuel --

00:10:53.148 --> 00:10:55.124
they have some disadvantages.

00:10:55.577 --> 00:11:01.419
One is that the density of energy
gathered in these technologies

00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:03.506
is dramatically less than a power plant.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.212
This is energy farming,

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:09.357
so you're talking about many square miles,
thousands of times more area

00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:11.885
than you think of
as a normal energy plant.

00:11:12.758 --> 00:11:15.346
Also, these are intermittent sources.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.785
The sun doesn't shine all day,
it doesn't shine every day,

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:21.236
and likewise, the wind
doesn't blow all the time.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.649
And so, if you depend on these sources,

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:26.023
you have to have some way
of getting the energy

00:11:26.047 --> 00:11:29.022
during those time periods
that it's not available.

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:32.043
So we've got big cost challenges here.

00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:34.396
We have transmission challenges;

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.984
for example, say this energy source
is outside your country,

00:11:38.008 --> 00:11:40.101
you not only need the technology,

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:44.498
but you have to deal with the risk
of the energy coming from elsewhere.

00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:46.431
And, finally, this storage problem.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.561
To dimensionalize this,

00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:52.138
I went through and looked
at all the types of batteries made --

00:11:52.162 --> 00:11:56.674
for cars, for computers, for phones,
for flashlights, for everything --

00:11:56.698 --> 00:12:01.192
and compared that to the amount
of electrical energy the world uses.

00:12:01.644 --> 00:12:05.237
What I found is that all
the batteries we make now

00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.488
could store less than 10 minutes
of all the energy.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.628
And so, in fact, we need
a big breakthrough here,

00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:16.520
something that's going to be
a factor of 100 better

00:12:16.544 --> 00:12:18.377
than the approaches we have now.

00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:22.166
It's not impossible,
but it's not a very easy thing.

00:12:22.594 --> 00:12:26.236
Now, this shows up when you try
to get the intermittent source

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.412
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent
of what you're using.

00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:33.030
If you're counting on it for 100 percent,

00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:36.713
you need an incredible miracle battery.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.877
Now, how are we going to go forward
on this -- what's the right approach?

00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:45.480
Is it a Manhattan Project?
What's the thing that can get us there?

00:12:45.504 --> 00:12:50.315
Well, we need lots of companies
working on this -- hundreds.

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:53.918
In each of these five paths,
we need at least a hundred people.

00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:56.652
A lot of them, you'll look at
and say, "They're crazy."

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:57.857
That's good.

00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:00.811
And, I think, here in the TED group,

00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:04.046
we have many people
who are already pursuing this.

00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:08.236
Bill Gross has several companies,
including one called eSolar

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.042
that has some great
solar thermal technologies.

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:14.516
Vinod Khosla is investing
in dozens of companies

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.467
that are doing great things
and have interesting possibilities,

00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.640
and I'm trying to help back that.

00:13:20.664 --> 00:13:24.236
Nathan Myhrvold and I
actually are backing a company

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.032
that, perhaps surprisingly,
is actually taking the nuclear approach.

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:31.994
There are some innovations
in nuclear: modular, liquid.

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:36.431
Innovation really stopped
in this industry quite some ago,

00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:39.550
so the idea that there's some
good ideas laying around

00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:41.299
is not all that surprising.

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:47.579
The idea of TerraPower is that,
instead of burning a part of uranium --

00:13:47.603 --> 00:13:50.722
the one percent, which is the U235 --

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:54.462
we decided, "Let's burn
the 99 percent, the U238."

00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:57.351
It is kind of a crazy idea.

00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:00.518
In fact, people had talked
about it for a long time,

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:04.703
but they could never simulate properly
whether it would work or not,

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:07.592
and so it's through the advent
of modern supercomputers

00:14:07.616 --> 00:14:09.747
that now you can simulate
and see that, yes,

00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:14.979
with the right materials approach,
this looks like it would work.

00:14:15.453 --> 00:14:18.236
And because you're burning
that 99 percent,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.643
you have greatly improved cost profile.

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:26.877
You actually burn up the waste,
and you can actually use as fuel

00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:29.926
all the leftover waste
from today's reactors.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.741
So instead of worrying about them,
you just take that, it's a great thing.

00:14:34.088 --> 00:14:38.583
It breeds this uranium as it goes along,
so it's kind of like a candle.

00:14:38.607 --> 00:14:42.339
You see it's a log there, often
referred to as a traveling wave reactor.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.679
In terms of fuel,
this really solves the problem.

00:14:46.703 --> 00:14:49.604
I've got a picture here
of a place in Kentucky.

00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:51.828
This is the leftover, the 99 percent,

00:14:51.852 --> 00:14:54.082
where they've taken out
the part they burn now,

00:14:54.106 --> 00:14:55.676
so it's called depleted uranium.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.547
That would power the US
for hundreds of years.

00:14:58.571 --> 00:15:02.106
And simply by filtering seawater
in an inexpensive process,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.939
you'd have enough fuel for the entire
lifetime of the rest of the planet.

00:15:06.314 --> 00:15:10.375
So, you know, it's got lots
of challenges ahead,

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:15.794
but it is an example of the many
hundreds and hundreds of ideas

00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:17.677
that we need to move forward.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.365
So let's think: How should
we measure ourselves?

00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:24.236
What should our report card look like?

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:27.140
Well, let's go out to where
we really need to get,

00:15:27.164 --> 00:15:29.307
and then look at the intermediate.

00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:34.353
For 2050, you've heard many people
talk about this 80 percent reduction.

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:38.154
That really is very important,
that we get there.

00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:42.599
And that 20 percent will be used up
by things going on in poor countries --

00:15:42.623 --> 00:15:48.017
still some agriculture; hopefully,
we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.

00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:51.030
So, to get to that 80 percent,

00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:55.559
the developed countries,
including countries like China,

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:59.982
will have had to switch
their electricity generation altogether.

00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:06.236
The other grade is: Are we deploying
this zero-emission technology,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.657
have we deployed it
in all the developed countries

00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:11.468
and are in the process
of getting it elsewhere?

00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:13.236
That's super important.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.599
That's a key element
of making that report card.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.565
Backing up from there, what should
the 2020 report card look like?

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.333
Well, again, it should have
the two elements.

00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:28.496
We should go through these efficiency
measures to start getting reductions:

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.784
The less we emit,
the less that sum will be of CO2,

00:16:31.808 --> 00:16:33.880
and therefore, the less the temperature.

00:16:33.904 --> 00:16:36.833
But in some ways, the grade we get there,

00:16:36.857 --> 00:16:41.101
doing things that don't get us
all the way to the big reductions,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.969
is only equally, or maybe even slightly
less, important than the other,

00:16:44.993 --> 00:16:48.749
which is the piece of innovation
on these breakthroughs.

00:16:48.773 --> 00:16:52.011
These breakthroughs,
we need to move those at full speed,

00:16:52.035 --> 00:16:54.460
and we can measure that
in terms of companies,

00:16:54.484 --> 00:16:57.378
pilot projects, regulatory things
that have been changed.

00:16:57.858 --> 00:17:00.832
There's a lot of great books
that have been written about this.

00:17:00.856 --> 00:17:03.236
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice,"

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.840
and the David MacKay book,
"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."

00:17:06.864 --> 00:17:10.040
They really go through it
and create a framework

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:11.897
that this can be discussed broadly,

00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:13.878
because we need broad backing for this.

00:17:14.246 --> 00:17:16.473
There's a lot that has to come together.

00:17:16.497 --> 00:17:17.979
So this is a wish.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:22.180
It's a very concrete wish
that we invent this technology.

00:17:22.632 --> 00:17:25.721
If you gave me only one wish
for the next 50 years --

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:27.722
I could pick who's president,

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.508
I could pick a vaccine,
which is something I love,

00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:32.589
or I could pick that this thing

00:17:32.613 --> 00:17:36.074
that's half the cost with no CO2
gets invented --

00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:38.005
this is the wish I would pick.

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:40.114
This is the one with the greatest impact.

00:17:40.138 --> 00:17:41.783
If we don't get this wish,

00:17:41.807 --> 00:17:45.245
the division between the people
who think short term and long term

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:46.427
will be terrible,

00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:49.395
between the US and China,
between poor countries and rich,

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:50.613
and most of all,

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:53.701
the lives of those two billion
will be far worse.

00:17:54.418 --> 00:17:56.236
So what do we have to do?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.084
What am I appealing to you
to step forward and drive?

00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:04.030
We need to go for more research funding.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.075
When countries get together
in places like Copenhagen,

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:09.518
they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.

00:18:09.542 --> 00:18:11.909
They should discuss
this innovation agenda.

00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:16.236
You'd be stunned at the ridiculously
low levels of spending

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.975
on these innovative approaches.

00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:22.236
We do need the market incentives --
CO2 tax, cap and trade --

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.784
something that gets
that price signal out there.

00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:26.739
We need to get the message out.

00:18:26.763 --> 00:18:29.167
We need to have this dialogue
be a more rational,

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.781
more understandable dialogue,

00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:33.336
including the steps
that the government takes.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.010
This is an important wish,
but it is one I think we can achieve.

00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:38.829
Thank you.

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:45.853
(Applause)

00:18:48.235 --> 00:18:50.236
(Applause ends)

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.476
Thank you.

00:18:52.563 --> 00:18:54.408
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:54.432 --> 00:18:59.493
(Applause)

00:18:59.517 --> 00:19:01.015
CA: Thank you.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:05.101
So to understand more about TerraPower.

00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:09.653
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense
of what scale of investment this is?

00:19:10.158 --> 00:19:14.492
Bill Gates: To actually do the software,
buy the supercomputer,

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:16.845
hire all the great scientists,
which we've done,

00:19:16.869 --> 00:19:19.126
that's only tens of millions.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.098
And even once we test our materials out
in a Russian reactor

00:19:23.122 --> 00:19:26.297
to make sure our materials work properly,

00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:28.838
then you'll only be up
in the hundreds of millions.

00:19:28.862 --> 00:19:31.220
The tough thing
is building the pilot reactor --

00:19:31.244 --> 00:19:36.048
finding the several billion,
finding the regulator, the location

00:19:36.072 --> 00:19:38.331
that will actually build
the first one of these.

00:19:38.355 --> 00:19:42.517
Once you get the first one built,
if it works as advertised,

00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:43.891
then it's just clear as day,

00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:47.111
because the economics,
the energy density, are so different

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:48.549
than nuclear as we know it.

00:19:48.573 --> 00:19:50.035
CA: So to understand it right,

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:52.341
this involves building
deep into the ground,

00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:57.925
almost like a vertical column
of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,

00:19:57.949 --> 00:20:01.089
and then the process starts
at the top and kind of works down?

00:20:01.113 --> 00:20:02.290
BG: That's right.

00:20:02.314 --> 00:20:04.373
Today, you're always
refueling the reactor,

00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:07.589
so you have lots of people and lots
of controls that can go wrong,

00:20:07.613 --> 00:20:10.352
where you're opening it up
and moving things in and out --

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.533
that's not good.

00:20:12.557 --> 00:20:13.730
So if you have very --

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:14.843
(Laughter)

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:17.614
very cheap fuel
that you can put 60 years in --

00:20:17.638 --> 00:20:19.192
just think of it as a log --

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:22.754
put it down and not have
those same complexities.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:27.683
And it just sits there and burns
for the 60 years, and then it's done.

00:20:27.707 --> 00:20:31.645
CA: It's a nuclear power plant
that is its own waste disposal solution.

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:33.563
BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,

00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:38.967
you can let it sit there -- there's a lot
less waste under this approach --

00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:40.627
then you can actually take that

00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:43.236
and put it into another one and burn that.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.466
And we start out, actually,
by taking the waste that exists today

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.722
that's sitting in these cooling pools
or dry-casking by reactors --

00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:53.898
that's our fuel to begin with.

00:20:53.922 --> 00:20:56.529
So the thing that's been a problem
from those reactors

00:20:56.553 --> 00:20:58.480
is actually what gets fed into ours,

00:20:58.504 --> 00:21:01.491
and you're reducing the volume
of the waste quite dramatically

00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:03.492
as you're going through this process.

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.091
CA: You're talking
to different people around the world

00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:07.404
about the possibilities.

00:21:07.428 --> 00:21:10.836
Where is there most interest
in actually doing something with this?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.015
BG: Well, we haven't picked
a particular place,

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:18.499
and there's all these interesting
disclosure rules

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:20.999
about anything that's called "nuclear."

00:21:21.023 --> 00:21:23.952
So we've got a lot of interest.

00:21:23.976 --> 00:21:27.051
People from the company
have been in Russia, India, China.

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:29.689
I've been back seeing
the secretary of energy here,

00:21:29.713 --> 00:21:33.045
talking about how this fits
into the energy agenda.

00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:34.645
So I'm optimistic.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.846
The French and Japanese
have done some work.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.530
This is a variant on something
that has been done.

00:21:40.554 --> 00:21:44.236
It's an important advance,
but it's like a fast reactor,

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.236
and a lot of countries have built them,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.834
so anybody who's done
a fast reactor is a candidate

00:21:48.858 --> 00:21:51.236
to be where the first one gets built.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.702
CA: So, in your mind,

00:21:54.726 --> 00:21:59.484
timescale and likelihood of actually
taking something like this live?

00:21:59.508 --> 00:22:05.595
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these
high-scale, electro-generation things

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:06.777
that's very cheap,

00:22:06.801 --> 00:22:10.479
we have 20 years to invent
and then 20 years to deploy.

00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:12.259
That's sort of the deadline

00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:17.541
that the environmental models
have shown us that we have to meet.

00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:22.977
And TerraPower -- if things go well,
which is wishing for a lot --

00:22:23.001 --> 00:22:24.644
could easily meet that.

00:22:24.668 --> 00:22:27.940
And there are, fortunately
now, dozens of companies --

00:22:27.964 --> 00:22:29.315
we need it to be hundreds --

00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:31.556
who, likewise, if their science goes well,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.475
if the funding for their pilot
plants goes well,

00:22:34.499 --> 00:22:36.525
that they can compete for this.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:38.523
And it's best if multiple succeed,

00:22:38.547 --> 00:22:41.236
because then you could use
a mix of these things.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.341
We certainly need one to succeed.

00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:46.324
CA: In terms of big-scale
possible game changers,

00:22:46.348 --> 00:22:49.082
is this the biggest
that you're aware of out there?

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:53.455
BG: An energy breakthrough
is the most important thing.

00:22:53.479 --> 00:22:56.462
It would have been, even
without the environmental constraint,

00:22:56.486 --> 00:23:00.349
but the environmental constraint
just makes it so much greater.

00:23:00.373 --> 00:23:03.697
In the nuclear space,
there are other innovators.

00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:06.711
You know, we don't know their work
as well as we know this one,

00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:09.992
but the modular people,
that's a different approach.

00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:13.621
There's a liquid-type reactor,
which seems a little hard,

00:23:13.645 --> 00:23:15.881
but maybe they say that about us.

00:23:15.905 --> 00:23:18.236
And so, there are different ones,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.236
but the beauty of this
is a molecule of uranium

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.350
has a million times as much energy
as a molecule of, say, coal.

00:23:25.962 --> 00:23:28.978
And so, if you can
deal with the negatives,

00:23:29.002 --> 00:23:32.854
which are essentially the radiation,
the footprint and cost,

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:36.869
the potential, in terms of effect
on land and various things,

00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:40.236
is almost in a class of its own.

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:44.938
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?

00:23:44.962 --> 00:23:48.236
Do we have to start taking
emergency measures

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.358
to try and keep the temperature
of the earth stable?

00:23:51.382 --> 00:23:53.236
BG: If you get into that situation,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.236
it's like if you've been overeating,
and you're about to have a heart attack.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.785
Then where do you go?

00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:02.742
You may need heart surgery or something.

00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:06.636
There is a line of research
on what's called geoengineering,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.637
which are various techniques
that would delay the heating

00:24:09.661 --> 00:24:12.947
to buy us 20 or 30 years
to get our act together.

00:24:12.971 --> 00:24:16.579
Now, that's just an insurance policy;
you hope you don't need to do that.

00:24:16.603 --> 00:24:19.645
Some people say you shouldn't even
work on the insurance policy

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:21.190
because it might make you lazy,

00:24:21.214 --> 00:24:25.080
that you'll keep eating because you know
heart surgery will be there to save you.

00:24:25.104 --> 00:24:28.221
I'm not sure that's wise,
given the importance of the problem,

00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:31.346
but there's now
the geoengineering discussion

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.577
about: Should that be in the back
pocket in case things happen faster,

00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:39.088
or this innovation goes
a lot slower than we expect?

00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:42.610
CA: Climate skeptics:

00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:46.140
If you had a sentence or two
to say to them,

00:24:46.164 --> 00:24:49.773
how might you persuade them
that they're wrong?

00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:53.956
BG: Well, unfortunately,
the skeptics come in different camps.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.421
The ones who make scientific
arguments are very few.

00:24:58.445 --> 00:25:01.434
Are they saying there's negative
feedback effects

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.660
that have to do with clouds
that offset things?

00:25:03.684 --> 00:25:06.992
There are very, very few things
that they can even say

00:25:07.016 --> 00:25:09.663
there's a chance
in a million of those things.

00:25:09.687 --> 00:25:12.891
The main problem we have here --
it's kind of like with AIDS:

00:25:12.915 --> 00:25:16.718
you make the mistake now,
and you pay for it a lot later.

00:25:16.742 --> 00:25:19.997
And so, when you have
all sorts of urgent problems,

00:25:20.021 --> 00:25:24.082
the idea of taking pain now
that has to do with a gain later,

00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:26.392
and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:32.504
In fact, the IPCC report --
that's not necessarily the worst case,

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:36.603
and there are people in the rich world
who look at IPCC and say,

00:25:36.627 --> 00:25:38.411
"OK, that isn't that big of a deal."

00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:42.584
The fact is it's that uncertain part
that should move us towards this.

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.240
But my dream here is that,

00:25:44.264 --> 00:25:47.924
if you can make it economic,
and meet the CO2 constraints,

00:25:47.948 --> 00:25:49.107
then the skeptics say,

00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:51.411
"OK, I don't care
that it doesn't put out CO2,

00:25:51.435 --> 00:25:53.115
I kind of wish it did put out CO2.

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:54.495
But I guess I'll accept it,

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.236
because it's cheaper
than what's come before."

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.091
(Applause)

00:26:02.115 --> 00:26:05.295
CA: So that would be your response
to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,

00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:09.775
basically if you spend all this energy
trying to solve the CO2 problem,

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:11.893
it's going to take away
all your other goals

00:26:11.917 --> 00:26:14.910
of trying to rid the world
of poverty and malaria and so forth,

00:26:14.934 --> 00:26:17.167
it's a stupid waste
of the Earth's resources

00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:18.464
to put money towards that

00:26:18.488 --> 00:26:20.406
when there are better things we can do.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.821
BG: Well, the actual
spending on the R&amp;D piece --

00:26:23.845 --> 00:26:27.341
say the US should spend 10 billion a year
more than it is right now --

00:26:27.365 --> 00:26:29.236
it's not that dramatic.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.236
It shouldn't take away from other things.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.680
The thing you get into big money on,
and reasonable people can disagree,

00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:36.870
is when you have something
that's non-economic

00:26:36.894 --> 00:26:38.513
and you're trying to fund that --

00:26:38.537 --> 00:26:40.465
that, to me, mostly is a waste.

00:26:40.489 --> 00:26:42.036
Unless you're very close,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.704
and you're just funding the learning curve
and it's going to get very cheap,

00:26:45.728 --> 00:26:48.526
I believe we should try more things

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.236
that have a potential
to be far less expensive.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.452
If the trade-off you get into is,
"Let's make energy super expensive,"

00:26:56.476 --> 00:26:58.498
then the rich can afford that.

00:26:58.522 --> 00:27:01.651
I mean, all of us here could pay
five times as much for our energy

00:27:01.675 --> 00:27:03.066
and not change our lifestyle.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.354
The disaster is for that two billion.

00:27:05.378 --> 00:27:07.685
And even Lomborg has changed.

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:12.236
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;D
getting more discussed?"

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.773
He's still, because of his earlier stuff,

00:27:14.797 --> 00:27:16.697
still associated with the skeptic camp,

00:27:16.721 --> 00:27:19.494
but he's realized
that's a pretty lonely camp,

00:27:19.518 --> 00:27:22.776
and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.236
And so there is a thread of something
that I think is appropriate.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.236
The R&amp;D piece --
it's crazy how little it's funded.

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:34.103
CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak
on behalf of most people here

00:27:34.127 --> 00:27:36.195
to say I really hope your wish comes true.

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.391
Thank you so much.

00:27:37.415 --> 00:27:38.566
BG: Thank you.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:43.982
(Applause)
