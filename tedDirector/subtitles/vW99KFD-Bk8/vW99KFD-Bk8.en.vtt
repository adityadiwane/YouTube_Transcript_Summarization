00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want you to put off your preconceptions,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.260
your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And by the way, if I come across as a sort of

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
rabid, hippie conservationist,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
it's purely a figment of your imagination.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
(Laughter)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.260
to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.260
of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And, of course, watch it fall from the sky

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and flow in our wonderful rivers,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
but for several other reasons as well.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
When I was a kid, growing up in New York,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.260
smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And my mother, brave lady,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
was partly to blame,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
buying me books on snakes,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and then starting this infamous career of mine,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
which has culminated in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
brought by my mother, Doris Norden,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
It's been a roller coaster ride.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Two animals, two iconic reptiles

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
really captivated me very early on.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
One of them was the remarkable gharial.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
in the northern rivers,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
What my purpose of the talk today really is,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
is to sort of indelibly scar your minds

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
with these charismatic and majestic creatures.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Because this is what you will take away from here,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
a reconnection with nature, I hope.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
What you're seeing here is very recently shot images

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in a forest nearby here,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
of a female king cobra making her nest.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and then laying her eggs inside,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and hatch into little baby king cobras.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So, she protects her eggs,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and after three months,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the babies finally do hatch out.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.260
in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
My first experience with king cobras was in '72

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at a magical place called Agumbe,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
in Karnataka, this state.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And it is a marvelous rain forest.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
This first encounter

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
was kind of like the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It really changed my life totally.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
I ended up starting this research

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and education station in Agumbe,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
which you are all of course invited to visit.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is basically a base wherein

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
we are trying to gather and learn

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
virtually everything about the biodiversity

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
of this incredibly complex forest system,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and try to hang on to what's there,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and of course, having a good time too.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
You can almost hear the drums

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
It was very important for us to get through to the people.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And through the children is usually the way to go.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that steely thing that you end up

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
They are interested.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And it really works to start with them.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and was hanging around there for two or three days.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
The people of this part of India

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
worship the king cobra.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
over the last three years,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and relocated them in nearby forests.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
[it was necessary] for us to actually insert

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
where the babies go after they hatch,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and remarkable things like this you're about to see.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
who had caught a venomous pit viper.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And king cobras feed only on snakes.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
what we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
(Laughter)

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Usually they eat something a bit larger.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.260
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
activity happened over the last breeding season,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
We're still trying to explain and come to terms with

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.260
what is the evolutionary advantage of this.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
It's just a wresting match,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
but a remarkable activity.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Now, what are we doing with all this information?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
What's the point of all this?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Well, the king cobra is literally

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
a keystone species in these rainforests.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And our job is to convince the authorities

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that these forests have to be protected.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And this is one of the ways we do it,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
by learning as much as we can

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.260
about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
in order to help protect trees, animals

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and of course the water sources.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
which started back in the early '70s,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260
which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
We were piloted, I could say,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
by a highly autocratic stateswoman,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.260
but who also had an incredible passion for environment.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And, just like Project Tiger,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
our activities with the king cobra

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
is to look at a species of animal

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So, the tiger is the icon.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And now the king cobra is a new one.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
All the major rivers in south India

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
are sourced in the Western Ghats,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.260
the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
It pours out millions of gallons every hour,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and washes many, many babies,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and of course feeds many, many animals,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
both domestic and wild,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
produces thousands of tons of rice.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
You drink it in peril of your life.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
It's not misguided river engineers

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
who are doing all this; it's us.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.260
It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
are in water sources.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
North central India, the Chambal River

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
is where we have our base.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.260
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It is an animal which has been on the Earth

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
for just about 100 million years.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
It has remarkable features.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Even though it grows to 20 feet long,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
It does have big teeth, however,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and it's kind of hard to convince people

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.260
But we, actually, back in the early '70s,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
did surveys,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and found that gharial were extremely rare.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
In fact, if you see the map,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
the range of their original habitat

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to the Irrawaddy in Burma.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
in Nepal and India.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
So, in fact at this point

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
So, starting in the mid-'70s

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
when conservation was at the fore,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
we were actually able to start projects which were

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
basically government supported

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and release 5,000 baby gharial

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
back to the wild.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
basking on the river again.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.260
But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
like sand mining, for example,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
not allowing the animals to breed anymore,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
we're looking at

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
even more problems building up for the gharial,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
despite the early good intentions.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Their nests hatching along the riverside

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
This was actually just taken last year.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
But then the monsoon arrives,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
there is always a barrage,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Luckily there is still a lot of interest.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
the World Wildlife Fund,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.260
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.260
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Why? How could it happen?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
This is a relatively clean river.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
we got veterinarians from all over the world

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
And we actually looked through

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And it came down to something called gout,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
which, as a result of kidney breakdown

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
and worse in the joints,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
which made the gharial unable to swim.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And it's a horribly painful death.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Just downriver from the Chambal is the

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
was something in the food chain,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
something in the fish they were eating.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
everything is affected, including us.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
In order to try to answer some of these questions,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
we again turn to technology,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
to biological technology, in this case,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260
again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and actually following their movements. They're being watched

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
everyday as we speak, to try to find out

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
what this mysterious toxin is.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
about the bandits, the dacoits

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.260
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
This is one of the last repositories of the

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Ganges river dolphin,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
various species of turtles,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
thousands of migratory birds,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and fishing is causing problems like this.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And now [these] new elements of human intolerance

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
for river creatures like the gharial

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
means that if they don't drown in the net,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
then they simply cut their beaks off.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
which is just down to a few left,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and it is also critically endangered.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
So, who is next? Us?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Because we are all dependent on these water sources.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
So, we all know about the Narmada river,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
which displace people and wreck river systems

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
without providing livelihoods.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And development just basically going berserk,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
for a double figure growth index, basically.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
whether it's got a happy or sad ending.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And climate change is certainly going

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
We're still working hard at it.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And the thing is, you know, the decision makers,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
the folks in power,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
But out on the rivers there are still millions of people

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
who are in really bad shape.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
And it's a bleak future for them.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and nothing to show for it. Incredible.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So, people talk about political will.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Government cut through all the red tape,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
we got foreign vets on it. It was great.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
So, we can do it.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
or to the Gomati in Lucknow,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
or to the Adyar river in Chennai,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.260
just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
But I think the final note really is

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
that we can do it.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
the good old everyday folks

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
can actually bring these rivers back.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And the final word is

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.260
that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
And these are powerful water totems.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
Namaste.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:36.260
(Applause)

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
You know, most people are terrified of snakes.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
And there might be quite a few people here who would be

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Do you have those conversations with people?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
How do you really get them to care?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.260
I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
It's not like the teddy bear.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260
But I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
And when the average person looks at a cobra

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
going "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
look at that angry, dangerous creature."

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
of something so dangerous as a human being.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.260
(Applause)

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
CA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
or even cobras.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Whereas other king cobras

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
very often come into the human interface,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
This guy specializes in pit vipers.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
And the guy who is working there with them,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
(Laughter)

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
Now, the nusha means the high.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Laughter)

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
(Applause)
