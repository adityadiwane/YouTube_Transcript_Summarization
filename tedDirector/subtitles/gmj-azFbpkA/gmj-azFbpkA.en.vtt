00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.616
So a while ago, I tried an experiment.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.080
For one year, I would say yes
to all the things that scared me.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.056
Anything that made me nervous,
took me out of my comfort zone,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840
I forced myself to say yes to.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.015
Did I want to speak in public?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.720
No, but yes.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.176
Did I want to be on live TV?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
No, but yes.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.296
Did I want to try acting?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.376
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.456
And a crazy thing happened:

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.216
the very act of doing
the thing that scared me

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.896
undid the fear,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.456
made it not scary.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.920
My fear of public speaking,
my social anxiety, poof, gone.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.576
It's amazing, the power of one word.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.736
"Yes" changed my life.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.456
"Yes" changed me.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.856
But there was one particular yes

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.816
that affected my life
in the most profound way,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.656
in a way I never imagined,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.320
and it started with a question
from my toddler.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.736
I have these three amazing daughters,
Harper, Beckett and Emerson,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.256
and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably
refers to everyone as "honey."

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.136
as though she's a Southern waitress.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.376
(Laughter)

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.216
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk
for my sippy cup."

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.856
(Laughter)

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.136
The Southern waitress asked me
to play with her one evening

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.936
when I was on my way somewhere,
and I said, "Yes."

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.976
And that yes was the beginning
of a new way of life for my family.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.976
I made a vow that from now on,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.336
every time one of my children
asks me to play,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.896
no matter what I'm doing
or where I'm going,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.520
I say yes, every single time.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.896
Almost. I'm not perfect at it,
but I try hard to practice it.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.336
And it's had a magical effect on me,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.760
on my children, on our family.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.456
But it's also had a stunning side effect,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.056
and it wasn't until recently
that I fully understood it,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.656
that I understood that saying yes
to playing with my children

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.840
likely saved my career.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.896
See, I have what most people
would call a dream job.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.696
I'm a writer. I imagine.
I make stuff up for a living.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.176
Dream job.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.536
No.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.760
I'm a titan.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.656
Dream job.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.136
I create television.
I executive produce television.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.256
I make television,
a great deal of television.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.136
In one way or another, this TV season,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.696
I'm responsible for bringing about
70 hours of programming to the world.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.776
Four television programs,
70 hours of TV --

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.816
(Applause)

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.296
Three shows in production
at a time, sometimes four.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.656
Each show creates hundreds of jobs
that didn't exist before.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.936
The budget for one episode
of network television

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.336
can be anywhere
from three to six million dollars.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.616
Let's just say five.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.096
A new episode made every nine days
times four shows,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.176
so every nine days that's
20 million dollars worth of television,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.176
four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.656
three shows in production at a time,
sometimes four,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.376
16 episodes going on at all times:

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.776
24 episodes of "Grey's,"
21 episodes of "Scandal,"

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.056
15 episodes of
"How To Get Away With Murder,"

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.456
10 episodes of "The Catch,"
that's 70 hours of TV,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.416
that's 350 million dollars for a season.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.976
In America, my television shows

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.016
are back to back to back
on Thursday night.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.816
Around the world, my shows air
in 256 territories in 67 languages

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.656
for an audience of 30 million people.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.360
My brain is global,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.216
and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV
are shows I personally created

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.696
and not just produced,
so on top of everything else,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.256
I need to find time,
real quiet, creative time,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.456
to gather my fans around the campfire

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.720
and tell my stories.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.113
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:03:34.137 --> 00:03:35.856
three shows in production at a time,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.920
sometimes four, 350 million dollars,
campfires burning all over the world.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.200
You know who else is doing that?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.536
Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.816
Dream job.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.056
(Applause)

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.336
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.496
I tell you this because I know what you
think of when you hear the word "writer."

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.425
I tell you this so that all of you
out there who work so hard,

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.856
whether you run a company
or a country or a classroom

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.376
or a store or a home,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.096
take me seriously
when I talk about working,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.096
so you'll get that I don't
peck at a computer and imagine all day,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.016
so you'll hear me when I say

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.520
that I understand that a dream job
is not about dreaming.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.416
It's all job, all work, all reality,
all blood, all sweat, no tears.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.240
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.176
When I'm hard at work,
when I'm deep in it,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.696
there is no other feeling.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.176
For me, my work is at all times
building a nation out of thin air.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.976
It is manning the troops.
It is painting a canvas.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.656
It is hitting every high note.
It is running a marathon.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.296
It is being BeyoncÃ©.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.240
And it is all of those things
at the same time.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.576
I love working.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.656
It is creative and mechanical
and exhausting and exhilarating

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.256
and hilarious and disturbing
and clinical and maternal

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.656
and cruel and judicious,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.760
and what makes it all so good is the hum.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.856
There is some kind of shift inside me
when the work gets good.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.776
A hum begins in my brain,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.496
and it grows and it grows
and that hum sounds like the open road,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520
and I could drive it forever.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.781
And a lot of people,
when I try to explain the hum,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.736
they assume that I'm talking
about the writing,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.216
that my writing brings me joy.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.560
And don't get me wrong, it does.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.600
But the hum --

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.656
it wasn't until I started
making television

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.896
that I started working, working and making

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.536
and building and creating
and collaborating,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.000
that I discovered this thing,
this buzz, this rush, this hum.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.816
The hum is more than writing.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.096
The hum is action and activity.
The hum is a drug.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.736
The hum is music.
The hum is light and air.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.120
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.400
And when you have a hum like that,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.656
you can't help but strive for greatness.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.280
That feeling, you can't help
but strive for greatness at any cost.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.320
That's called the hum.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.696
Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.376
(Laughter)

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.200
Maybe it's called genius.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.800
Maybe it's called ego.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.760
Maybe it's just fear of failure.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.296
I don't know.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.136
I just know that
I'm not built for failure,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.000
and I just know that I love the hum.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.096
I just know that I want
to tell you I'm a titan,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.576
and I know that
I don't want to question it.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.800
But here's the thing:

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.896
the more successful I become,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.536
the more shows, the more episodes,
the more barriers broken,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.040
the more work there is to do,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.016
the more balls in the air,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.936
the more eyes on me,
the more history stares,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.720
the more expectations there are.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.376
The more I work to be successful,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.760
the more I need to work.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.656
And what did I say about work?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.000
I love working, right?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.016
The nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.256
the troops, the canvas,
the high note, the hum,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.136
the hum, the hum.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.216
I like that hum. I love that hum.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.040
I need that hum. I am that hum.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.600
Am I nothing but that hum?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.760
And then the hum stopped.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.096
Overworked, overused,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.416
overdone, burned out.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.640
The hum stopped.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.656
Now, my three daughters
are used to the truth

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.800
that their mother
is a single working titan.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.776
Harper tells people,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.640
"My mom won't be there,
but you can text my nanny."

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.760
And Emerson says, "Honey,
I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.056
They're children of a titan.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.880
They're baby titans.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.800
They were 12, 3, and 1
when the hum stopped.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.160
The hum of the engine died.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.296
I stopped loving work.
I couldn't restart the engine.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.296
The hum would not come back.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.640
My hum was broken.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.296
I was doing the same things
I always did, all the same titan work,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.776
15-hour days, working
straight through the weekends,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.136
no regrets, never surrender,
a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.360
full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.520
But there was no hum.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.600
Inside me was silence.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.776
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.016
sometimes four.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.856
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time ...

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.976
I was the perfect titan.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.320
I was a titan you could
take home to your mother.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.080
All the colors were the same,
and I was no longer having any fun.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.880
And it was my life.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.136
It was all I did.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.880
I was the hum, and the hum was me.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.216
So what do you do when the thing you do,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.920
the work you love,
starts to taste like dust?

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.936
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.336
"Cry me a river,
stupid writer titan lady."

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.135
(Laughter)

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.216
But you know, you do,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.015
if you make, if you work,
if you love what you do,

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:52.096
being a teacher, being a banker,
being a mother, being a painter,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.336
being Bill Gates,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.696
if you simply love another person
and that gives you the hum,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.296
if you know the hum,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.336
if you know what the hum feels like,
if you have been to the hum,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.400
when the hum stops, who are you?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.840
What are you?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.176
What am I?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.080
Am I still a titan?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.840
If the song of my heart ceases to play,
can I survive in the silence?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.080
And then my Southern waitress toddler
asks me a question.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.816
I'm on my way out the door,
I'm late, and she says,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.120
"Momma, wanna play?"

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.216
And I'm just about to say no,
when I realize two things.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.840
One, I'm supposed
to say yes to everything,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.680
and two, my Southern waitress
didn't call me "honey."

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.840
She's not calling everyone
"honey" anymore.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.336
When did that happen?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.816
I'm missing it, being a titan
and mourning my hum,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.760
and here she is changing
right before my eyes.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.520
And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.240
And I say, "Yes."

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.576
There's nothing special about it.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.296
We play, and we're joined by her sisters,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.776
and there's a lot of laughing,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.416
and I give a dramatic reading
from the book Everybody Poops.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.816
Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.936
(Laughter)

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.136
And yet, it is extraordinary,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.656
because in my pain and my panic,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.736
in the homelessness of my humlessness,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.320
I have nothing to do but pay attention.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.176
I focus.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.400
I am still.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.536
The nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.520
the troops, the canvas,
the high note does not exist.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.336
All that exists are sticky fingers

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.696
and gooey kisses
and tiny voices and crayons

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.296
and that song about letting go

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.336
of whatever it is that Frozen girl
needs to let go of.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.296
(Laughter)

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.480
It's all peace and simplicity.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.096
The air is so rare in this place for me
that I can barely breathe.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.280
I can barely believe I'm breathing.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.600
Play is the opposite of work.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.920
And I am happy.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.056
Something in me loosens.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.400
A door in my brain swings open,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.816
and a rush of energy comes.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.096
And it's not instantaneous,
but it happens, it does happen.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.320
I feel it.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.920
A hum creeps back.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.176
Not at full volume, barely there,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.496
it's quiet, and I have to stay
very still to hear it, but it is there.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.240
Not the hum, but a hum.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.040
And now I feel like I know
a very magical secret.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.296
Well, let's not get carried away.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.400
It's just love. That's all it is.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.360
No magic. No secret. It's just love.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.640
It's just something we forgot.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.056
The hum, the work hum,
the hum of the titan,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.440
that's just a replacement.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.376
If I have to ask you who I am,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.336
if I have to tell you who I am,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.816
if I describe myself in terms of shows

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.096
and hours of television
and how globally badass my brain is,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.040
I have forgotten what the real hum is.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.400
The hum is not power
and the hum is not work-specific.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.440
The hum is joy-specific.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.296
The real hum is love-specific.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.976
The hum is the electricity
that comes from being excited by life.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.736
The real hum is confidence and peace.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.256
The real hum ignores the stare of history,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.296
and the balls in the air,
and the expectation, and the pressure.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.880
The real hum is singular and original.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.536
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.936
but maybe God was whispering
the wrong words,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.818
because which one of the gods
was telling me I was the titan?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.000
It's just love.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.896
We could all use a little more love,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.280
a lot more love.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.440
Any time my child asks me to play,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.240
I will say yes.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.136
I make it a firm rule for one reason,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.416
to give myself permission,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.720
to free me from all
of my workaholic guilt.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.536
It's a law, so I don't have a choice,

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.696
and I don't have a choice,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.280
not if I want to feel the hum.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.736
I wish it were that easy,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.336
but I'm not good at playing.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.920
I don't like it.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.800
I'm not interested in doing it
the way I'm interested in doing work.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.656
The truth is incredibly humbling
and humiliating to face.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.416
I don't like playing.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.216
I work all the time
because I like working.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.120
I like working more
than I like being at home.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.760
Facing that fact
is incredibly difficult to handle,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.720
because what kind of person
likes working more than being at home?

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.360
Well, me.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.176
I mean, let's be honest,
I call myself a titan.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.576
I've got issues.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.216
(Laughter)

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.256
And one of those issues
isn't that I am too relaxed.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.376
(Laughter)

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.080
We run around the yard,
up and back and up and back.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.176
We have 30-second dance parties.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.760
We sing show tunes. We play with balls.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.336
I blow bubbles and they pop them.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.320
And I feel stiff and delirious
and confused most of the time.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.480
I itch for my cell phone always.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.896
But it is OK.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.776
My tiny humans show me how to live
and the hum of the universe fills me up.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.776
I play and I play until I begin to wonder

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.800
why we ever stop playing
in the first place.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.760
You can do it too,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.400
say yes every time
your child asks you to play.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.496
Are you thinking that maybe
I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.336
You're right, but you can still do this.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.016
You have time.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.776
You know why? Because you're not Rihanna
and you're not a Muppet.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.176
Your child does not think
you're that interesting.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.336
(Laughter)

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.336
You only need 15 minutes.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.136
My two- and four-year-old
only ever want to play with me

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.576
for about 15 minutes or so

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.616
before they think to themselves
they want to do something else.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.216
It's an amazing 15 minutes,
but it's 15 minutes.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.216
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy,
I'm invisible after 15 minutes.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.256
(Laughter)

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.016
And my 13-year-old, if I can get
a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.376
I'm Parent of the Year.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.056
(Laughter)

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.816
15 minutes is all you need.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.480
I can totally pull off 15 minutes
of uninterrupted time on my worst day.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.216
Uninterrupted is the key.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.136
No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.896
You have a busy life.
You have to get dinner on the table.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.056
You have to force them to bathe.
But you can do 15 minutes.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.496
My kids are my happy place,
they're my world,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.016
but it doesn't have to be your kids,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.456
the fuel that feeds your hum,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.136
the place where life
feels more good than not good.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.656
It's not about playing with your kids,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.936
it's about joy.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.320
It's about playing in general.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.096
Give yourself the 15 minutes.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.296
Find what makes you feel good.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.600
Just figure it out and play in that arena.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.096
I'm not perfect at it.
In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.960
seeing friends, reading books,
staring into space.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.696
"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand
for indulging myself

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.936
in ways I'd given up on right around
the time I got my first TV show,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.696
right around the time
I became a titan-in-training,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.120
right around the time I started
competing with myself for ways unknown.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.736
15 minutes? What could be wrong
with giving myself my full attention

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.080
for 15 minutes?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.360
Turns out, nothing.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.016
The very act of not working has made it
possible for the hum to return,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.480
as if the hum's engine
could only refuel while I was away.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.120
Work doesn't work without play.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.040
It takes a little time,
but after a few months,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.216
one day the floodgates open

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.616
and there's a rush, and I find myself
standing in my office

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.736
filled with an unfamiliar melody,
full on groove inside me,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.536
and around me, and it sends me
spinning with ideas,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.616
and the humming road is open,
and I can drive it and drive it,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.400
and I love working again.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.736
But now, I like that hum,
but I don't love that hum.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.016
I don't need that hum.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.216
I am not that hum. That hum is not me,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.440
not anymore.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.736
I am bubbles and sticky fingers
and dinners with friends.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.960
I am that hum.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.736
Life's hum.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.056
Love's hum.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.319
Work's hum is still a piece of me,
it is just no longer all of me,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.400
and I am so grateful.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.296
And I don't give a crap
about being a titan,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.480
because I have never once seen a titan
play Red Rover, Red Rover.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.175
I said yes to less work and more play,
and somehow I still run my world.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.160
My brain is still global.
My campfires still burn.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.359
The more I play, the happier I am,
and the happier my kids are.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.176
The more I play,
the more I feel like a good mother.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.656
The more I play,
the freer my mind becomes.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.576
The more I play, the better I work.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.096
The more I play, the more I feel the hum,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.496
the nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.140
the troops, the canvas,
the high note, the hum, the hum,

00:17:53.164 --> 00:17:55.564
the other hum, the real hum,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.456
life's hum.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.736
The more I feel that hum,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.296
the more this strange,
quivering, uncocooned,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.656
awkward, brand new,

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.200
alive non-titan feels like me.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.000
The more I feel that hum,
the more I know who I am.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.680
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.256
That part of the job,
that's living the dream.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.360
That's the dream of the job.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.880
Because a dream job
should be a little bit dreamy.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.760
I said yes to less work and more play.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.360
Titans need not apply.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.360
Wanna play?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.176
Thank you.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:42.880
(Applause)
