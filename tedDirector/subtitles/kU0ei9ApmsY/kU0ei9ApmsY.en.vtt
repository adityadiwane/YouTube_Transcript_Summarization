00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
What I want to talk to you about

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is what we can learn from studying the genomes

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
of living people

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and extinct humans.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
But before doing that,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that our genomes, our genetic material,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
in the form of DNA,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
which is this famous double-helical molecule.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And the genetic information

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
is contained in the form of a sequence

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
of four bases

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And the information is there twice --

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
one on each strand --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
which is important,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
because when new cells are formed, these strands come apart,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in an almost perfect process.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But nothing, of course, in nature

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
is totally perfect,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
so sometimes an error is made

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and a wrong letter is built in.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And we can then see the result

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
of such mutations

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
when we compare DNA sequences

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
among us here in the room, for example.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
If we compare my genome to the genome of you,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
approximately every 1,200, 1,300 letters

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
will differ between us.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And these mutations accumulate

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
approximately as a function of time.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
So if we add in a chimpanzee here, we will see more differences.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Approximately one letter in a hundred

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
will differ from a chimpanzee.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And if you're then interested in the history

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
of a piece of DNA, or the whole genome,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
you can reconstruct the history of the DNA

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
with those differences you observe.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And generally we depict our ideas about this history

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in the form of trees like this.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
In this case, it's very simple.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
The two human DNA sequences

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
go back to a common ancestor quite recently.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And because these mutations

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
happen approximately as a function of time,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
you can transform these differences

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
to estimates of time,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
where the two humans, typically,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and with the chimpanzees,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
it will be in the order of five million years ago.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
So what has now happened in the last few years

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is that there are account technologies around

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
that allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So we can now, in a matter of hours,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
determine a whole human genome.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Each of us, of course, contains two human genomes --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
one from our mothers and one from our fathers.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And they are around three billion such letters long.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And we will find that the two genomes in me,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
or one genome of mine we want to use,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
will have about three million differences

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
in the order of that.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And what you can then also begin to do

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
is to say, "How are these genetic differences

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
distributed across the world?"

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And if you do that,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And if you look outside Africa,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
you actually find less genetic variation.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
This is surprising, of course,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
because in the order of six to eight times fewer people

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
live in Africa than outside Africa.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Yet the people inside Africa

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
have more genetic variation.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Moreover, almost all these genetic variants

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
we see outside Africa

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
have closely related DNA sequences

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
that you find inside Africa.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But if you look in Africa,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
there is a component of the genetic variation

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that has no close relatives outside.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So a model to explain this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
is that a part of the African variation, but not all of it,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
[has] gone out and colonized the rest of the world.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And together with the methods to date these genetic differences,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
this has led to the insight

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
that modern humans --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
evolved in Africa, quite recently,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
between 100 and 200,000 years ago.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
went out of Africa

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
to colonize the rest of the world.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
So what I often like to say

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
is that, from a genomic perspective,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
we are all Africans.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
We either live inside Africa today,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
or in quite recent exile.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Another consequence

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
of this recent origin of modern humans

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
is that genetic variants

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
are generally distributed widely in the world,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in many places,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and they tend to vary as gradients,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.260
from a bird's-eye perspective at least.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And since there are many genetic variants,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and they have different such gradients,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
this means that if we determine a DNA sequence --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
a genome from one individual --

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
we can quite accurately estimate

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
where that person comes from,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
provided that its parents or grandparents

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
haven't moved around too much.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
But does this then mean,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
as many people tend to think,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
on different continents, for example?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Well we can begin to ask those questions also.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
There is, for example, a project that's underway

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
to sequence a thousand individuals --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
their genomes -- from different parts of the world.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
They've sequenced 185 Africans

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
from two populations in Africa.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in Europe and in China.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And we can begin to say how much variance do we find,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
how many letters that vary

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
in at least one of those individual sequences.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
But we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
between Africans and non-Africans?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Perhaps the biggest difference

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
most of us would imagine existed.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And with absolute difference --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and I mean a difference

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
where people inside Africa at a certain position,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and everybody outside Africa has another letter.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And the answer to that, among those millions of differences,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
is that there is not a single such position.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
This may be surprising.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
So we can relax the criterion a bit

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and say: How many positions do we find

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
where 95 percent of people in Africa have

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
one variant,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
95 percent another variant,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and the number of that is 12.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
So this is very surprising.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
It means that when we look at people

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and see a person from Africa

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and a person from Europe or Asia,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.260
we cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
predict what the person would carry.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And only for 12 positions

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
can we hope to be 95 percent right.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
This may be surprising,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
because we can, of course, look at these people

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
So what this means now

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
is that those traits we then look at

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and so readily see --

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
facial features, skin color, hair structure --

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
are not determined by single genes with big effects,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
but are determined by many different genetic variants

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that seem to vary in frequency

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
between different parts of the world.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
There is another thing with those traits

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
that we so easily observe in each other

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that I think is worthwhile to consider,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and that is that, in a very literal sense,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
they're really on the surface of our bodies.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
They are what we just said --

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
facial features, hair structure, skin color.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
There are also a number of features

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
that vary between continents like that

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.260
that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
or that have to do

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
with how our immune systems deal with microbes

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
that try to invade our bodies.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
But so those are all parts of our bodies

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
where we very directly interact with our environment,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.260
in a direct confrontation, if you like.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It's easy to imagine

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
how particularly those parts of our bodies

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
were quickly influenced by selection from the environment

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and shifted frequencies of genes

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
that are involved in them.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
But if we look on other parts of our bodies

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
where we don't directly interact with the environment --

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
our kidneys, our livers, our hearts --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
there is no way to say,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
by just looking at these organs,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
where in the world they would come from.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So there's another interesting thing

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that comes from this realization

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
that humans have a recent common origin in Africa,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and that is that when those humans emerged

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
around 100,000 years ago or so,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
they were not alone on the planet.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
There were other forms of humans around,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
most famously perhaps, Neanderthals --

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
these robust forms of humans,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
compared to the left here

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.260
with a modern human skeleton on the right --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that existed in Western Asia and Europe

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
since several hundreds of thousands of years.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So an interesting question is,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
what happened when we met?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
What happened to the Neanderthals?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And to begin to answer such questions,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.260
my research group -- since over 25 years now --

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
works on methods to extract DNA

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
from remains of Neanderthals

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and extinct animals

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that are tens of thousands of years old.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So this involves a lot of technical issues

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
in how you extract the DNA,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
how you convert it to a form you can sequence.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
You have to work very carefully

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to avoid contamination of experiments

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
with DNA from yourself.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And this then, in conjunction with these methods

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
allowed us last year

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
so that any one of you

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
or at least on the 55 percent of it

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
that we've been able to reconstruct so far.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
of people who live today.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And one question

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that you may then want to ask

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
is, what happened when we met?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Did we mix or not?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
And the way to ask that question

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and compare it to genomes

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
of people who live today.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
So we then look

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
to do this with pairs of individuals,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
starting with two Africans,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
looking at the two African genomes,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
finding places where they differ from each other,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Does it match one African or the other African?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
We would expect there to be no difference,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
because Neanderthals were never in Africa.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
They should be equal, have no reason to be closer

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
to one African than another African.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And that's indeed the case.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Statistically speaking, there is no difference

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260
in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
But this is different

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
if we now look at the European individual and an African.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Then, significantly more often,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
does a Neanderthal match the European

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
rather than the African.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
versus an African,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.260
the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
This may also be surprising

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
because the Neanderthals were never in China.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
So the model we've proposed to explain this

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
is that when modern humans came out of Africa

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
sometime after 100,000 years ago,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
they met Neanderthals.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Presumably, they did so first in the Middle East,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
where there were Neanderthals living.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
If they then mixed with each other there,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
then those modern humans

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that became the ancestors

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
of everyone outside Africa

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
to the rest of the world.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So that today, the people living outside Africa

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
have about two and a half percent of their DNA

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
from Neanderthals.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So having now a Neanderthal genome

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
on hand as a reference point

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and having the technologies

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
to look at ancient remains

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and extract the DNA,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.260
we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
in the Altai Mountains

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
at a place called Denisova,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
a cave site in this mountain here,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
where archeologists in 2008

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
found a tiny little piece of bone --

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
this is a copy of it --

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.260
that they realized came from the last phalanx

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
of a little finger of a pinky of a human.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And it was well enough preserved

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
so we could determine the DNA from this individual,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
even to a greater extent

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
than for the Neanderthals actually,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
and to people today.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And we found that this individual

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
shared a common origin for his DNA sequences

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.260
with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And further back, 800,000 years ago

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
is there a common origin

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
with present day humans.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
So this individual comes from a population

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
that shares an origin with Neanderthals,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
but far back and then have a long independent history.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
We call this group of humans,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
that we then described for the first time

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
from this tiny, tiny little piece of bone,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
the Denisovans,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
after this place where they were first described.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
So we can then ask for Denisovans

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
the same things as for the Neanderthals:

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Did they mix with ancestors of present day people?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
If we ask that question,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
and compare the Denisovan genome

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to people around the world,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
we surprisingly find

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
no evidence of Denisovan DNA

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.260
in any people living even close to Siberia today.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
But we do find it in Papua New Guinea

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
So this presumably means

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
were ever in Siberia.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
So from studying

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
these genomes of extinct humans,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
when modern humans started coming out of Africa.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
In the West, there were Neanderthals;

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
in the East, there were Denisovans --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
maybe other forms of humans too

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
that we've not yet described.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
but we know that in Southern Siberia,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
at least at some time in the past.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
They meet Neanderthals, mix with them,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
continue to spread over the world,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and somewhere in Southeast Asia,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
they meet Denisovans and mix with them

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and continue on out into the Pacific.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And then these earlier forms of humans disappear,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
but they live on a little bit today

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
in some of us --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
from Neanderthals,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
and people in Melanesia

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
actually have an additional five percent approximately

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
from the Denisovans.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
Does this then mean that there is after all

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
some absolute difference

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
between people outside Africa and inside Africa

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
in that people outside Africa

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
have this old component in their genome

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
from these extinct forms of humans,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
whereas Africans do not?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Well I don't think that is the case.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Presumably, modern humans

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
emerged somewhere in Africa.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
They spread across Africa also, of course,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
and there were older, earlier forms of humans there.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
And since we mixed elsewhere,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
I'm pretty sure that one day,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
when we will perhaps have a genome

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
of also these earlier forms in Africa,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
we will find that they have also mixed

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
with early modern humans in Africa.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
So to sum up,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
what have we learned from studying genomes

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
of present day humans

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and extinct humans?

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
We learn perhaps many things,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.260
but one thing that I find sort of important to mention

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
We mixed with these earlier forms of humans,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
wherever we met them,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and we mixed with each other ever since.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Thank you for your attention.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:55.260
