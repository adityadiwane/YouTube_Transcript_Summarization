00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:17.737
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.537
Obviously, that's changed,

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.381
but only recently.

00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:24.629
It was several months ago

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.602
that I gave my very first
major public talk

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.217
at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.431
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.865
That meant that in 1998,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.452
the oldest among the group were only 14,

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:44.299
and the youngest, just four.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.628
I joked with them that some
might only have heard of me

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:50.580
from rap songs.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.727
Yes, I'm in rap songs.

00:00:53.727 --> 00:00:57.424
Almost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)

00:00:58.614 --> 00:01:02.109
But the night of my speech,
a surprising thing happened.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.355
At the age of 41, I was hit on
by a 27-year-old guy.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.331
I know, right?

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.914
He was charming and I was flattered,

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:16.687
and I declined.

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:20.331
You know what his
unsuccessful pickup line was?

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.461
He could make me feel 22 again.

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:29.407
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:35.908
I realized later that night,
I'm probably the only person over 40

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.509
who does not want to be 22 again.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.109
(Laughter)

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.969
(Applause)

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:52.294
At the age of 22,
I fell in love with my boss,

00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:55.115
and at the age of 24,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.547
I learned the devastating consequences.

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.848
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:07.361
who didn't make a mistake
or do something they regretted at 22?

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.718
Yep. That's what I thought.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:18.428
So like me, at 22, a few of you
may have also taken wrong turns

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:21.466
and fallen in love with the wrong person,

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.428
maybe even your boss.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.973
Unlike me, though, your boss

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:31.052
probably wasn't the president
of the United States of America.

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:36.098
Of course, life is full of surprises.

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:41.021
Not a day goes by that I'm not
reminded of my mistake,

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.294
and I regret that mistake deeply.

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:52.026
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:57.488
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom

00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:01.535
like we had never seen before.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.877
Remember, just a few years earlier,

00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:06.879
news was consumed from just three places:

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.551
reading a newspaper or magazine,

00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.386
listening to the radio,

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:13.004
or watching television.

00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.304
That was it.

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:18.259
But that wasn't my fate.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.881
Instead, this scandal was brought to you

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.281
by the digital revolution.

00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:27.988
That meant we could access
all the information we wanted,

00:03:27.988 --> 00:03:32.283
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,

00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:36.973
and when the story broke in January 1998,

00:03:36.973 --> 00:03:39.759
it broke online.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.760
It was the first time the traditional news

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.283
was usurped by the Internet
for a major news story,

00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:51.504
a click that reverberated
around the world.

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:54.922
What that meant for me personally

00:03:54.922 --> 00:04:00.040
was that overnight I went
from being a completely private figure

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.487
to a publicly humiliated one worldwide.

00:04:05.487 --> 00:04:09.782
I was patient zero
of losing a personal reputation

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:14.338
on a global scale almost instantaneously.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.927
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,

00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:22.042
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.101
Granted, it was before social media,

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.653
but people could still comment online,

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:34.881
email stories, and, of course,
email cruel jokes.

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.970
News sources plastered
photos of me all over

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.754
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:44.293
and to keep people tuned to the TV.

00:04:45.913 --> 00:04:49.462
Do you recall a particular image of me,

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:51.924
say, wearing a beret?

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:56.219
Now, I admit I made mistakes,

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.087
especially wearing that beret.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:04.556
But the attention and judgment
that I received, not the story,

00:05:04.556 --> 00:05:08.920
but that I personally received,
was unprecedented.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.079
I was branded as a tramp,

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:18.627
tart, slut, whore, bimbo,

00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:21.405
and, of course, that woman.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:25.220
I was seen by many

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.608
but actually known by few.

00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:32.186
And I get it: it was easy to forget

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:34.787
that that woman was dimensional,

00:05:34.787 --> 00:05:38.755
had a soul, and was once unbroken.

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:46.404
When this happened to me 17 years ago,
there was no name for it.

00:05:46.404 --> 00:05:50.801
Now we call it cyberbullying
and online harassment.

00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:55.917
Today, I want to share
some of my experience with you,

00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.351
talk about how that experience has helped
shape my cultural observations,

00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:05.203
and how I hope my past experience
can lead to a change that results

00:06:05.203 --> 00:06:07.641
in less suffering for others.

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:15.494
In 1998, I lost my reputation
and my dignity.

00:06:15.494 --> 00:06:18.994
I lost almost everything,

00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:22.105
and I almost lost my life.

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.299
Let me paint a picture for you.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.866
It is September of 1998.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.552
I'm sitting in a windowless office room

00:06:35.552 --> 00:06:38.616
inside the Office
of the Independent Counsel

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:43.051
underneath humming fluorescent lights.

00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:46.882
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,

00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:50.620
my voice on surreptitiously
taped phone calls

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.756
that a supposed friend
had made the year before.

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:57.331
I'm here because
I've been legally required

00:06:57.331 --> 00:07:03.194
to personally authenticate
all 20 hours of taped conversation.

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:09.181
For the past eight months,
the mysterious content of these tapes

00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:13.129
has hung like the Sword
of Damocles over my head.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:17.215
I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?

00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:21.303
Scared and mortified, I listen,

00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:27.555
listen as I prattle on
about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:31.426
listen as I confess my love
for the president,

00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:34.805
and, of course, my heartbreak;

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:39.623
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:44.342
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;

00:07:45.262 --> 00:07:48.121
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,

00:07:48.121 --> 00:07:50.805
to the worst version of myself,

00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:54.317
a self I don't even recognize.

00:07:56.537 --> 00:08:00.659
A few days later, the Starr Report
is released to Congress,

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:05.770
and all of those tapes and transcripts,
those stolen words, form a part of it.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.961
That people can read the transcripts
is horrific enough,

00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.708
but a few weeks later,

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:17.005
the audio tapes are aired on TV,

00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:20.591
and significant portions
made available online.

00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:27.245
The public humiliation was excruciating.

00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:30.708
Life was almost unbearable.

00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:38.054
This was not something that happened
with regularity back then in 1998,

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:43.836
and by this, I mean the stealing
of people's private words, actions,

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.459
conversations or photos,

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:49.038
and then making them public --

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:51.475
public without consent,

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:53.937
public without context,

00:08:53.937 --> 00:08:56.531
and public without compassion.

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:01.181
Fast forward 12 years to 2010,

00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:04.338
and now social media has been born.

00:09:05.158 --> 00:09:10.190
The landscape has sadly become much
more populated with instances like mine,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.208
whether or not someone
actually make a mistake,

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:18.920
and now it's for both public
and private people.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.849
The consequences for some
have become dire, very dire.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.347
I was on the phone with my mom

00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:31.064
in September of 2010,

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:32.921
and we were talking about the news

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:35.713
of a young college freshman
from Rutgers University

00:09:35.713 --> 00:09:37.866
named Tyler Clementi.

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:41.804
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler

00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:44.183
was secretly webcammed by his roommate

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.956
while being intimate with another man.

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:51.264
When the online world
learned of this incident,

00:09:51.264 --> 00:09:54.399
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:57.998
A few days later,

00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:01.714
Tyler jumped from 
the George Washington Bridge

00:10:01.714 --> 00:10:03.247
to his death.

00:10:03.247 --> 00:10:05.194
He was 18.

00:10:07.644 --> 00:10:12.347
My mom was beside herself about
what happened to Tyler and his family,

00:10:12.347 --> 00:10:14.902
and she was gutted with pain

00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:18.570
in a way that I just couldn't
quite understand,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.940
and then eventually I realized

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.921
she was reliving 1998,

00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:27.954
reliving a time when she sat
by my bed every night,

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:36.797
reliving a time when she made me shower
with the bathroom door open,

00:10:36.797 --> 00:10:40.907
and reliving a time
when both of my parents feared

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:43.857
that I would be humiliated to death,

00:10:43.857 --> 00:10:46.169
literally.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:51.286
Today, too many parents

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:54.628
haven't had the chance to step in
and rescue their loved ones.

00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:58.809
Too many have learned
of their child's suffering and humiliation

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:01.374
after it was too late.

00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:06.541
Tyler's tragic, senseless death
was a turning point for me.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:10.582
It served to recontextualize
my experiences,

00:11:10.582 --> 00:11:14.877
and I then began to look at the world
of humiliation and bullying around me

00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:18.360
and see something different.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.584
In 1998, we had no way of knowing
where this brave new technology

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:26.254
called the Internet would take us.

00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:30.462
Since then, it has connected people
in unimaginable ways,

00:11:30.462 --> 00:11:32.379
joining lost siblings,

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:36.450
saving lives, launching revolutions,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.300
but the darkness, cyberbullying,
and slut-shaming that I experienced

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.805
had mushroomed.

00:11:45.145 --> 00:11:49.845
Every day online, people,
especially young people

00:11:49.845 --> 00:11:52.772
who are not developmentally
equipped to handle this,

00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:55.304
are so abused and humiliated

00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:57.996
that they can't imagine living
to the next day,

00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:01.145
and some, tragically, don't,

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:03.901
and there's nothing virtual about that.

00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:11.628
ChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused
on helping young people on various issues,

00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:15.309
released a staggering statistic
late last year:

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:18.930
From 2012 to 2013,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.204
there was an 87 percent increase

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:27.080
in calls and emails related
to cyberbullying.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.262
A meta-analysis done
out of the Netherlands

00:12:29.262 --> 00:12:31.257
showed that for the first time,

00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:36.299
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:40.199
more significantly than offline bullying.

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:43.960
And you know what shocked me,
although it shouldn't have,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.897
was other research last year
that determined humiliation

00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:50.895
was a more intensely felt emotion

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:54.955
than either happiness or even anger.

00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:59.490
Cruelty to others is nothing new,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:05.870
but online, technologically
enhanced shaming is amplified,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:11.187
uncontained, and permanently accessible.

00:13:11.187 --> 00:13:16.877
The echo of embarrassment used to extend
only as far as your family, village,

00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:19.221
school or community,

00:13:19.221 --> 00:13:23.099
but now it's the online community too.

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:25.941
Millions of people, often anonymously,

00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:29.934
can stab you with their words,
and that's a lot of pain,

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.070
and there are no perimeters
around how many people

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.158
can publicly observe you

00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:38.577
and put you in a public stockade.

00:13:39.717 --> 00:13:42.186
There is a very personal price

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:44.300
to public humiliation,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.901
and the growth of the Internet
has jacked up that price.

00:13:51.841 --> 00:13:54.268
For nearly two decades now,

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:58.386
we have slowly been sowing the seeds
of shame and public humiliation

00:13:58.386 --> 00:14:04.207
in our cultural soil,
both on- and offline.

00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:09.105
Gossip websites, paparazzi,
reality programming, politics,

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:14.941
news outlets and sometimes hackers
all traffic in shame.

00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:19.159
It's led to desensitization
and a permissive environment online

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:25.521
which lends itself to trolling,
invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.

00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:29.306
This shift has created
what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:33.090
a culture of humiliation.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:38.269
Consider a few prominent examples
just from the past six months alone.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:43.353
Snapchat, the service which is used
mainly by younger generations

00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:46.048
and claims that its messages
only have the lifespan

00:14:46.048 --> 00:14:47.751
of a few seconds.

00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:51.161
You can imagine the range
of content that that gets.

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:55.294
A third-party app which Snapchatters
use to preserve the lifespan

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.988
of the messages was hacked,

00:14:57.988 --> 00:15:04.838
and 100,000 personal conversations,
photos, and videos were leaked online

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:09.095
to now have a lifespan of forever.

00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:13.251
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
had their iCloud accounts hacked,

00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:17.198
and private, intimate, nude photos
were plastered across the Internet

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:19.080
without their permission.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.212
One gossip website
had over five million hits

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:25.787
for this one story.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:30.526
And what about the Sony Pictures
cyberhacking?

00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:33.523
The documents which received
the most attention

00:15:33.523 --> 00:15:39.559
were private emails that had
maximum public embarrassment value.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:42.809
But in this culture of humiliation,

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:46.899
there is another kind of price tag
attached to public shaming.

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:50.797
The price does not measure
the cost to the victim,

00:15:50.797 --> 00:15:53.050
which Tyler and too many others,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.024
notably women, minorities,

00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:59.202
and members of the LGBTQ
community have paid,

00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:03.758
but the price measures the profit
of those who prey on them.

00:16:04.868 --> 00:16:08.931
This invasion of others is a raw material,

00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:14.921
efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
packaged and sold at a profit.

00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:20.703
A marketplace has emerged
where public humiliation is a commodity

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:24.047
and shame is an industry.

00:16:24.047 --> 00:16:27.739
How is the money made?

00:16:27.739 --> 00:16:29.573
Clicks.

00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:32.104
The more shame, the more clicks.

00:16:32.104 --> 00:16:35.958
The more clicks,
the more advertising dollars.

00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:39.633
We're in a dangerous cycle.

00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:42.558
The more we click on this kind of gossip,

00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:46.279
the more numb we get
to the human lives behind it,

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:51.735
and the more numb we get,
the more we click.

00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:54.658
All the while, someone is making money

00:16:54.658 --> 00:16:57.541
off of the back 
of someone else's suffering.

00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:01.674
With every click, we make a choice.

00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:05.086
The more we saturate our culture
with public shaming,

00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:06.945
the more accepted it is,

00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:10.148
the more we will see behavior
like cyberbullying,

00:17:10.148 --> 00:17:12.795
trolling, some forms of hacking,

00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:15.721
and online harassment.

00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:23.429
Why? Because they all have
humiliation at their cores.

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:27.725
This behavior is a symptom
of the culture we've created.

00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:30.032
Just think about it.

00:17:31.232 --> 00:17:34.644
Changing behavior begins
with evolving beliefs.

00:17:34.644 --> 00:17:38.150
We've seen that to be true
with racism, homophobia,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.100
and plenty of other biases,
today and in the past.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.068
As we've changed beliefs
about same-sex marriage,

00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:50.550
more people have been
offered equal freedoms.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.733
When we began valuing sustainability,

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:55.681
more people began to recycle.

00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.956
So as far as our culture
of humiliation goes,

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:02.601
what we need is a cultural revolution.

00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:06.524
Public shaming
as a blood sport has to stop,

00:18:06.524 --> 00:18:11.401
and it's time for an intervention
on the Internet and in our culture.

00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:15.077
The shift begins with something simple,
but it's not easy.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:22.772
We need to return to a long-held value
of compassion -- compassion and empathy.

00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:25.959
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:28.021
an empathy crisis.

00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:32.995
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,

00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:36.571
"Shame can't survive empathy."

00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:41.015
Shame cannot survive empathy.

00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:46.136
I've seen some very dark days in my life,

00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:52.197
and it was the compassion and empathy
from my family, friends, professionals,

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:56.273
and sometimes even strangers
that saved me.

00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:01.128
Even empathy from one person
can make a difference.

00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:04.991
The theory of minority influence,

00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:08.195
proposed by social psychologist
Serge Moscovici,

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:10.981
says that even in small numbers,

00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:13.233
when there's consistency over time,

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:15.834
change can happen.

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:19.061
In the online world,
we can foster minority influence

00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:21.488
by becoming upstanders.

00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:25.214
To become an upstander means
instead of bystander apathy,

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:30.452
we can post a positive comment for someone
or report a bullying situation.

00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:34.605
Trust me, compassionate comments
help abate the negativity.

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:39.193
We can also counteract the culture
by supporting organizations

00:19:39.193 --> 00:19:41.469
that deal with these kinds of issues,

00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:44.277
like the Tyler Clementi
Foundation in the U.S.,

00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:47.088
In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:50.680
and in Australia, there's Project Rockit.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:58.157
We talk a lot about our right
to freedom of expression,

00:19:58.157 --> 00:20:00.182
but we need to talk more about

00:20:00.182 --> 00:20:03.736
our responsibility
to freedom of expression.

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:06.475
We all want to be heard,

00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:11.258
but let's acknowledge the difference
between speaking up with intention

00:20:11.258 --> 00:20:14.374
and speaking up for attention.

00:20:15.684 --> 00:20:19.222
The Internet is 
the superhighway for the id,

00:20:19.222 --> 00:20:22.380
but online, showing empathy to others

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.930
benefits us all and helps create
a safer and better world.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.134
We need to communicate
online with compassion,

00:20:31.134 --> 00:20:33.595
consume news with compassion,

00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:36.289
and click with compassion.

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:40.923
Just imagine walking a mile
in someone else's headline.

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:46.461
I'd like to end on a personal note.

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:49.651
In the past nine months,

00:20:49.651 --> 00:20:53.175
the question I've been 
asked the most is why.

00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:57.193
Why now? Why was I 
sticking my head above the parapet?

00:20:57.193 --> 00:20:59.710
You can read between the lines
in those questions,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.559
and the answer has nothing
to do with politics.

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:09.166
The top note answer was and is
because it's time:

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.873
time to stop tip-toeing around my past;

00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:15.115
time to stop living a life of opprobrium;

00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:18.349
and time to take back my narrative.

00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:23.194
It's also not just about saving myself.

00:21:23.194 --> 00:21:26.607
Anyone who is suffering from shame
and public humiliation

00:21:26.607 --> 00:21:29.394
needs to know one thing:

00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:32.111
You can survive it.

00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:34.874
I know it's hard.

00:21:34.874 --> 00:21:38.505
It may not be painless, quick or easy,

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:43.181
but you can insist
on a different ending to your story.

00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:46.548
Have compassion for yourself.

00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:49.636
We all deserve compassion,

00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:55.835
and to live both online and off
in a more compassionate world.

00:21:55.835 --> 00:21:58.435
Thank you for listening.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:08.815
(Applause)
