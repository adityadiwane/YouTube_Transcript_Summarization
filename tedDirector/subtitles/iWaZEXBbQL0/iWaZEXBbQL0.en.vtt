00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.160
I'd like you to imagine the world anew.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.016
I'd like to show you some maps,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.776
which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.496
of the planet in a way

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.600
that most of you will never
have seen the planet depicted before.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.560
Here's an image
that you're very familiar with.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.536
I'm old enough that I was actually born
before we saw this image.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.136
Apparently some of my first words
were "moona, moona,"

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.256
but I think that's my mom
having a particular fantasy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.536
about what her baby boy could see

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.840
on the flickering
black and white TV screen.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.296
It's only been a few centuries

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.560
since we've actually, most of us,
thought of our planet as spherical.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.216
When we first saw
these images in the 1960s,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.520
the world was changing
at an incredible rate.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.640
In my own little discipline
of human geography,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.336
a cartographer called Waldo Tobler

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.896
was drawing new maps of the planet,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.416
and these maps have now spread,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.447
and I'm going to show you one of them now.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.680
This map is a map of the world,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.136
but it's a map which looks to you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.600
a little bit strange.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.016
It's a map in which we stretched places,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.736
so that those areas which contain
many people are drawn larger,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.696
and those areas,
like the Sahara and the Himalayas,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200
in which there are few people,
have been shrunk away.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.400
Everybody on the planet
is given an equal amount of space.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.960
The cities are shown shining bright.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.256
The lines are showing you
submarine cables and trade routes.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.936
And there's one particular line
that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.656
through past Singapore,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.416
through the Suez Canal,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.776
through the Mediterranean
and round to Rotterdam.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.296
And it's showing you the route

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.256
of what was the world's
largest ship just a year ago,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.296
a ship which was taking
so many containers of goods

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.176
that when they were unloaded,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.440
if the lorries had all gone in convoy,
they would have been 100 kilometers long.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.416
This is how our world is now connected.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.416
This is the quantity of stuff
we are now moving around the world,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.176
just on one ship, on one voyage,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.400
in five weeks.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.840
We've lived in cities
for a very long time,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.856
but most of us didn't live in cities.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.016
This is Çatalhöyük,
one of the world's first cities.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.280
At its peak 9,000 years ago,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.360
people had to walk over the roofs
of others' houses to get to their home.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.376
If you look carefully
at the map of the city,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.320
you'll see it has no streets,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.960
because streets are something we invented.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.976
The world changes.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.880
It changes by trial and error.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.296
We work out slowly and gradually

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.120
how to live in better ways.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.480
And the world has changed
incredibly quickly most recently.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.536
It's only within the last six,
seven, or eight generations

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.640
that we have actually realized
that we are a species.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.400
It's only within the last few decades

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.000
that a map like this could be drawn.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.440
Again, the underlying map
is the map of world population,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.216
but over it, you're seeing arrows
showing how we spread out of Africa

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.016
with dates showing you
where we think we arrived

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.800
at particular times.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.536
I have to redraw this map
every few months,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.536
because somebody makes a discovery
that a particular date was wrong.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.080
We are learning about ourselves
at an incredible speed.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.800
And we're changing.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.896
A lot of change is gradual.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.416
It's accretion.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.296
We don't notice the change

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.136
because we only have short lives,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.760
70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.576
This graph is showing you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.320
the annual rate of population
growth in the world.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.056
It was very low until around about 1850,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.696
and then the rate of population growth

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.960
began to rise

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.856
so that around the time I was born,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.600
when we first saw those images
from the moon of our planet,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.000
our global population
was growing at two percent a year.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.400
If it had carried on growing
at two percent a year

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.440
for just another couple of centuries,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.816
the entire planet would be covered

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.896
with a seething mass of human bodies

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.960
all touching each other.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.816
And people were scared.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.656
They were scared of population growth

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.016
and what they called
"the population bomb" in 1968.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.240
But then, if you look
at the end of the graph,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.840
the growth began to slow.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.096
The decade --

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.576
the '70s, the '80s,
the '90s, the noughties,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.840
and in this decade, even faster --

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.216
our population growth is slowing.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.496
Our planet is stabilizing.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.536
We are heading towards nine,
10, or 11 billion people

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800
by the end of the century.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.736
Within that change, you can see tumult.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.576
You can see the Second World War.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.776
You can see the pandemic
in 1918 from influenza.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.680
You can see the great Chinese famine.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.696
These are the events
we tend to concentrate on.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.656
We tend to concentrate
on the terrible events in the news.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.336
We don't tend to concentrate
on the gradual change

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.000
and the good news stories.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.176
We worry about people.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.456
We worry about how many people there are.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.640
We worry about how you can
get away from people.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.600
But this is the map of the world
changed again to make area large,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.136
the further away
people are from each area.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.096
So if you want to know
where to go to get away from everybody,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.696
here's the best places to go.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.536
And every year, these areas get bigger,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.816
because every year,
we are coming off the land globally.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.296
We are moving into the cities.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.496
We are packing in more densely.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.136
There are wolves again in Europe,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.080
and the wolves are moving west
across the continent.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.600
Our world is changing.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.240
You have worries.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.576
This is a map showing
where the water falls on our planet.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.296
We now know that.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.096
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.696
where three continents meet,
Africa, Asia, and Europe,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.696
and you can see there are
a large number of people living there

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.296
in areas with very little water.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.016
And you can see areas in which
there is a great deal of rainfall as well.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.200
And we can get a bit more sophisticated.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.816
Instead of making
the map be shaped by people,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.056
we can shape the map by water,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.936
and then we can change it every month

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.616
to show the amount of water

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.840
falling on every small part of the globe.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.216
And you see the monsoons
moving around the planet,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.840
and the planet almost appears
to have a heartbeat.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.240
And all of this only became possible

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.696
within my lifetime

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.880
to see this is where we are living.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.840
We have enough water.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.120
This is a map of where
we grow our food in the world.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.720
This is the areas that we will rely on
most for rice and maize and corn.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.616
People worry that there won't
be enough food, but we know,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.416
if we just ate less meat
and fed less of the crops to animals,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.856
there is enough food for everybody

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.200
as long as we think of ourselves
as one group of people.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.400
And we also know

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.336
about what we do

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.920
so terribly badly nowadays.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.320
You will have seen this map
of the world before.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.416
This is the map

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.816
produced by taking satellite images,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.616
if you remember those satellites
around the planet

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.400
in the very first slide I showed,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.240
and producing an image
of what the Earth looks like at night.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.616
When you normally see that map,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.160
on a normal map, the kind of map
that most of you will be used to,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.440
you think you are seeing
a map of where people live.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.600
Where the lights are shining up
is where people live.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.696
But here, on this image of the world,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.600
remember we've stretched the map again.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.680
Everywhere has the same density
of people on this map.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.656
If an area doesn't have people,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.576
we've shrunk it away

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.136
to make it disappear.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.296
So we're showing everybody

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.760
with equal prominence.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.616
Now, the lights no longer show you
where people are,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.080
because people are everywhere.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.056
Now the lights on the map,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.056
the lights in London,
the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.016
the lights on the Eastern Seaboard
of the United States,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.976
the lights show you where people live

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.200
who are so profligate with energy

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.680
that they can afford

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.216
to spend money

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.696
powering lights to shine up into the sky,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.800
so satellites can draw an image like this.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.960
And the areas that are dark on the map

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.440
are either areas where people
do not have access to that much energy,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.496
or areas where people do,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.360
but they have learned to stop
shining the light up into the sky.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.496
And if I could show you this map
animated over time,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.096
you would see that Tokyo
has actually become darker,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.920
because ever since the tsunami in Japan,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.296
Japan has had to rely
on a quarter less electricity

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.320
because it turned
the nuclear power stations off.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.640
And the world didn't end.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.576
You just shone less light

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.520
up into the sky.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.296
There are a huge number

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.760
of good news stories in the world.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.296
Infant mortality is falling

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.200
and has been falling
at an incredible rate.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.360
A few years ago,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.176
the number of babies dying
in their first year of life in the world

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.280
fell by five percent in just one year.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.096
More children are going to school

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.736
and learning to read and write

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.576
and getting connected to the Internet

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.616
and going on to go to university

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.536
than ever before at an incredible rate,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.016
and the highest number of young people
going to university in the world

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.920
are women, not men.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.056
I can give you good news story
after good news story

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.696
about what is getting
better in the planet,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.280
but we tend to concentrate

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.616
on the bad news that is immediate.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.840
Rebecca Solnit, I think,
put it brilliantly,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.600
when she explained: "The accretion
of incremental, imperceptible changes

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.336
which can constitute progress
and which render our era

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.176
dramatically different from the past" --

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.240
the past was much more stable --

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.616
"a contrast obscured by the undramatic
nature of gradual transformation,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.600
punctuated by occasional tumult."

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.680
Occasionally, terrible things happen.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.176
You are shown those terrible things

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.856
on the news every night of the week.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.856
You are not told about
the population slowing down.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.896
You are not told about the world
becoming more connected.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.576
You are not told about the incredible
improvements in understanding.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.736
You are not told about
how we are learning to begin

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.216
to waste less and consume less.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.440
This is my last map.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.736
On this map, we have taken the seas

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.560
and the oceans out.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.496
Now you are just looking

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.376
at about 7.4 billion people

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.320
with the map drawn
in proportion to those people.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.296
You're looking at over a billion in China,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.136
and you can see the largest
city in the world in China,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.640
but you do not know its name.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.936
You can see that India

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.040
is in the center of this world.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.936
You can see that Europe is on the edge.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.016
And we in Exeter today

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.976
are on the far edge of the planet.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.976
We are on a tiny scrap of rock

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.696
off Europe

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.336
which contains less than one percent

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.376
of the world's adults,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.936
and less than half a percent

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.800
of the world's children.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.256
We are living in a stabilizing world,
an urbanizing world,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.256
an aging world,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.416
a connecting world.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.880
There are many, many things
to be frightened about,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.936
but there is no need for us
to fear each other as much as we do,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.200
and we need to see
that we are now living in a new world.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.176
Thank you very much.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.840
(Applause)
