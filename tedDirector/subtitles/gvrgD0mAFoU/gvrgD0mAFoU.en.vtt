00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I went to Spain a few months ago

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and I had the best foie gras of my life.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
The best culinary experience of my life.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Ridiculous, right?

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Foie gras and the future of cooking.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
I mean, it's crucified.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
you risk being attacked.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.160
I'm not saying that there's not a rationale

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
for being opposed to foie gras.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
Basically you take a goose or a duck

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Its liver expands by eight times.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.160
The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
(Laughter)

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
I mean, I love the stuff.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160
Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Yes, sure.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
(Laughter)

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Not a lot of people are doing it.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
And for good reason.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
(Laughter)

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Eduardo Sousa.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Natural foie gras.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
What's natural about foie gras?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
geese and ducks gorge on food

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.160
to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and eat what they want.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160
So no gavage, no force feeding,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And it's shockingly not a new idea.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.160
His great-granddad started -- PaterÃ­a de Sousa -- in 1812.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.160
And they've been doing it quietly ever since.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
That is until last year,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160
when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
the coveted French gastronomic prize.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
It's like the Olympics of food products.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
He placed first for his foie gras.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Big, big problem.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
(Laughter)

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
He said it sort of gleefully.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
It was all over the papers.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
I read about it. It was in Le Monde.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
They accused him of paying off the judges.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
Huh, amazing.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.160
A huge scandal for a few weeks.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
Couldn't find a shred of evidence.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Now, look at the guy.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
for his foie gras.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
So that died down, and very soon afterward,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
new controversy.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.160
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
There's no force feeding.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160
So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it --

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
I would have said, "That's kind of true."

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.160
and that's what you get when you want foie gras.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
is utterly simple.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And he said to me, really from the first moment,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160
my life's work is to give the geese what they want.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
I'm just here to give the geese what they want.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160
taking pictures of them

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
like his children in the grass.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Amazing.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
He's really just in love with -- he's at one with --

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
he's the goose whisperer.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
(Laughter)

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
like I'm speaking to you now, right,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160
but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160
because the more I got to know him and his system,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.160
the more exciting this whole idea became.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160
He kept going like this to me.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
so you know, I slowed down.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And finally, by the end of the day I was like,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Ed-uar-do, you know like this?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
But he was still going like this.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
I figured it out.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
I was speaking too loudly.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
So I hushed my voice.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
in kind of a half whisper.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And he stopped doing this.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around --

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
"Get the hell away from this kid!" --

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Right up to us, like right up to here.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Right along the fence line.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
And fence line was amazing in itself.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
it's totally backward with him.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
The electricity on this fiberglass fence

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
is only on the outside.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
He rewired it. He invented it.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
I've never seen it. Have you?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160
He doesn't.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
He electrifies only the outside.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
Why?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.160
and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.160
the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
with figs and everything else.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
He felt like they felt manipulated.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
So he got rid of the electricity,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
he got rid of current on the inside

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160
and kept it on the outside,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
Now, what happened?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
They ate, and he showed me on a chart,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.160
how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
The landscape is incredible.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
I mean, his farm is incredible.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
It really is the Garden of Eden.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
There's figs and everything else there for the taking.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area --

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
what does Extremadura mean?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Extra hard land, right?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Extra difficult. Extra hard.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
But over four generations, he and his family

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.160
have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Upgrades the life for these geese.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
And they are allowed to take whatever they want.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Another irony, the double irony

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160
is that on the figs and the olives,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Eduardo can make more money selling those

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
than he can on the foie gras.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
He doesn't care.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
He lets them take what they want and he says,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Part of the income for his farm.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
A big part of his income for his farm.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
But he never controls it.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.160
They get what they want,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
they leave the rest for me and I sell it.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.160
His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.160
which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.160
That's how I've been trained.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
You want to look and see what good foie gras is,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
it's got to be bright yellow.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Well, because he doesn't force feed,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
his livers were pretty grey.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Or they were.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.160
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
And the geese love the Lupin bush.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Not for the bush, but for the seeds.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Radioactive yellow.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Bright yellow.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
(Laughter)

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
and it was always nature.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
It was never him.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
into working with his landscape.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
but increasingly, eating up his every word.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.160
And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And he grabs my arm and the translator's,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
"Shush, watch this."

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
And this squadron of geese come over.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160
[Clapping]

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
they're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160
And then they circle around.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160
[Clapping]

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160
And the wild geese are calling down.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
[Clapping]

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160
and they land.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
And I'm just saying, "No way."

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
(Laughter)

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
No way.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
And I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160
and I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
to say come for a visit?"

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160
And he says, "No, no, no.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
They've come to stay."

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
They've come to stay?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
(Laughter)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.160
It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
I said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
He said, "No, no, no.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.160
Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
To happiness.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
They find it here.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
They don't need anything more."

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.160
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
and his flock continues.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Think about that for a minute.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.160
It's brilliant, right?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farm

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160
in, like, North Carolina,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.160
and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
and decides to stay.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160
(Laughter)

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
So how did it taste?

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
I finally got to taste it before I left.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
It was incredible.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160
you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
this guy's a genius, you know?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
I'm really in love with him at this point.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
I'd had something that was called foie gras.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
But this was transformative. Really transformative.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
And I say to you, I might not stick to this,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.160
but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.160
because of that taste experience with Eduardo.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160
It was sweet, it was unctuous.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.160
It had all the qualities of foie gras,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.160
And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160
I was sure of it.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
And I'm not like some super taster, you know?

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
But I can taste things.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
There's 100 percent star anise in there.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
And he says, "No."

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160
And I ended up like going down the spices,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
But no.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
he sticks them in this jar

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and he confits it.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
What?

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
We went back out for the final tour of the farm,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
and he showed me the wild pepper plants

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160
and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160
He doesn't need salt and pepper.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.160
And he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
that his geese love to gorge on.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160
I turned to him at the end of the meal,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
and it's a question I asked several times,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
some of the greatest chefs in the world are --

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
How come you don't give him this?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
How come no one's really heard of you?"

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160
And it may be because of the wine,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160
or it may be because of my excitement,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160
he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
(Laughter)

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.160
And he was right.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.160
He was right.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
They create a dish

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.160
where all the vectors point at us.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.160
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
And as he said, I think fittingly,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.160
it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160
Simple.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
I really was moved.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.160
is this note that says, when asked,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160
what do you think of conventional foie gras?

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160
What do you think of foie gras that

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.160
99.99999 percent of the world eats?

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
He said, "I think it's an insult to history."

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
And I wrote, insult to history.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.160
It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160
What the hell does that mean?

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Insult to history.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
So I did some research when I got back,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
and here's what I found.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.160
The history of foie gras.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.160
Jews invented foie gras.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
True story.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
True story.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
By accident.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160
They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Gotten sick of the chicken fat.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160
They were looking for an alternative.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.160
beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.160
And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
The Pharaoh got wind of this --

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
This is true, right off the Internet.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter)

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
I swear to God.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160
(Laughter)

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
He tasted it and fell in love with it.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160
He started demanding it.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160
And the Jews, fearing for their life,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
had to come up with an ingenious idea,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
And they invented, what? Gavage.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:11.160
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
and the good stuff they kept for themselves.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
That's the history of foie gras.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160
And if you think about it,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.160
it's the history of industrial agriculture.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
It's the history of what we eat today.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
Most of what we eat today.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
long-distance travel, food processing.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
All of it, our food system.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.160
That's also an insult to history.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.160
It's an insult to the basic laws of nature

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160
and of biology.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
Whether we're talking about beef cattle

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
or we're talking about chickens,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.160
or in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish --

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.160
which wholesale are going out of business.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.160
Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
It's rooted in extraction.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
Take more, sell more, waste more.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.160
And for the future it won't serve us.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
Jonas Salk has a great quote.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
He said, "If all the insects disappeared,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:39.160
life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:46.160
If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
And he's right.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:56.160
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160
Really new.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.160
One in which we stop treating the planet

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.160
as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.160
And stop degrading resources under the guise of

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
cheap food.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.160
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160
Farmers that rely on nature

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.160
for solutions, for answers,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
rather than imposing solutions on nature.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.160
Listening as Janine Benyus,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.160
one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.160
"Listening to nature's operating instructions."

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.160
That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:42.160
is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:49.160
and for people that care about food and cooking,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.160
is that the most ecological choice for food

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
is also the most ethical choice for food.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.160
And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.160
but almost always, the most delicious choice.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160
That's serendipitous.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160
Thank you.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.160
(Applause)
