00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.431
Most of you can probably relate
to what I'm feeling right now.

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:19.158
My heart is racing in my chest.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.007
My palms are a little bit clammy.

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:23.857
I'm sweating.

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:26.793
And my breath is a little bit shallow.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:30.178
Now, these familiar sensations
are obviously the result

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.585
of standing up
in front of a thousand of you

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.870
and giving a talk
that might be streamed online

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:37.062
to perhaps a million more.

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.665
But the physical sensations
I'm experiencing right now

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.834
are actually the result of a much more
basic mind-body mechanism.

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:47.521
My nervous system is sending
a flood of hormones

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.470
like cortisol and adrenaline
into my bloodstream.

00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:55.818
It's a very old and very necessary
response that sends blood and oxygen

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.921
to the organs and muscles
that I might need

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.233
to respond quickly to a potential threat.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:03.056
But there's a problem with this response,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.536
and that is, it can get over-activated.

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:09.244
If I face these kinds of stressors
on a daily basis,

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.861
particularly over an extended
period of time,

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.391
my system can get overloaded.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:19.084
So basically, if this response
happens infrequently: super-necessary

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.360
for my well-being and survival.

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:22.921
But if it happens too much,

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.687
it can actually make me sick.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.479
There's a growing body of research
examining the relationship

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:30.589
between chronic stress and illness.

00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:32.702
Things like heart disease and even cancer

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.291
are being shown to have
a relationship to stress.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.810
And that's because, over time,
too much activation from stress

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.795
can interfere with my body's processes
that keep me healthy.

00:01:44.793 --> 00:01:47.443
Now, let's imagine for a moment
that I was pregnant.

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.373
What might this kind of stress,

00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:52.666
particularly over the length
of my pregnancy,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.530
what kind of impact might that have

00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:56.986
on the health of my developing fetus?

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.513
You probably won't be surprised
when I tell you

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.911
that this kind of stress
during pregnancy is not good.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:07.566
It can even cause the body
to initiate labor too early,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.256
because in a basic sense,
the stress communicates

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.463
that the womb is no longer
a safe place for the child.

00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.530
Stress during pregnancy is linked
with things like high blood pressure

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.213
and low infant birth weight,

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.429
and it can begin a cascade
of health challenges

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.616
that make birth much more dangerous

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.645
for both parent and child.

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:30.006
Now of course stress,
particularly in our modern lifestyle,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.320
is a somewhat universal experience, right?

00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:34.684
Maybe you've never stood up
to give a TED Talk,

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:37.362
but you've faced a big
presentation at work,

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:38.954
a sudden job loss,

00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:40.291
a big test,

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.941
a heated conflict
with a family member or friend.

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:46.892
But it turns out that the kind
of stress we experience

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.130
and whether we're able to stay
in a relaxed state long enough

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.205
to keep our bodies working properly

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.507
depends a lot on who we are.

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:57.116
There's also a growing body of research

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.118
showing that people who experience
more discrimination

00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:03.053
are more likely to have poor health.

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.131
Even the threat of discrimination,

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:09.597
like worrying you might be stopped
by police while driving your car,

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:13.140
can have a negative impact on your health.

00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:17.266
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.757
the person who pioneered
the tools that have proven these linkages,

00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:23.734
says that the more marginalized
groups in our society

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:27.565
experience more discrimination
and more impacts on their health.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:31.634
I've been interested in these issues
for over a decade.

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.466
I became interested in maternal health

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.235
when a failed premed trajectory
instead sent me down a path

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.728
looking for other ways
to help pregnant people.

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:42.176
I became a doula,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.223
a lay person trained to provide support

00:03:44.247 --> 00:03:46.367
to people during pregnancy and childbirth.

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.975
And because I'm Latina
and a Spanish speaker,

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.908
in my first volunteer doula gig
at a public hospital in North Carolina,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.255
I saw clearly how race and class
impacted the experiences

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.911
of the women that I supported.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.004
If we take a look at the statistics
about the rates of illness

00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:03.831
during pregnancy and childbirth,

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.993
we see clearly the pattern
outlined by Dr. Williams.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.782
African-American women in particular

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.715
have an entirely different
experience than white women

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.533
when it comes to whether
their babies are born healthy.

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:19.392
In certain parts of the country,
particularly the Deep South,

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:22.129
the rates of mother
and infant death for black women

00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:25.673
actually approximate
those rates in Sub-Saharan African.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.261
In those same communities,

00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:30.858
the rates for white women are near zero.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.135
Even nationally, black women
are four times more likely

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.451
to die during pregnancy and childbirth

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:39.713
than white women.

00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:42.410
Four times more likely to die.

00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:46.011
They're also twice as likely
for their infants to die

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.616
before the first year of life

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.171
than white infants,

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.112
and two to three times more likely

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.052
to give birth too early or too skinny --

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:55.986
a sign of insufficient development.

00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:00.854
Native women are also more likely
to have higher rates of these problems

00:05:00.878 --> 00:05:02.076
than white women,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.341
as are some groups of Latinas.

00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:08.106
For the last decade as a doula
turned journalist and blogger,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.845
I've been trying to raise the alarm

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:12.840
about just how different
the experiences of women of color,

00:05:12.864 --> 00:05:14.319
but particularly black women,

00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:17.142
are when it comes to pregnancy
and birth in the US.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.062
But when I tell people
about these appalling statistics,

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.817
I'm usually met with an assumption
that it's about either poverty

00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:25.492
or lack of access to care.

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:29.364
But it turns out, neither of these things
tell the whole story.

00:05:29.388 --> 00:05:33.900
Even middle-class black women
still have much worse outcomes

00:05:33.924 --> 00:05:36.503
than their middle-class
white counterparts.

00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:39.390
The gap actually widens among this group.

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:43.893
And while access to care
is definitely still a problem,

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:47.356
even women of color who receive
the recommended prenatal care

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.294
still suffer from these high rates.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.104
And so we come back to the path

00:05:52.128 --> 00:05:56.279
from discrimination to stress
to poor health,

00:05:56.303 --> 00:06:00.500
and it begins to paint a picture
that many people of color know to be true:

00:06:00.524 --> 00:06:02.930
racism is actually making us sick.

00:06:04.108 --> 00:06:05.772
Still sound like a stretch?

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:10.080
Consider this: immigrants,
particularly black and Latina immigrants,

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:13.643
actually have better health when
they first arrive in the United States.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:18.232
But the longer they stay in this country,
the worse their health becomes.

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:22.368
People like me, born in the United States
to Cuban immigrant parents,

00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:26.122
are actually more likely to have
worse health than my grandparents did.

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:29.051
It's what researchers call
"the immigrant paradox,"

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:30.359
and it further illustrates

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:32.586
that there's something
in the US environment

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.829
that is making us sick.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.665
But here's the thing:

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.756
this problem, that racism
is making people of color,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.461
but especially black
women and babies, sick, is vast.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.255
I could spend all of my time
with you talking about it,

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.934
but I won't, because I want to make sure
to tell you about one solution.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.391
And the good news is, it's a solution
that isn't particularly expensive,

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:53.881
and doesn't require
any fancy drug treatments

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:55.091
or new technologies.

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.767
The solution is called, "The JJ Way."

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.221
Meet Jennie Joseph.

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:03.792
She's a midwife
in the Orlando, Florida area

00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:07.048
who has been serving
pregnant women for over a decade.

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.489
In what she calls her easy-access clinics,

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:14.134
Jennie and her team provide prenatal care
to over 600 women per year.

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:19.419
Her clients, most of whom are black,
Haitian and Latina,

00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:21.067
deliver at the local hospital.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.468
But by providing accessible
and respectful prenatal care,

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:27.992
Jennie has achieved something remarkable:

00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:32.580
almost all of her clients give birth
to healthy, full-term babies.

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:35.672
Her method is deceptively simple.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:38.872
Jennie says that all of her appointments
start at the front desk.

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:42.636
Every member of her team,
and every moment a women is at her clinic,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.770
is as supportive as possible.

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:47.615
No one is turned away
due to lack of funds.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:51.776
The JJ Way is to make the finances work
no matter what the hurdles.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.794
No one is chastised for showing up
late to their appointments.

00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:56.922
No one is talked down to or belittled.

00:07:57.594 --> 00:08:01.831
Jennie's waiting room feels more like
your aunt's living room than a clinic.

00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:04.806
She calls this space
"a classroom in disguise."

00:08:05.512 --> 00:08:07.911
With the plush chairs
arranged in a circle,

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:10.595
women wait for their appointments
in one-on-one chats

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:11.852
with a staff educator,

00:08:11.876 --> 00:08:13.717
or in group prenatal classes.

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.104
When you finally are called back
to your appointment,

00:08:17.128 --> 00:08:18.975
you are greeted by Alexis or Trina,

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.888
two of Jennie's medical assistants.

00:08:20.912 --> 00:08:24.431
Both are young, African-American
and moms themselves.

00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.649
Their approach is casual and friendly.

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:28.900
During one visit I observed,

00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:31.851
Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.746
while she took her blood pressure.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.741
This Latina mom was having trouble
keeping food down due to nausea.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.233
As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,

00:08:40.257 --> 00:08:43.075
she said, "We'll see about changing
your prescription, OK?

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.739
We can't have you not eating."

00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:49.580
That "we" is actually a really crucial
aspect of Jennie's model.

00:08:49.604 --> 00:08:54.363
She sees her staff as part of a team that,
alongside the woman and her family,

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:55.761
has one goal:

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.270
get mom to term with a healthy baby.

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:02.778
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis
are actually the center of her care model,

00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:06.450
and that her role as a provider
is just to support their work.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.444
Trina spends a lot of her day
on her cell phone,

00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:11.880
texting with clients
about all sorts of things.

00:09:11.904 --> 00:09:15.781
One woman texted to ask if a medication
she was prescribed at the hospital

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.743
was OK to take while pregnant.

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.444
The answer was no.

00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:23.791
Another woman texted with pictures
of an infant born under Jennie's care.

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:27.670
Lastly, when you finally are called back
to see the provider,

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:30.423
you've already taken your own weight
in the waiting room,

00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:32.825
and done your own pee test
in the bathroom.

00:09:32.849 --> 00:09:35.688
This is a big departure
from the traditional medical model,

00:09:35.712 --> 00:09:38.600
because it places
responsibility and information

00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:40.353
back in the woman's hands.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:43.896
So rather than a medical setting
where you might be chastised

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.372
for not keeping up
with provider recommendations --

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:49.442
the kind of settings often available
to low-income women --

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:52.449
Jennie's model is to be
as supportive as possible.

00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:56.014
And that support provides a crucial buffer

00:09:56.038 --> 00:10:00.973
to the stress of racism and discrimination
facing these women every day.

00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:05.195
But here's the best thing
about Jennie's model:

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.751
it's been incredibly successful.

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:10.006
Remember those statistics I told you,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.786
that black women are more likely
to give birth too early,

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.962
to give birth to low birth weight babies,

00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:18.516
to even die due to complications
of pregnancy and childbirth?

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.405
Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely
eliminated those problems,

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:24.961
starting with what Jennie calls
"skinny babies."

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:28.090
She's been able to get almost all
her clients to term

00:10:28.114 --> 00:10:30.721
with healthy, chunky babies like this one.

00:10:31.768 --> 00:10:33.372
Audience: Aw!

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.421
Miriam Zoila Pérez:
This is a baby girl

00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.944
born to a client of Jennie's
this past June.

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:42.388
A similar demographic
of women in Jennie's area

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:45.284
who gave birth at the same
hospital her clients did

00:10:45.308 --> 00:10:47.896
were three times more likely to give birth

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.259
to a baby below a healthy weight.

00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:53.735
Jennie is making headway
into what has been seen for decades

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.953
as an almost intractable problem.

00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:58.594
Some of you might be thinking,

00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:01.239
all this one-on-one attention
that The JJ Way requires

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:03.598
must be too expensive to scale.

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.078
Well, you'd be wrong.

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.685
The visit with the provider
is not the center of Jennie's model,

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.240
and for good reason.

00:11:10.264 --> 00:11:13.365
Those visits are expensive,
and in order to maintain her model,

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:15.882
she's got to see a lot
of clients to cover costs.

00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:18.999
But Jennie doesn't have to spend
a ton of time with each woman,

00:11:19.023 --> 00:11:23.445
if all of the members of her team
can provide the support, information

00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:25.344
and care that her clients need.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.565
The beauty of Jennie's model
is that she actually believes

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:32.804
it can be implemented
in pretty much any health care setting.

00:11:32.828 --> 00:11:35.719
It's a revolution in care
just waiting to happen.

00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:39.665
These problems I've been sharing
with you are big.

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:43.101
They come from long histories
of racism, classism,

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:46.013
a society based on race
and class stratification.

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:48.433
They involve elaborate
physiological mechanisms

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:49.612
meant to protect us,

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:52.133
that, when overstimulated,
actually make us sick.

00:11:52.576 --> 00:11:55.538
But if there's one thing I've learned
from my work as a doula,

00:11:55.562 --> 00:11:59.404
it's that a little bit of unconditional
support can go a really long way.

00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:02.297
History has shown that people
are incredibly resilient,

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.204
and while we can't eradicate racism

00:12:04.228 --> 00:12:06.490
or the stress that results
from it overnight,

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:09.714
we might just be able to create
environments that provide a buffer

00:12:09.738 --> 00:12:12.600
to what people of color
experience on a daily basis.

00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:15.854
And during pregnancy,
that buffer can be an incredible tool

00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:18.047
towards shifting the impact of racism

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.566
for generations to come.

00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:21.154
Thank you.

00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:24.437
