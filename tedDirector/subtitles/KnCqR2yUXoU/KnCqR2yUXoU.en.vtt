00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
The early '70s, I was in college.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
It was a very revolutionary time.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
It was a political ferment, so to say --

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
students out in the streets of Paris,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
revolting against authority.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
America was jolted

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
In India, we had the Naxalite movement,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
the [unclear] movement.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
But you know, when there is a political churning of society,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
it unleashes a lot of energy.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
The National Movement of India

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
was testimony to that.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
and jumped into the National Movement.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
Now in the early '70s,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
one of the great programs in India

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
was to revitalize

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
primary science in village schools.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
and returned back as a molecular biologist

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
At 31, he was not able

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
to relate the kind of [unclear] research,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
So he designed and went and started a village science program.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Many people were inspired by this.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
The slogan of the early '70s

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
was "Go to the people.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Live with them; love them.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
Start from what they know. Build on what they have."

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
This was kind of the defining slogan.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
Well I took one year.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
I worked there for two years,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Often one doesn't know what one wants to do,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
And it was a turning point.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
It was a very small village --

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
a weekly bazaar

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
So I just bought one specimen

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
of everything which was sold on the roadside.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
And one thing which I found

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
was this black rubber.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
This is called a cycle valve tube.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
And some of these models --

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles --

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
It's like its own little coupling.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
If you have three of them, and you loop them together,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
well you make a triangle.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
With four, you make a square,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
you make all these kind of polygons.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And they have some wonderful properties.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
If you look at the hexagon, for instance,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
But this is very shaky.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Look at the pentagon, for instance,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
Push it and it becomes house shaped.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
This becomes an isosceles triangle --

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
again, very shaky.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
This square might look very square and prim.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
It becomes kite-shaped.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
But give a child a triangle,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
he can't do a thing to it.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
Why use triangles?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
We can't make a bridge with squares

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Ordinary people know about this

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
because if you go to a village in India,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
they might not have gone to engineering college,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
but no one makes a roof placed like this.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
They always make a triangular roof.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
Now this is people science.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
And if you were to just poke a hole over here

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and put a third matchstick,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
you'll get a T joint.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
And if I were to poke all the three legs of this

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
in the three vertices of this triangle,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
I would make a tetrahedron.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330
So you make all these 3D shapes.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
You make a tetrahedron like this.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.330
And once you make these,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
you make a little house.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Put this on top.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
You just need a ton.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
Now this was -- you make a joint of six,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
you make an icosahedron.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
You can play around with it.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
This makes an igloo.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Now this is in 1978.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
I was a 24-year-old young engineer.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.330
(Applause)

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
which means the little carbon atom.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
Well since then,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
I just thought that I've been really privileged

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
to go to over 2,000 schools in my country --

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
village schools, government schools,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
municipal schools, Ivy League schools --

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
I've been invited by most of them.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
And every time I go to a school,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
Children want to make things. Children want to do things.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
Now this is a little pump

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
with which you could inflate a balloon.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And we have a slogan

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
So all you do is --

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330
it's a very kind of provocative statement --

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And this is how you make a valve.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
You put a little sticky tape.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
This is one-way traffic.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Well we make lots and lots of pumps.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
And this is the other one --

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
and you make two half-cuts.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Now this is what you do,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
is you bend both these legs into a triangle,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
and you just wrap some tape around.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
And this is the pump.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And now, if you have this pump,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
it's like a great, great sprinkler.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
It's like a centrifuge.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
(Applause)

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
you would make this with the palmyra leaf.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Many of our folk toys

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
have great science principles.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
Right.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
There are four pictures.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
You see insects,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
frogs, snakes, eagles.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Here's a paper which you could [unclear] --

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
Arthur Stone,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
But this is great fun for children.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
They all study about the food chain.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
the snakes are eaten by the eagles.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper --

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
A4 size paper --

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school --

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
In three minutes, you just fold this up.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
And you put a little fan here.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
There have been six major research papers on this.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.330
There's some grooves over here, you can see.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And if I take a reed -- if I rub this,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
something very amazing happens.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Six major research papers on this.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
He wrote a paper on this.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
This is there for every child,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and every child can enjoy this.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
If you want to put a colored disk,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
well all these seven colors coalesce.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
that white light's made of seven colors,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
just by spinning this around.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
This is a straw.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
This is a kind of a blowing straw.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
I just put this inside this.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
There's a hole here, and I shut this.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
And this costs very little money to make --

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
great fun for children to do.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
What we do

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
is make a very simple electric motor.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
This is an old bicycle tube,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
This is a permanent magnet.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
It's the interaction of both these magnets

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
which makes this motor spin.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
We made 30,000.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
When teachers make it, children make it.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
You can see a gleam in their eye.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
They get a thrill

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
of what science is all about.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
And this science is not a rich man's game.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
In a democratic country,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
science must reach to our most oppressed,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
to the most marginalized children.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
This program started with 16 schools

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and spread to 1,500 government schools.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Over 100,000 children learn science this way.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
And we're just trying to see possibilities.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Look, this is the tetrapak --

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
awful materials from the point of view of the environment.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum --

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
which are are sealed together.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
They are fused together, so you can't separate them.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
Now you can just make a little network like this

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and fold them and stick them together

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
and make an icosahedron.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
So something which is trash,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
which is choking all the seabirds,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous --

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
all the platonic solids can be made with things like this.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
This is a little straw,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.330
and what you do is you just nip two corners here,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
You put this in your mouth, and you blow.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
(Honk)

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.330
It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
You're not able to see how the sound is produced,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
(Honk)

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
with wire vibrations.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
The other is that you keep blowing at it,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
keep making the sound,

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
and you keep cutting it.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And something very, very nice happens.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:57.330
(Honk)

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
(Applause)

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
And when you get a very small one --

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
(Honk)

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
Well before I go any further,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
this is something worth sharing.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
This is a touching slate meant for blind children.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
and this is my drawing pen,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
which is basically a film box.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.330
It's basically like a fisherman's line,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
a fishing line.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
And this is wool over here.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
Wool sticks on Velcro.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
There are 12 million blind children in our country --

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
(Applause)

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
who live in a world of darkness.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.330
And this has come as a great boon to them.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330
There's a factory out there making our children blind,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
not able to provide them with food,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
not able to provide them with vitamin A.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
But this has come as a great boon for them.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
There are no patents. Anyone can make it.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
This is very, very simple.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.330
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
These are two magnets.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
Small pulley and two strong magnets.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
There will be a spinning magnetic field.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
And you can see, this LED is going to glow.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
So this is a small crank generator.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Well, this is, again,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
And what you can do

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
is just, if you give it a twirl,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
well they just keep going on.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
And imagine a bunch of kids

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
standing in a circle

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.330
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
Well in the end, what we can also do:

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
we use a lot of old newspapers

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
to make caps.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
We make lots of toys with newspapers,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
and this is one of them.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
And this is -- you can see --

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.330
this is a flapping bird.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
And if you have one of these birds --

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.330
children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
And you can see,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
this is a little fantail bird.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
It goes very slowly.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
And there were lots of passengers on the ship,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And the captain would wear a cap everyday

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
and join in the regalia.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
like a captain's cap.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
he would give it one more fold,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap --

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
with a little shoot just like a designer cap,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
because it protects the spinal cord.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
And the second night, he would take the same cap

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
and give it another fold.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap --

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
just like an adventurer's cap.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
And the third night, he would give it two more folds --

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
and this is a very, very famous cap.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
If you've seen any of our Bollywood films,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
this is what the policeman wears,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
it's called a zapalu cap.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
It's been catapulted to international glory.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
So that's a ship.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And now the end:

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
everyone was enjoying the journey very much.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.330
They were singing and dancing.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
A huge wave comes and slaps the front

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
and knocks it down.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
And there's a third one over here.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
And the ship sinks,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.330
and the captain has lost everything,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
but for a life jacket.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Thank you so much.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:24.330
(Applause)
