00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Actually, I think it'll eventually

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
be seen as probably the single biggest idea

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
that's emerged in the past century.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
It's the idea of computation.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Now, of course, that idea has brought us

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
all of the computer technology we have today and so on.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
whose effects we've only just begun to see.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Well, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
working on three large projects

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that really try to take the idea of computation seriously.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
So I started off at a young age as a physicist

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
using computers as tools.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Then, I started drilling down,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
thinking about the computations I might want to do,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and how they could be automated as much as possible.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Eventually, I created a whole structure

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
based on symbolic programming and so on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that let me build Mathematica.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we've been pouring more and more ideas

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and capabilities and so on into Mathematica,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
in R &amp; D and education,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
lots of other areas.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Well, I have to admit, actually,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I wanted to use it myself,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
400 years ago.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
but at the computational universe.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So we normally think of programs as being

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
complicated things that we build

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
for very specific purposes.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
But what about the space of all possible programs?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Here's a representation of a really simple program.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So, if we run this program,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
this is what we get.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Very simple.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So let's try changing the rule

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
for this program a little bit.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Now we get another result,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
still very simple.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Try changing it again.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
You get something a little bit more complicated.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
But if we keep running this for a while,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
it has a very regular structure.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So the question is: Can anything else happen?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Well, we can do a little experiment.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Let's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Let's just run all possible programs

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
of the particular type that we're looking at.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
They're called cellular automata.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Most of them do very simple things,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
but if you look along all these different pictures,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
at rule number 30,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
you start to see something interesting going on.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So let's take a closer look

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
at rule number 30 here.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So here it is.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
but we're getting all this amazing stuff.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
It's not at all what we're used to,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and I must say that, when I first saw this,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
it came as a huge shock to my intuition.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And, in fact, to understand it,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I eventually had to create

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
a whole new kind of science.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
(Laughter)

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
This science is different, more general,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
than the mathematics-based science that we've had

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
for the past 300 or so years.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
how nature, seemingly so effortlessly,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
manages to produce so much

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that seems to us so complex.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Well, I think we've found its secret:

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and quite often getting things like Rule 30

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
or like this.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And knowing that starts to explain

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
a lot of long-standing mysteries in science.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
It also brings up new issues, though,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
like computational irreducibility.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
but something like this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
is fundamentally irreducible.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
The only way to find its outcome

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
is, effectively, just to watch it evolve.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
It's connected to, what I call,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the principle of computational equivalence,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
which tells us that even incredibly simple systems

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
can do computations as sophisticated as anything.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
to be able to do arbitrary computation;

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
just something that happens, naturally,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
all over the place.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Things with rules as simple as these can do it.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
Well, this has deep implications

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
about the limits of science,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
about predictability and controllability

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
of things like biological processes or economies,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
about intelligence in the universe,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
about questions like free will

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and about creating technology.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
You know, in working on this science for many years,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I kept wondering,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
"What will be its first killer app?"

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Well, ever since I was a kid,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and somehow making it computable.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
300 years earlier.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But I'd always assumed that to make progress,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Well, then I got to thinking:

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different --

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
and, by the way, I've now got

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
huge computation capabilities in Mathematica,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
to do large, seemingly crazy, projects --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
So I decided to just try to see

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
we could make computable.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So, it's been a big, very complex project,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
which I was not sure was going to work at all.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And last year we were able

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
to release the first website version

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
of Wolfram Alpha.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
that computes answers to questions.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
So let's give it a try.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Let's start off with something really easy.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Hope for the best.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Very good. Okay.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So far so good.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
(Laughter)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Let's try something a little bit harder.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
Let's do

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
some mathy thing,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and with luck it'll work out the answer

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and try and tell us some interesting things

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
things about related math.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
We could ask it something about the real world.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Let's say -- I don't know --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
what's the GDP of Spain?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And it should be able to tell us that.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Now we could compute something related to this,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
let's say ... the GDP of Spain

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
divided by, I don't know,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
the -- hmmm ...

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
let's say the revenue of Microsoft.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
(Laughter)

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
The idea is that we can just type this in,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
this kind of question in, however we think of it.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So let's try asking a question,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
like a health related question.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So let's say we have a lab finding that ...

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
you know, we have an LDL level of 140

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
for a male aged 50.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
So let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
will go and use available public health data

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and try and figure out

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Or let's try asking about, I don't know,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
the International Space Station.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And what's happening here is that

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
it's computing, in real time,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
where the International Space Station is right now at this moment,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
how fast it's going, and so on.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
It's got, by now,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
pretty good coverage of everything you might find

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
in a standard reference library.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
But the goal is to go much further

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
and, very broadly, to democratize

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
all of this knowledge,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and to try and be an authoritative

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
source in all areas.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
not by searching what other people

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
may have written down before,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
but by using built in knowledge

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
to compute fresh new answers to specific questions.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Now, of course, Wolfram Alpha

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is a monumentally huge, long-term project

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
with lots and lots of challenges.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
For a start, one has to curate a zillion

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
different sources of facts and data,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and human domain experts for doing this.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
But that's just the beginning.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Given raw facts or data

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
to actually answer questions,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
one has to compute:

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
one has to implement all those methods and models

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and algorithms and so on

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
that science and other areas have built up over the centuries.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Well, even starting from Mathematica,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
this is still a huge amount of work.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
So far, there are about 8 million lines

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
built by experts from many, many different fields.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Well, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
is that you can just ask it questions

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
using ordinary human language,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
which means that we've got to be able to take

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
all those strange utterances that people type into the input field

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and understand them.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And I must say that I thought that step

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
might just be plain impossible.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Two big things happened:

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
that came from studying the computational universe;

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
completely changes how one can

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
set about understanding language.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And, of course, now

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
we can learn from its actual usage.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And, in fact, there's been

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
an interesting coevolution that's been going on

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
between Wolfram Alpha

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and its human users,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and it's really encouraging.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Right now, if we look at web queries,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And if you look at things like the iPhone app,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
the fraction is considerably larger.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
But, in many ways,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and we're getting more confident.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
showing up in more and more places,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
working both with this kind of public data, like on the website,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and with private knowledge

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
for people and companies and so on.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
a whole new kind of computing

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that one can call knowledge-based computing,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
in which one's starting not just from raw computation,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And when one does that, one really changes

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
the economics of delivering computational things,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
whether it's on the web or elsewhere.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
You know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
On the one hand, we have Mathematica,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
with its sort of precise, formal language

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and a huge network

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
of carefully designed capabilities

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
able to get a lot done in just a few lines.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Let me show you a couple of examples here.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Here's something where we're sort of

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
integrating a bunch of different capabilities here.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Here we'll just create, in this line,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
a little user interface that allows us to

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
do something fun there.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
If you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and creating user interface and so on.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
But it's something that is very precise stuff.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
It's a precise specification with a precise formal language

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
that causes Mathematica to know what to do here.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
with all the messiness of the world

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and human language and so on built into it.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So what happens when you put these things together?

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I think it's actually rather wonderful.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
you can, for example, make precise programs

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that call on real world data.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
Here's a real simple example.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
You can also just sort of give vague input

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and then try and have Wolfram Alpha

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
figure out what you're talking about.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Let's try this here.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
But actually I think the most exciting thing about this

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
is that it really gives one the chance

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
to democratize programming.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
I mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Then, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
what precise pieces of code

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
can do what they're asking for

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
to build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
So, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
will be able to do the whole thing immediately

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Here's a big website

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
where we've been collecting lots of educational

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
I'll show you one example here.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
This is just an example of one of these computable documents.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
This is probably a fairly small

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
piece of Mathematica code

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
that's able to be run here.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Okay. Let's zoom out again.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So, given our new kind of science,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
is there a general way to use it to make technology?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
So, with physical materials,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
we're used to going around the world

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and discovering that particular materials

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
are useful for particular

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
technological purposes.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
in the computational universe.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
The challenge is to see how to

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
harness them for human purposes.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Something like Rule 30, for example,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
turns out to be a really good randomness generator.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Other simple programs are good models

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
for processes in the natural or social world.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
are actually now full of algorithms

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
that we discovered by searching the computational universe.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
And, for example, this -- if we go back here --

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
this has become surprisingly popular

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
among composers

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
finding musical forms by searching the computational universe.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
In a sense, we can use the computational universe

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
to get mass customized creativity.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
I'm hoping we can, for example,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
use that even to get Wolfram Alpha

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
that no engineer

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Well, so, that leads to kind of an ultimate question:

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
we might find our physical universe?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
some simple program for our universe.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Well, the history of physics would have us believe

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
But in the computational universe,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
If the rules for the universe are simple,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
it's kind of inevitable that they have to be

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
very abstract and very low level;

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
operating, for example, far below

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
the level of space or time,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
which makes it hard to represent things.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
But in at least a large class of cases,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
one can think of the universe as being

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
like some kind of network,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
which, when it gets big enough,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
behaves like continuous space

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
in much the same way as having lots of molecules

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
can behave like a continuous fluid.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
little rules that progressively update this network.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
And each possible rule, in a sense,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
corresponds to a candidate universe.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Actually, I haven't shown these before,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
but here are a few of the candidate universes

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that I've looked at.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Some of these are hopeless universes,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
completely sterile,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
no notion of time, no matter,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
other problems like that.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
is that you actually don't have to go very far

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
in the computational universe

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
before you start finding candidate universes

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
that aren't obviously not our universe.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Here's the problem:

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Any serious candidate for our universe

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
is inevitably full of computational irreducibility.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Which means that it is irreducibly difficult

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
to find out how it will really behave,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
and whether it matches our physical universe.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
that successfully reproduce special relativity,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
and even general relativity and gravitation,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
So, will we find the whole of physics?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
I don't know for sure,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
but I think at this point it's sort of

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
almost embarrassing not to at least try.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Not an easy project.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
One's got to build a lot of technology.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
One's got to build a structure that's probably

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
at least as deep as existing physics.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
But I'll tell you, here today,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
that I'm committed to seeing this project done,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to see if, within this decade,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
we can finally hold in our hands

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
the rule for our universe

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
and know where our universe lies

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
in the space of all possible universes ...

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,"

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
and have it tell us.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
(Laughter)

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
So I've been working on the idea of computation

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
now for more than 30 years,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
into millions of lines of code

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
and grist for server farms and so on.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
With every passing year,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
I realize how much more powerful

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
the idea of computation really is.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
It's taken us a long way already,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
but there's so much more to come.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
From the foundations of science

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
to the limits of technology

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
to the very definition of the human condition,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
I think computation is destined to be

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
the defining idea of our future.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Thank you.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:47.260
(Applause)

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
Chris Anderson: That was astonishing.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
Stay here. I've got a question.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.260
(Applause)

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.260
So, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
Are you able to say in a sentence or two

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
how this type of thinking

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
could integrate at some point

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
as the fundamental explanations of the universe?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
that we kind of know to be true,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
things like the standard model of physics:

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
or it's simply wrong.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
with string theory and so on

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
have been an interesting exploration

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
that has tried to get back to the standard model,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
but hasn't quite gotten there.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
may actually have considerable resonance

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
with what's been done in string theory,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
but that's a complicated math thing

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.260
that I don't yet know how it's going to work out.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
CA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
He also has shown how complexity

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
can arise out of a simple start.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
Does your work relate to his?

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
SW: I think so.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
as one of the founding contributions

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
to this kind of area.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
Benoit has been particularly interested

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
in nested patterns, in fractals and so on,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
where the structure is something

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
that's kind of tree-like,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
and even smaller branches and so on.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
That's one of the ways

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
that you get towards true complexity.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
get us to a different level.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
In fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
because they seem to be things that are

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
capable of complexity

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.260
I could go on about this at great length, but I won't. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
CA: Stephen Wolfram, thank you.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.260
(Applause)
