00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:21.831
(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path
of destruction here in town.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.773
... pulling trees from the ground,
shattering windows,

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:26.566
taking the roofs off of homes ...

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:29.672
Caitria O'Neill: That was me

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.053
in front of our house in Monson,
Massachusetts last June.

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:36.418
After an EF3 tornado ripped
straight through our town

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:37.921
and took parts of our roof off,

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:39.990
I decided to stay in Massachusetts,

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:41.919
instead of pursuing the master's program

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:44.742
I had moved my boxes
home that afternoon for.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.997
Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1,
we weren't disaster experts,

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.095
but on June 3, we started faking it.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.125
This experience changed our lives,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.586
and now we're trying
to change the experience.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.055
CO: So, tornadoes
don't happen in Massachusetts,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.580
and I was cleverly standing in the front
yard when one came over the hill.

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:03.904
After a lamppost flew by, my family
and I sprinted into the basement.

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:06.824
Trees were thrown against the house,
the windows exploded.

00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:08.717
When we finally got out the back door,

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:10.718
transformers were burning in the street.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.472
MO: I was here in Boston.

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:14.213
I'm a PhD student at MIT,

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:16.530
and I happen to study atmospheric science.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.291
Actually, it gets weirder --

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.609
I was in the museum of science
at the time the tornado hit,

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.464
playing with the tornado display --

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:24.666
(Laughter)

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.841
so I missed her call.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:29.609
I get a call from Caitria, hear the news,
and start tracking the radar online

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:33.063
to call the family back when another
supercell was forming in their area.

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:35.528
I drove home late that night
with batteries and ice.

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:37.865
We live across the street
from a historic church

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.554
that had lost its very
iconic steeple in the storm.

00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:43.043
It had become a community
gathering place overnight.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:46.371
The town hall and the police department
had also suffered direct hits,

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:50.025
and so people wanting to help
or needing information went to the church.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.084
CO: We walked to the church because
we heard they had hot meals,

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:54.980
but when we arrived, we found problems.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.449
There were a couple large,
sweaty men with chainsaws

00:01:57.473 --> 00:02:00.883
standing in the center of the church,
but nobody knew where to send them

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:03.206
because no one knew the extent
of the damage yet.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.381
As we watched, they became
frustrated and left

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.360
to go find somebody to help on their own.

00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:10.043
MO: So we started organizing.
Why? It had to be done.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:13.510
We found Pastor Bob and offered to give
the response some infrastructure.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.706
And then, armed with just
two laptops and one air card,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.820
we built a recovery machine.

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:23.342
(Applause)

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:26.374
CO: That was a tornado, and everyone's
heading to the church

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.064
to drop things off and volunteer.

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:29.668
MO: Everyone's donating clothing.

00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:32.086
We should inventory
the donations piling up here.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.047
CO: And we need a hotline.
Can you make a Google Voice number?

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.653
MO: Sure. And we need to tell people
what not to bring.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:40.090
I'll make a Facebook account.
Can you print flyers?

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:43.170
CO: Yeah, but we don't even know
what houses are accepting help.

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:45.199
We need to canvas and send out volunteers.

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.336
MO: We need to tell people
what not to bring.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.364
Hey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:52.412
CO: You got my number off the news?
We don't need more freezers!

00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:56.440
(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it?
CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:58.088
Together: Someone get me Post-its!

00:02:58.112 --> 00:02:59.113
(Laughter)

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:02.814
CO: And then the rest of the community
figured out that we had answers.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:06.479
MO: I can donate three water heaters,
but someone needs to come pick them up.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:08.050
CO: My car is in my living room!

00:03:08.074 --> 00:03:10.899
MO: My boyscout troop
would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.793
CO: My puppy is missing and insurance
doesn't cover chimneys.

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:16.880
MO: My church group of 50
would like housing and meals for a week

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:18.234
while we repair properties.

00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:21.171
CO: You sent me to that place
on Washington Street yesterday,

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:22.849
and now I'm covered in poison ivy.

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:23.972
(Laughter)

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:25.762
So this is what filled our days.

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:28.000
We had to learn
how to answer questions quickly

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:30.274
and to solve problems in a minute or less;

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:32.498
otherwise, something
more urgent would come up,

00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:33.856
and it wouldn't get done.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.687
MO: We didn't get our authority
from the board of selectmen

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:39.567
or the emergency management
director or the United Way.

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.217
We just started answering questions
and making decisions

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:44.876
because someone -- anyone -- had to.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.255
And why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.447
I'm good at Facebook.

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:49.749
And there's two of me.

00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:51.319
(Laughter)

00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:54.871
CO: The point is, if there's a flood
or a fire or a hurricane,

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.656
you, or somebody like you,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.291
are going to step up
and start organizing things.

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:01.592
The other point is that it is hard.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.307
MO: Lying on the ground
after another 17-hour day,

00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:06.138
Caitria and I would empty our pockets

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.926
and try to place dozens of scraps
of paper into context --

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.816
all bits of information
that had to be remembered and matched

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.068
in order to help someone.

00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:15.251
After another day
and a shower at the shelter,

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.448
we realized it shouldn't be this hard.

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:20.317
CO: In a country like ours
where we breathe Wi-Fi,

00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:23.872
leveraging technology for a faster
recovery should be a no-brainer.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.440
Systems like the ones
that we were creating on the fly

00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:27.757
could exist ahead of time.

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:31.310
And if some community member
is in this organizing position

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.880
in every area after every disaster,

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:35.706
these tools should exist.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.216
MO: So, we decided to build them:

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.750
a recovery in a box, something that
could be deployed after every disaster

00:04:41.774 --> 00:04:43.270
by any local organizer.

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:47.080
CO: I decided to stay in the country,
give up the master's in Moscow

00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:49.168
and to work full-time to make this happen.

00:04:49.192 --> 00:04:50.685
In the course of the past year,

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:54.169
we've become experts in the field
of community-powered disaster recovery.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.677
And there are three main problems
that we've observed

00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:58.391
with the way things work currently.

00:04:58.756 --> 00:04:59.907
MO: The tools.

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.866
Large aid organizations are exceptional
at bringing massive resources to bear

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.053
after a disaster,

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:08.492
but they often fulfill very specific
missions, and then they leave.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:12.734
This leaves local residents to deal with
the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,

00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:13.917
thousands of donations,

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:15.948
and all with no training and no tools.

00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:19.100
So they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.

00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:22.338
But none of these tools allow you
to value high-priority information

00:05:22.362 --> 00:05:24.831
amidst all of the photos and well-wishes.

00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:26.165
CO: The timing.

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.357
Disaster relief is essentially
a backwards political campaign.

00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:32.103
In a political campaign,
you start with no interest

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.309
and no capacity to turn that into action.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.544
You build both gradually,

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:38.719
until a moment of peak mobilization
at the time of the election.

00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:41.478
In a disaster, however,
you start with all of the interest

00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:42.818
and none of the capacity.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.914
And you've only got about seven days

00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:48.377
to capture 50 percent of all
of the Web searches that will ever be made

00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:49.816
to help your area.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.427
Then some sporting event happens,

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.467
and you've got only the resources
that you've collected thus far

00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:56.844
to meet the next five years
of recovery needs.

00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:59.870
This is the slide for Katrina.

00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:02.405
This is the curve for Joplin.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.553
And this is the curve
for the Dallas tornadoes in April,

00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:06.927
where we deployed software.

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:08.413
There's a gap here.

00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:12.162
Affected households have to wait
for the insurance adjuster to visit

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:14.924
before they can start accepting help
on their properties.

00:06:14.948 --> 00:06:17.930
And you've only got about four days
of interest in Dallas.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.420
MO: Data.

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:22.278
Data is inherently unsexy,

00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:24.524
but it can jump-start an area's recovery.

00:06:24.548 --> 00:06:27.565
FEMA and the state will pay
85 percent of the cost

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:29.184
of a federally-declared disaster,

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.849
leaving the town to pay
the last 15 percent of the bill.

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:33.482
Now that expense can be huge,

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:37.460
but if the town can mobilize X amount
of volunteers for Y hours,

00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:42.325
the dollar value of that labor used
goes toward the town's contribution.

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:43.677
But who knows that?

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.264
Now try to imagine
the sinking feeling you get

00:06:46.288 --> 00:06:50.136
when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers
and you can't prove it.

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:53.319
CO: These are three problems
with a common solution.

00:06:53.343 --> 00:06:56.372
If we can get the right tools
at the right time

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:58.362
to the people who will inevitably step up

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:00.741
and start putting
their communities back together,

00:07:00.765 --> 00:07:03.467
we can create new standards
in disaster recovery.

00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.425
MO: We needed canvasing tools,
donations databasing,

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.439
needs reporting, remote volunteer access,

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.310
all in an easy-to-use website.

00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:12.771
CO: And we needed help.

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:15.959
Alvin, our software engineer
and co-founder, has built these tools.

00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:20.054
Chris and Bill have volunteered their time
to use operations and partnerships.

00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:23.570
And we've been flying into disaster areas
since this past January,

00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:25.943
setting up software, training residents

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:30.205
and licensing the software to areas
that are preparing for disasters.

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.055
MO: One of our first launches
was after the Dallas tornadoes

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:34.230
this past April.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.884
We flew into a town
that had a static, outdated website

00:07:36.908 --> 00:07:39.874
and a frenetic Facebook feed,
trying to structure the response,

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:41.286
and we launched our platform.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.552
All of the interest came
in the first four days,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.546
but by the time they lost the news cycle,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.007
that's when the needs came in,

00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.201
yet they had this massive resource
of what people were able to give

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:52.989
and they've been able to meet
the needs of their residents.

00:07:53.013 --> 00:07:55.069
CO: So it's working,
but it could be better.

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:57.771
Emergency preparedness is a big deal
in disaster recovery

00:07:57.795 --> 00:08:00.044
because it makes towns safer
and more resilient.

00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:02.959
Imagine if we could have
these systems ready to go in a place

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.756
before a disaster.

00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:07.040
So that's what we're working on.

00:08:07.064 --> 00:08:10.273
We're working on getting the software
to places so people expect it,

00:08:10.297 --> 00:08:11.638
so people know how to use it

00:08:11.662 --> 00:08:13.444
and so it can be filled ahead of time

00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:15.850
with that micro-information
that drives recovery.

00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:17.707
MO: It's not rocket science.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:19.950
These tools are obvious
and people want them.

00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:22.402
In our hometown,
we trained a half-dozen residents

00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:24.148
to run these Web tools on their own,

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:26.360
because Caitria and I
live here, in Boston.

00:08:26.384 --> 00:08:29.360
They took to it immediately,
and now they are forces of nature.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.339
There are over three volunteer groups
working almost every day,

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.371
and have been since June 1 of last year,

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:37.978
to make sure these residents get what
they need and get back in their homes.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.325
They have hotlines
and spreadsheets and data.

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.439
CO: And that makes a difference.

00:08:42.463 --> 00:08:46.317
June 1 this year marked the one-year
anniversary of the Monson tornado,

00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:49.634
and our community's never been
more connected or more empowered.

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:53.890
We've been able to see the same
transformation in Texas and in Alabama.

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:55.737
Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT

00:08:55.761 --> 00:08:57.826
to fly in and fix problems
after a disaster;

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.174
it takes a local.

00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:02.053
No matter how good an aid organization
is at what they do,

00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:03.752
they eventually have to go home.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.990
But if you give locals the tools,

00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:08.819
if you show them
what they can do to recover,

00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:10.398
they become experts.

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:13.291
(Applause)

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:14.467
MO: All right. Let's go.

00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.720
(Applause)
