00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.439
So, Ma was trying to explain
something to me

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:17.254
about Grandma and when they grew up,

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:18.985
but I couldn't pay attention to her

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.941
because I was five years old,
and I was petrified.

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.950
I had just seen The Green Lady.

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:27.973
Now, about a week earlier,
I'd watched that movie "Godzilla,"

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:31.144
the one about that huge lizard-like beast
storming a major city,

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:35.485
and the thought of a green monster
coming for me was stuck in my mind.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.139
And yet there I was,
at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:40.944
just staring at her:

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:42.127
her horns,

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:43.312
her muscles --

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:44.717
all of it just frightened me.

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.114
And I didn't know
whether she was a monster or a hero.

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:52.360
So I decided to consult
the Google of the day --

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:53.664
"Ma! Ma!"

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:55.584
(Laughter)

00:00:55.608 --> 00:01:00.049
My mother explained that The Green Lady
is actually the Statue of Liberty

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:02.344
and that she was waving immigrants in.

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:06.663
Now, the part of her explanation
that really messed with my young head

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:09.322
was the fact that, according to Ma,

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:11.379
long before us,

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.555
The Green Lady was actually brown,

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.555
brown like me,

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.045
and that she changed
colors over the years,

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:21.238
much like America.

00:01:21.262 --> 00:01:26.556
Now, the part that really
is intriguing about this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.211
is that when she changed colors,

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:29.976
she made me think about myself.

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.876
It all made sense to me,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.897
because as a first-generation American,

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.398
I was surrounded by immigrants.

00:01:35.422 --> 00:01:39.232
In fact, within my immediate social circle
of the people who support me,

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:40.544
who enrich my life,

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:42.455
at least two are foreign-born.

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:46.851
My life as a US citizen is in many ways
shaped by newcomers,

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.034
and chances are,

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.510
so is yours.

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:53.187
There are more than 40 million
immigrants in the USA.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.721
According to census data,

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:59.407
a quarter of the nation's children
have at least one foreign-born parent.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.542
I know all these statistics
because I study global migration patterns.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.728
I'm a journalist,
and for the last few years,

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.159
I've been documenting
the lives of US citizens

00:02:09.183 --> 00:02:11.111
who've lost people to deportation.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.438
And the numbers are enormous.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.584
From 2008 to 2016,

00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:19.902
more than three million people
were "ordered removed" --

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:22.953
that's the technical term
for being deported.

00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:28.932
There is an economic, a political,
a psychological and an emotional cost

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:30.852
to those deportations --

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.678
the moments when these circles are broken.

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:35.448
I once asked a US soldier,

00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:37.807
"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"

00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.010
And she told me,

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.020
"Because I'm proud to defend my country."

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:42.210
But I pressed to know --

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:44.091
"Really, when you're on base,

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.354
and you hear bombs
exploding in the distance,

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:50.155
and you see soldiers coming back
who are gravely injured,

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:54.338
in that moment,
when you know you could be next,

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:55.993
what does 'my country' mean?"

00:02:56.806 --> 00:02:57.956
She looked at me.

00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:00.435
"My country is my wife,

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.773
my family,

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.357
my friends, my soldiers."

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:04.698
What she was telling me

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:08.090
is that "my country" is a collection
of these strong relationships;

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:09.983
these social circles.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:12.626
When the social circles are weakened,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.682
a country itself is weaker.

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:18.845
We're missing a crucial aspect
in the debate about immigration policy.

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.892
Rather than focusing on individuals,

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:23.943
we should focus
on the circles around them,

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.956
because these are the people
who are left behind:

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.860
the voters, the taxpayers,

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:31.162
the ones who are suffering that loss.

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:33.468
And it's not just the children
of the deported

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:34.833
who are impacted.

00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:37.734
You have brothers and sisters
who are separated by borders.

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:40.565
You have classmates, teachers,
law enforcement officers,

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.821
technologists, scientists, doctors,

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.563
who are all scrambling
to make sense of new realities

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:49.019
when their social circles are broken.

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:53.540
These are the real lives
behind all these statistics

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.012
that dominate discussions
about immigration policy.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.997
But we don't often think about them.

00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:59.534
And I'm trying to change that.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.874
Here's just one of the real-life stories
that I've collected.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.918
And it still haunts me.

00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:10.227
I met Ramon and his son in 2016,

00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:13.787
the same year both of them
were being ordered out of the country.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.349
Ramon was being deported to Latin America,

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:21.698
while his son, who was a sergeant
in the US military,

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:23.291
was being deployed.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.798
Deported ...

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.679
deployed.

00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:31.294
If you just look at Ramon's case,

00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:34.586
it wouldn't be clear how deeply
connected to the country he is.

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:36.627
But consider his son:

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.982
a US citizen defending a country
that's banished his father.

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.382
The social circle is what's key here.

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:47.384
Here's another example
that illustrates those critical bonds.

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:50.746
A group of citizens in Philadelphia
were concerned about their jobs,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.761
because the legal owner
of the restaurant where they worked

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:55.525
was an undocumented immigrant,

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:57.825
and immigration officials
had picked him up.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:04:59.561
They rallied behind him.

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.008
An immigration lawyer argued

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:03.206
he was too important
to the local community

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.678
to be deported.

00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:08.760
At the hearing, they even submitted
restaurant reviews --

00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:10.053
restaurant reviews!

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:15.313
In the end, a judge exercised
what's called "judicial discretion"

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:17.273
and allowed him to stay in the country,

00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:20.783
but only because they considered
the social circle.

00:05:21.647 --> 00:05:26.410
There are 23 million
noncitizens in the USA,

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:28.502
according to verifiable federal data.

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.688
And that doesn't include the undocumented,

00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:34.066
because numbers for that population
are at best complex estimates.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.348
Let's just work with what we have.

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:39.414
That's 23 million social circles --

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:42.343
about 100 million individuals

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:45.466
whose lives could be impacted
by deportation.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.663
And the stress of it all is trickling down
through the population.

00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:52.962
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.759
found that 30 percent
of citizens in LA County

00:05:56.783 --> 00:05:59.104
are stressed about deportation,

00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:02.104
not because they themselves
could be removed,

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:06.869
but rather, because members
of their social circle were at risk.

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:10.518
I am not suggesting that no one
should ever be deported;

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:12.393
don't confuse me with that.

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:16.584
But what I am saying is that we need
to look at the bigger picture.

00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:20.045
If you are within the sound of my voice,

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.519
I want you to close your eyes for a moment

00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:25.172
and examine your own social circle.

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:27.536
Who are your foreign-born?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.874
What would it feel like
if the circle were broken?

00:06:32.488 --> 00:06:33.833
Share your story.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.174
I'm building a global archive
of first-person accounts

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.459
and linking them with mapping technology,

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:43.387
so that we can see exactly
where these circles break,

00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:46.485
because this is not
just an American issue.

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:50.037
There are a quarter-billion migrants
around the world;

00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:54.136
people living, loving and learning
in countries where they were not born.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.792
And in my career, in my life,
I've been one of them:

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.798
in China, in Africa, in Europe.

00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:02.972
And each time I become
one of these foreigners --

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:06.149
one of these strange-looking
guys in a new land --

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:08.142
I can't help but think back to that day

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.522
when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.450
all those decades ago,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.072
when I was scared,

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:16.727
and I had just spotted that green lady.

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:21.730
And I guess the question
that I keep on thinking about

00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:23.006
when I see her

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.290
and all the younger replicas of her
that are so obviously brown,

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:30.127
and even the paintings
that showcase her in the beginning

00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:32.257
as not quite green --

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:35.239
when I look at all of that,

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:39.386
the question that my research
seeks to answer

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.707
becomes, to me, the same one
that confounded me all those years ago:

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:46.092
Is she a monster

00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:48.266
or a hero?

00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:50.421
Thank you.

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:53.467
(Applause)
