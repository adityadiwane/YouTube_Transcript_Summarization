00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want to talk about

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
what we learn from conservatives.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
so I want to confess to you

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that when I was a kid,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
indeed, I was a conservative.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
a leader in the Teenage Republicans.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Indeed, I was the youngest member

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
of any delegation

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
to be the Republican nominee for president.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And indeed, this is just one of the examples

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
of the junk that flows across the tubes

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
in these Internets here.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Wikipedia reports that this guy,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
at the Republican National Convention,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
but it's just not true.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
(Laughter)

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
(Laughter)

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
(Applause)

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Perfect.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Laughter)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
Okay.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Finally, truth will be brought here.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
That's it. Please save this.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Great, here we go.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.260
(Applause)

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
the thing to think about is this:

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They go to church.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And I'm not talking about the God thing.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
They go to church, by which I mean,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
they do lots of things for free for each other.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
They hold potluck dinners.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
They serve food to poor people.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
They share, they give,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
they give away for free.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And it's the very same people

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
leading Wall Street firms

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
who, on Sundays, show up

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and share.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And not only food, right.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
These very same people

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
are strong believers, in lots of contexts,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
in the limits on the markets.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
They are in many important places

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
against markets.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But they're very keen that we don't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
let money drop into that relationship,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
else it turns into something like this.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
They want to regulate us, those conservatives,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Because they understand:

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
There are places for the market

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and places where the market should not exist,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
where we should be free

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
to enjoy the fellowship of others.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And the second great thing about conservatives:

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
they get ecology.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
who taught us about

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
They first taught us about ecology

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
in the context of natural resources.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And then they began to teach us in the context of

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
innovation, economics.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
They understand, in that context,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
"free." They understand "free" is an important

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
essential part of the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
cultural ecology as well.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
That's the thing I want you to think about them.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now, I know

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
you don't believe me, really, here.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So here's exhibit number one.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
a libertarian who works at the, for many people,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
"evil" Cato Institute.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Okay, so Julian made this video.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
He's a terrible producer of videos,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So here he is beginning.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
remix culture seems to be evolving ...

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
about these three videos.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
set to Lisztomania.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Which, of course, spread virally.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Hugely successful.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
(Music)

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
They decided they wanted to do the same.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.260
(Music)

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:53.260
(Music)

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Here's lesson number one.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
They are acting in the sense that they're

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
emulating the original mashup.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and some experience with video editing.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But this is also basically just a group of friends

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
having an authentic social moment

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and screwing around together.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
with a group of good friends.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
LL: Or ...

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
because here, remix isn't just about

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
an individual doing something alone in his basement;

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
it becomes an act of social creativity.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And it's not just that it yields

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
a different kind of product at the end,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
All of our normal social interactions

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
become a kind of invitation

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to this sort of collective expression.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
It's our real social lives themselves

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
that are transmuted into art.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
JS: One remix is about

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
individuals using our shared culture

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Stage two, social remix,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
is really about using it to mediate

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
people's relationships to each other.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
First, within each video,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
for performing the social reality of each group.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
But there's also a dialogue between the videos,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
where, once the basic structure is established,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
it becomes a kind of platform

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
for articulating the similarities and differences

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
between the groups' social and physical worlds.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
LL: And then, here's for me,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the critical key to what

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Julian has to say ...

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
how to incentivize the production

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
of a certain kind of artistic commodity;

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
it's about what level of control

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
we're going to permit to be exercised

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
over our social realities --

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
social realities that are now inevitably

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
permeated by pop culture.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I think it's important that we

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
If we're only focused on how to maximize

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
the supply of one,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
I think we risk suppressing

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
this different and richer

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
LL: Right. Bingo. Point.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
Freedom needs this opportunity

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
to both have the commercial success

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
of the great commercial works

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and the opportunity

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to build this different kind of culture.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And for that to happen, you need

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
ideas like fair use to be central and protected,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to enable this kind of innovation,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
as this libertarian tells us,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
between these two creative cultures,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
a commercial and a sharing culture.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
The point is they, he, here,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
gets that culture.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Now, my concern is, we Dems,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
too often, not so much.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
All right, take for example this great company.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
All of the great Disney works

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
were works that took works that

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
were in the public domain and remixed them,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
as "Steamboat Willie,"

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
is a remix of the then, very dominant,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
very popular "Steamboat Bill"

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
by Buster Keaton.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
He is the celebration and ideal

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
of exactly this kind of creativity.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
But then the company passes

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
through this dark stage

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
to this Democrat.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Wildly different.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
This is the mastermind behind

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
the eventual passage of what we call

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
extending the term of existing copyrights

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
by 20 years,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
so that no one could do to Disney

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Now, when we tried to challenge this,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
including this right-wing

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
who said he would join our brief

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
only if the word "no brainer"

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
was in the brief somewhere.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
(Laughter)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
But apparently, no brains

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
existed in this place

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
when Democrats passed and signed

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
this bill into law.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
but I don't buy it.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
This guy is no Republican.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Okay, for a second example,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
think about this cultural hero,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
icon on the Left,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
creator of this character.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
inviting people to come and use their creative energy

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
to produce a new generation of attention

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Read the license.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
The license for these remixers

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
assigns all of the rights

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to the remix back to Lucas.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
The mashup is owned by Lucas.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
music you might add,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
to exploit that for free.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
There is no creator here to be recognized.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
The creator doesn't have any rights.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And we should remember

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
who employed the sharecroppers:

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
the Democrats, right?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So the point is the Republicans here

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
recognize that there's a certain need

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
of ownership,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
a respect for ownership,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the respect we should give the creator,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
the remixer, the owner, the property owner,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
the copyright owner

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and not a generation of sharecroppers.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
lessons about openness.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Our lives are sharing activities,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
at least in part.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
at least in part.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
well-protected spaces of fair use.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
That's number one. Number two:

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
This ecology of sharing

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
needs freedom

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
within which to create.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
the ability to create.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And number three: We need to

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
respect the creator,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
the creator of these remixes

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
through rights that are

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
directly tied to them.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Creative Commons.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
but of course -- let me just tie it here --

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
the Creative Commons, which is

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
offering authors this simple way to mark their content

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
with the freedoms

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
they intended to carry.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
to a "some rights reserved" world

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
building and creating

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
on the basis of this

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
creative copyrighted work.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
These tools that we built

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
enable this sharing in parts

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
through licenses that make it clear

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and a freedom to create

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
without requiring permission first

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
because the permission has already been granted

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
and a respect for the creator because it builds upon

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
a copyright the creator

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
has licensed freely.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that's obviously developed around these licenses,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
as now more than 350 million digital objects

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
are out there, licensed freely

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
in this way.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
the picture of an ecology

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
of balanced creativity,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Well, as you all know,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
not many of us believe we do.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
just last week.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
I created a video which was based

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
and I uploaded it to YouTube.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
I then got this email from YouTube

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
weirdly notifying me

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
that there was content in that

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
owned by the mysterious WMG

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
that matched their content ID.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So I didn't think much about it.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
But then I went to the site

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
My whole 45-minute video

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
had been silenced

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
because there were snippets in that video,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
a video about fair use,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that included Warner Music Group music.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
Now, interestingly,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
they still sold ads for that music,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
if you played the silent video.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
You could still buy the music,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
but you couldn't hear anything

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
because it had been silenced.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
So I did what the current regime

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
says I must do

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
to be free to use

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
YouTube to talk about fair use.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And then in an extraordinarily

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
you've actually got to type out these words

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and get them right

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
to reassert your freedom to speak.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
And I felt like I was in third grade again.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
This is absurd.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
It is outrageous.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
we should be encouraging.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
who was the number one, active

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
opponent of this system of regulation

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
in online speech?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
John McCain.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
to be more respectful of fair use

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
with their extraordinary notice and take down system,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
that led his campaign so many times

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
to be thrown off the Internet.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
Now, that was the story of me then,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
my good old days of right-wing lunacy.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Let me come back to now,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
now when I'm a little leftist --

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
And I wonder, can we on the Left

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
expect to build this

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
ecology of freedom, now,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
in a world where

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
we know the extraordinarily powerful

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
influences against it,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
where even icons of the Left like this

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
entertain and push bills

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
that would effectively ban the requirement

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
of open access for government-funded research?

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
The president, who has supported

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
a process that secretly negotiates agreements,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
which effectively lock us into the insane system

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
of DMCA

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
that we have adopted

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
Not a single example of reform

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
has been produced yet.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
And we're not going to see this change

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
in this system

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
anytime soon.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
So here's the lessons of openness

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
that I think we need to learn.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
Openness is a commitment

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
to a certain set of values.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
We need to speak of those values.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
It's a value of the limits in regulation.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
It's a value respecting the creator.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
Now, if we can learn those values

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
from at least some influences on the Right,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
if we can take them and incorporate them,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
maybe we could do a little trade.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260
We learn those values on the Left,

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
and maybe they'll do health care

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
or global warming legislation or something in the Right.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
Anyway, please join me

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
in teaching these values.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
