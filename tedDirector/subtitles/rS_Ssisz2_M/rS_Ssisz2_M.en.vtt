00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:14.159
I want to tell you

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.850
how 20,000 remarkable young people

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.706
from over 100 countries

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.518
ended up in Cuba

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:26.321
and are transforming health in their communities.

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.401
Ninety percent of them would never

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.973
have left home at all

00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:33.317
if it weren't for a scholarship
to study medicine in Cuba

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:35.128
and a commitment to go back

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:38.756
to places like the ones they'd come from —

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:42.203
remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:45.689
to become doctors for people like themselves,

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.781
to walk the walk.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.447
Havana's Latin American Medical School:

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:53.372
It's the largest medical school in the world,

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:56.274
graduating 23,000 young doctors

00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:59.002
since its first class of 2005,

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.611
with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.432
Its mission, to train physicians for the people

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.483
who need them the most:

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:10.419
the over one billion

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:12.682
who have never seen a doctor,

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:16.515
the people who live and die

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:20.009
under every poverty line ever invented.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.259
Its students defy all norms.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530
They're the school's biggest risk

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.990
and also its best bet.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.505
They're recruited from the poorest,

00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:32.076
most broken places on our planet

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:34.350
by a school that believes they can become

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.857
not just the good

00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:37.792
but the excellent physicians

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.545
their communities desperately need,

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:44.197
that they will practice where most doctors don't,

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:46.623
in places not only poor

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:49.176
but oftentimes dangerous,

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:52.202
carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:54.821
or navigating neighborhoods

00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:58.142
riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,

00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:00.842
their home ground.

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:02.168
The hope is that they will help

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:04.768
transform access to care,

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:07.187
the health picture in impoverished areas,

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.346
and even the way medicine itself

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.889
is learned and practiced,

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.140
and that they will become pioneers in our global reach

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.660
for universal health coverage,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.378
surely a tall order.

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:25.504
Two big storms and this notion of "walk the walk"

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:29.588
prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.

00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:32.591
The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:34.143
had ripped through the Caribbean

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:36.348
and Central America,

00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:38.727
leaving 30,000 dead

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:41.610
and two and a half million homeless.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.303
Hundreds of Cuban doctors
volunteered for disaster response,

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:47.148
but when they got there,

00:02:47.148 --> 00:02:49.231
they found a bigger disaster:

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:52.427
whole communities with no healthcare,

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:54.751
doors bolted shut on rural hospitals

00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.630
for lack of staff,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.301
and just too many babies dying

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:02.236
before their first birthday.

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:06.070
What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.784
New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,

00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:10.096
but where would they come from?

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.901
Where would they train?

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:17.344
In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:20.269
was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.620
to become the Latin American Medical School,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.633
ELAM.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.107
Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.018
were offered to hundreds of students

00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:33.051
from the countries hardest hit by the storms.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:35.330
As a journalist in Havana,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.047
I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.589
in March 1999,

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.305
settling into dorms barely refurbished

00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:46.984
and helping their professors not
only sweep out the classrooms

00:03:46.984 --> 00:03:51.663
but move in the desks and the
chairs and the microscopes.

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:53.542
Over the next few years,

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:55.454
governments throughout the Americas

00:03:55.454 --> 00:03:58.627
requested scholarships for their own students,

00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:00.505
and the Congressional Black Caucus

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.880
asked for and received hundreds of scholarships

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.120
for young people from the USA.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.832
Today, among the 23,000

00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:13.847
are graduates from 83 countries

00:04:13.847 --> 00:04:16.851
in the Americas, Africa and Asia,

00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:22.454
and enrollment has grown to 123 nations.

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:24.658
More than half the students are young women.

00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:26.050
They come from 100 ethnic groups,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.075
speak 50 different languages.

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:31.216
WHO Director Margaret Chan said,

00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:35.254
"For once, if you are poor, female,

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.516
or from an indigenous population,

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.221
you have a distinct advantage,

00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:43.950
an ethic that makes this medical school unique."

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.100
Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.970
on the Atlantic coast of Honduras.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.882
There's no running water,

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.682
no electricity there,

00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:58.282
and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours

00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:01.195
or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:04.490
skirting the waves of the Atlantic.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.131
Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.134
who started grammar school,

00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.878
the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:15.734
known as the Garífuna,

00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:19.210
20 percent of the Honduran population.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.363
The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.

00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:27.850
Luther had to walk three hours every day

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.751
to middle school.

00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:31.832
Only 17 made that trip.

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.936
Only five went on to high school,

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:36.100
and only one to university:

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.121
Luther, to ELAM,

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:42.130
among the first crop of Garífuna graduates.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.000
Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.044
in all of Honduran history.

00:05:48.044 --> 00:05:53.945
Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM.

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:57.145
Big problems need big solutions,

00:05:57.145 --> 00:06:00.937
sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,

00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:03.940
but also solutions that work.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.270
ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.790
to guide them, so they learned the hard way,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.479
by doing and correcting course as they went.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.741
Even the brightest students

00:06:16.741 --> 00:06:18.654
from these poor communities

00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:20.330
weren't academically prepared

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.023
for six years of medical training,

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:26.680
so a bridging course was set up in sciences.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.255
Then came language:

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:31.416
these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.193
indigenous peoples

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.393
who learned Spanish as a second language,

00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:38.190
or Haitians who spoke Creole.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.127
So Spanish became part

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:44.285
of the pre-pre-med curriculum.

00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:47.227
Even so, in Cuba,

00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:50.461
the music, the food, the smells,

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:53.150
just about everything was different,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.155
so faculty became family, ELAM home.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.968
Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:05.000
to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.484
Embracing diversity became a way of life.

00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:11.474
Why have so many countries

00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:13.949
asked for these scholarships?

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.201
First, they just don't have enough doctors,

00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:18.967
and where they do, their distribution

00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:21.409
is skewed against the poor,

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.871
because our global health crisis

00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:26.836
is fed by a crisis in human resources.

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:30.688
We are short four to seven million health workers

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:33.152
just to meet basic needs,

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:35.010
and the problem is everywhere.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.562
Doctors are concentrated in the cities,

00:07:37.562 --> 00:07:40.172
where only half the world's people live,

00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.960
and within cities,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.139
not in the shantytowns or South L.A.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.905
Here in the United States,

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:50.406
where we have healthcare reform,

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:52.954
we don't have the professionals we need.

00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:55.469
By 2020, we will be short

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:59.608
45,000 primary care physicians.

00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:01.765
And we're also part of the problem.

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.232
The United States is the number one importer

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:08.596
of doctors from developing countries.

00:08:08.596 --> 00:08:11.465
The second reasons students flock to Cuba

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.692
is the island's own health report card,

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.662
relying on strong primary care.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.484
A commission from The Lancet

00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:20.990
rates Cuba among the best performing

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.839
middle-income countries in health.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:25.785
Save the Children ranks Cuba

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:30.421
the best country in Latin
America to become a mother.

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:33.410
Cuba has similar life expectancy

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.642
and lower infant mortality than the United States,

00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:38.823
with fewer disparities,

00:08:38.823 --> 00:08:40.623
while spending per person

00:08:40.623 --> 00:08:43.638
one 20th of what we do on health

00:08:43.638 --> 00:08:45.787
here in the USA.

00:08:45.787 --> 00:08:48.779
Academically, ELAM is tough,

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:52.410
but 80 percent of its students graduate.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.756
The subjects are familiar —

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:56.230
basic and clinical sciences —

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.656
but there are major differences.

00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:02.267
First, training has moved out of the ivory tower

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:05.169
and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:08.533
the kinds of places most of these grads will practice.

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:12.627
Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,

00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:17.657
but community-based learning starts on day one.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:21.423
Second, students treat the whole patient,

00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:23.337
mind and body,

00:09:23.337 --> 00:09:25.843
in the context of their 
families, their communities

00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:27.990
and their culture.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.890
Third, they learn public health:

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.990
to assess their patients' drinking water, housing,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.286
social and economic conditions.

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:39.817
Fourth, they are taught

00:09:39.817 --> 00:09:42.584
that a good patient interview

00:09:42.584 --> 00:09:44.688
and a thorough clinical exam

00:09:44.688 --> 00:09:47.523
provide most of the clues for diagnosis,

00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:51.426
saving costly technology for confirmation.

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:54.976
And finally, they're taught over and over again

00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:57.020
the importance of prevention,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.420
especially as chronic diseases

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.580
cripple health systems worldwide.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.770
Such an in-service learning

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.370
also comes with a team approach,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.237
as much how to work in teams

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.183
as how to lead them,

00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:16.310
with a dose of humility.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.110
Upon graduation, these doctors share

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.820
their knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.790
community health workers,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.176
to help them become better at what they do,

00:10:26.176 --> 00:10:28.121
not to replace them,

00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:31.250
to work with shamans and traditional healers.

00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.870
ELAM's graduates:

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.527
Are they proving this audacious experiment right?

00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:42.822
Dozens of projects give us an inkling

00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:45.390
of what they're capable of doing.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.153
Take the Garífuna grads.

00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:49.343
They not only went to work back home,

00:10:49.343 --> 00:10:51.750
but they organized their communities to build

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.151
Honduras' first indigenous hospital.

00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:57.300
With an architect's help,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.777
residents literally raised it from the ground up.

00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:03.959
The first patients walked through the doors

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:06.299
in December 2007,

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.808
and since then, the hospital has received

00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:11.958
nearly one million patient visits.

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.119
And government is paying attention,

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:16.640
upholding the hospital as a model

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.819
of rural public health for Honduras.

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:25.467
ELAM's graduates are smart,

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:28.920
strong and also dedicated.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.274
Haiti, January 2010.

00:11:33.274 --> 00:11:35.109
The pain.

00:11:35.109 --> 00:11:39.112
People buried under 30 million tons of rubble.

00:11:39.112 --> 00:11:41.261
Overwhelming.

00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:43.139
Three hundred forty Cuban doctors

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:45.580
were already on the ground long term.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.983
More were on their way. Many more were needed.

00:11:47.983 --> 00:11:51.227
At ELAM, students worked round the clock

00:11:51.227 --> 00:11:54.445
to contact 2,000 graduates.

00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:57.629
As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,

00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:01.926
27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara

00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:06.414
to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.

00:12:06.414 --> 00:12:09.710
They spoke easily to each other in Spanish

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.399
and listened to their patients in Creole

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.525
thanks to Haitian medical students

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.752
flown in from ELAM in Cuba.

00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:18.440
Many stayed for months,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.218
even through the cholera epidemic.

00:12:21.218 --> 00:12:23.558
Hundreds of Haitian graduates

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:26.280
had to pick up the pieces,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.294
overcome their own heartbreak,

00:12:28.294 --> 00:12:30.160
and then pick up the burden

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.728
of building a new public health system for Haiti.

00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:36.225
Today, with aid of organizations and governments

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:38.778
from Norway to Cuba to Brazil,

00:12:38.778 --> 00:12:41.004
dozens of new health centers have been built,

00:12:41.004 --> 00:12:44.575
staffed, and in 35 cases, headed

00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:48.497
by ELAM graduates.

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:50.365
Yet the Haitian story

00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:52.424
also illustrates some of the bigger problems

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:54.640
faced in many countries.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.384
Take a look:

00:12:56.384 --> 00:13:02.166
748 Haitian graduates by 
2012, when cholera struck,

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:05.912
nearly half working in the public health sector

00:13:05.912 --> 00:13:07.983
but one quarter unemployed,

00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:14.093
and 110 had left Haiti altogether.

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.861
So in the best case scenarios,

00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:18.731
these graduates are staffing

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:21.980
and thus strengthening public health systems,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.159
where often they're the only doctors around.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:27.950
In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.592
in the public health sector,

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:32.158
where most poor people are treated,

00:13:32.158 --> 00:13:34.957
not enough political will, not enough resources,

00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:37.163
not enough anything —

00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:40.616
just too many patients with no care.

00:13:40.616 --> 00:13:43.600
The grads face pressure from their families too,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.903
desperate to make ends meet,

00:13:45.903 --> 00:13:48.479
so when there are no public sector jobs,

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:51.100
these new MDs decamp into private practice,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.115
or go abroad to send money home.

00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:58.300
Worst of all, in some countries,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.236
medical societies influence accreditation bodies

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:04.251
not to honor the ELAM degree,

00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:06.568
fearful these grads will take their jobs

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:10.123
or reduce their patient loads and income.

00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:13.104
It's not a question of competencies.

00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:15.612
Here in the USA, the California Medical Board

00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:19.212
accredited the school after rigorous inspection,

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:21.260
and the new physicians are making good

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.451
on Cuba's big bet,

00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:25.262
passing their boards and accepted

00:14:25.262 --> 00:14:27.647
into highly respected residencies

00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:31.738
from New York to Chicago to New Mexico.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:34.363
Two hundred strong, they're coming

00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:36.748
back to the United States energized,

00:14:36.748 --> 00:14:39.335
and also dissatisfied.

00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:40.966
As one grad put it,

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:44.420
in Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.422
with minimal resources,

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:48.998
so when I see all the resources we have here,

00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:51.160
and you tell me that's not possible,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.330
I know it's not true.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.949
Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work."

00:14:58.949 --> 00:15:00.910
ELAM's graduates,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.427
some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,

00:15:04.427 --> 00:15:07.595
have come from the poorest of the poor

00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:09.928
to offer health, education

00:15:09.928 --> 00:15:12.844
and a voice to their communities.

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:15.496
They've done the heavy lifting.

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:17.510
Now we need to do our part

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.127
to support the 23,000 and counting,

00:15:21.127 --> 00:15:22.481
All of us —

00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:26.115
foundations, residency directors, press,

00:15:26.115 --> 00:15:29.299
entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:31.452
need to step up.

00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:33.443
We need to do much more globally

00:15:33.443 --> 00:15:36.382
to give these new doctors the opportunity

00:15:36.382 --> 00:15:38.775
to prove their mettle.

00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:39.778
They need to be able

00:15:39.778 --> 00:15:42.982
to take their countries' licensing exams.

00:15:42.982 --> 00:15:45.930
They need jobs in the public health sector

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.685
or in nonprofit health centers

00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:51.532
to put their training and commitment to work.

00:15:51.532 --> 00:15:53.815
They need the chance to be

00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:58.674
the doctors their patients need.

00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:00.531
To move forward,

00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:03.523
we may have to find our way back

00:16:03.523 --> 00:16:05.706
to that pediatrician who would

00:16:05.706 --> 00:16:07.393
knock on my family's door

00:16:07.393 --> 00:16:10.579
on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:12.489
who made house calls,

00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:15.380
who was a public servant.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.203
These aren't such new ideas

00:16:17.203 --> 00:16:19.565
of what medicine should be.

00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:22.290
What's new is the scaling up

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.673
and the faces of the doctors themselves:

00:16:25.673 --> 00:16:29.130
an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.060
than a he;

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.987
In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:36.338
an indigenous doctor;

00:16:36.338 --> 00:16:39.352
in the USA, a doctor of color

00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:41.748
who speaks fluent Spanish.

00:16:41.748 --> 00:16:45.427
She is well trained, can be counted on,

00:16:45.427 --> 00:16:49.071
and shares the face and culture of her patients,

00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.480
and she deserves our support surely,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.946
because whether by subway, mule, or canoe,

00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:59.944
she is teaching us to walk the walk.

00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:05.514
Thank you. (Applause)
