00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and dear friend and co-teacher.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Ken and I have been working together

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
for almost 40 years.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
That's Ken Sharpe over there.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
(Applause)

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
So there is among many people --

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
certainly me and most of the people I talk to --

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
a kind of collective dissatisfaction

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
with the way things are working,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
with the way our institutions run.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and they don't have enough time for us.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
We certainly can't trust the bankers,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and we certainly can't trust the brokers.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
They almost brought the entire financial system down.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And even as we do our own work,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
all too often,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
we find ourselves having to choose

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
between doing what we think is the right thing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and doing the expected thing,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
or the required thing,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
or the profitable thing.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
So everywhere we look,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
pretty much across the board,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
we worry that the people we depend on

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
don't really have our interests at heart.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Or if they do have our interests at heart,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
we worry that they don't know us well enough

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
to figure out what they need to do

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
in order to allow us

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
to secure those interests.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
They don't understand us.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
They don't have the time to get to know us.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
There are two kinds of responses

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that we make

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
to this sort of general dissatisfaction.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
If things aren't going right,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
the first response is:

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
let's make more rules,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
let's set up a set

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
of detailed procedures

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
to make sure that people will do the right thing.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Give teachers scripts

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
to follow in the classroom,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
so even if they don't know what they're doing

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and don't care about the welfare of our kids,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
as long as they follow the scripts,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
our kids will get educated.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
to impose for crimes,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
so that you don't need to rely

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
on judges using their judgment.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Instead, all they have to do

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is look up on the list

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Impose limits

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
on what credit card companies can charge in interest

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and on what they can charge in fees.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
More and more rules

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to protect us

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
against an indifferent, uncaring

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
set of institutions we have to deal with.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Or -- or maybe and --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
in addition to rules,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
let's see if we can come up

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
with some really clever incentives

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
so that, even if the people we deal with

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
don't particularly want to serve our interests,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
it is in their interest

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
to serve our interest --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
the magic incentives

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
that will get people to do the right thing

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
even out of pure selfishness.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So we offer teachers bonuses

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
if the kids they teach

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
score passing grades on these big test scores

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
that are used to evaluate

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the quality of school systems.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Rules and incentives --

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
"sticks" and "carrots."

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
We passed a bunch of rules

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
to regulate the financial industry

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
in response to the recent collapse.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
There's the Dodd-Frank Act,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
by Elizabeth Warren.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Maybe these rules

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
will actually improve

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the way these financial services companies behave.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
We'll see.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
In addition, we are struggling

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
to find some way to create incentives

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
for people in the financial services industry

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that will have them more interested

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
in serving the long-term interests

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
even of their own companies,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
rather than securing short-term profits.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
So if we find just the right incentives,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
they won't drive us all over a cliff.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that you need to reign in the bankers.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
it is that.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
But what we believe,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and what we argue in the book,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
is that there is no set of rules,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
no matter how detailed,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
no matter how specific,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
no matter how carefully monitored

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and enforced,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
there is no set of rules

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that will get us what we need.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Why? Because bankers are smart people.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
And, like water,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
they will find cracks

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
in any set of rules.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
You design a set of rules that will make sure

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
that the particular reason

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
why the financial system "almost-collapse"

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
can't happen again.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
It is naive beyond description

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to think that having blocked

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
this source of financial collapse,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
as not to protect ourselves against that.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
What we desperately need,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
beyond, or along with, better rules

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and reasonably smart incentives,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
is we need virtue.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
We need character.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
We need people who want to do the right thing.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And in particular,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
the virtue that we need most of all

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
is the virtue that Aristotle called

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
"practical wisdom."

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Practical wisdom

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
is the moral will

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to do the right thing

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and the moral skill

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
to figure out what the right thing is.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So Aristotle was very interested in watching

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
how the craftsmen around him worked.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And he was impressed

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
at how they would improvise

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
novel solutions to novel problems --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
problems that they hadn't anticipated.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
So one example is he sees these stonemasons

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
working on the Isle of Lesbos,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and they need to measure out

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
round columns.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
Well if you think about it,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
So what do they do?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
They fashion a novel solution to the problem.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
They created a ruler that bends,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
what we would call these days a tape measure --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
a flexible rule,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
a rule that bends.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And Aristotle said,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to design rounded columns,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
you need to bend the rule."

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And Aristotle said

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
often in dealing with other people,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
we need to bend the rules.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Dealing with other people

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
demands a kind of flexibility

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
that no set of rules can encompass.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Wise people know when and how

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to bend the rules.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Wise people know how to improvise.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
they are kind of like jazz musicians.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
The rules are like the notes on the page,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and that gets you started,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
but then you dance around the notes on the page,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
coming up with just the right combination

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
for this particular moment

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
with this particular set of fellow players.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
So for Aristotle,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
the kind

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
of rule-bending,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
rule exception-finding and improvisation

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that you see in skilled craftsmen

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is exactly what you need

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
to be a skilled moral craftsman.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And in interactions with people,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
almost all the time,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
it is this kind of flexibility that is required.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
A wise person knows when to bend the rules.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
A wise person knows when to improvise.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And most important,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in the service of the right aims.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
mostly to serve yourself,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
So it matters that you do this wise practice

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
in the service of others

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and not in the service of yourself.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And so the will to do the right thing

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
is just as important as the moral skill

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
of improvisation

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and exception-finding.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Together they comprise practical wisdom,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
which Aristotle thought

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
was the master virtue.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
So I'll give you an example

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
of wise practice in action.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
It's the case of Michael.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Michael's a young guy.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
He had a pretty low-wage job.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
He was supporting his wife and a child,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and the child was going to parochial school.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Then he lost his job.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
He panicked

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
about being able to support his family.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
One night, he drank a little too much,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and he robbed a cab driver --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
stole 50 dollars.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
He robbed him at gunpoint.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
It was a toy gun.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
He got caught. He got tried.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
He got convicted.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
required a minimum sentence for a crime like this

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
of two years, 24 months.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
thought that this made no sense.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
He had never committed a crime before.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
He was a responsible husband and father.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
He had been faced with desperate circumstances.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
All this would do is wreck a family.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
and not only that,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
but release every day to go to work.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
He did. He served out his sentence.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
He made restitution

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and found himself a new job.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And the family was united.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And it seemed on the road

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
to some sort of a decent life --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
a happy ending to a story

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
involving wise improvisation

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
from a wise judge.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
But it turned out

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
the prosecutor was not happy

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and sort of invented her own,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and so he appealed.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
for armed robbery.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
He did after all have a toy gun.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
is five years.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
He won the appeal.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Judge Forer had to follow the law.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And by the way, this appeal went through

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
after he had finished serving his sentence,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
so he was out and working at a job

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and taking care of his family

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and he had to go back into jail.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Judge Forer did what she was required to do,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and then she quit the bench.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And Michael disappeared.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So that is an example,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
both of wisdom in practice

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and the subversion of wisdom

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Now consider Ms. Dewey.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
She found herself listening to a consultant one day

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
who was trying to help teachers

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
boost the test scores of the kids,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
so that the school

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
would reach the elite category

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in percentage of kids passing big tests.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
All these schools in Texas compete with one another

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
to achieve these milestones,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and there are bonuses and various other treats

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
that come if you beat the other schools.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
So here was the consultant's advice:

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
first, don't waste your time on kids

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Second, don't waste your time

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
on kids who can't pass the test

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
no matter what you do.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Third, don't waste your time

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
on kids who moved into the district

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
too late for their scores to be counted.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Focus all of your time and attention

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
on the kids who are on the bubble,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
the so-called "bubble kids" --

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
kids where your intervention

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
can get them just maybe over the line

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
from failing to passing.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So Ms. Dewey heard this,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
and she shook her head in despair

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and nodding approvingly.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It's like they were about to go play a football game.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
For Ms. Dewey,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
this isn't why she became a teacher.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Now Ken and I are not naive,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
and we understand that you need to have rules.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
You need to have incentives.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
People have to make a living.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But the problem

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
with relying on rules and incentives

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
is that they demoralize

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
professional activity,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
and they demoralize professional activity

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
in two senses.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
First, they demoralize the people

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
who are engaged in the activity.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Judge Forer quits,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And second,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
they demoralize the activity itself.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
The very practice is demoralized,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
and the practitioners are demoralized.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
It creates people --

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
it creates people

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
who are addicted to incentives.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
That is to say, it creates people

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
who only do things for incentives.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Now the striking thing about this

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
is that psychologists have known this

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
for 30 years.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Psychologists have known

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
for 30 years.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
they stop caring about the drawing

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and care only about the reward.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
If you reward kids for reading books,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
they stop caring about what's in the books

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and only care about how long they are.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
they stop caring about educating

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and only care about test preparation.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
If you were to reward doctors

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
for doing more procedures --

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
which is the current system -- they would do more.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
they will do fewer.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
What we want, of course,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
and do the right amount for the right reason --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Psychologists have known this for decades,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
and it's time for policymakers

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
to start paying attention

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
and listen to psychologists a little bit,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
instead of economists.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And it doesn't have to be this way.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
We identify one set of people

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
in all of these practices

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
who we call canny outlaws.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
These are people

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
who, being forced to operate

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
in a system that demands rule-following

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and creates incentives,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
find away around the rules,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
find a way to subvert the rules.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And so what they do is they follow the scripts,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
but they follow the scripts at double-time

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and squirrel away little bits of extra time

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
during which they teach in the way

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
that they actually know is effective.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
and they're incredibly admirable,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
in the face of a system

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
that either roots them out

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
or grinds them down.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
So canny outlaws are better than nothing,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
sustaining that for an indefinite period of time.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
More hopeful

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
are people we call system-changers.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
These are people who are looking

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
not to dodge the system's rules and regulations,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
but to transform the system,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and we talk about several.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
One in particular

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
is a judge named Robert Russell.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
And one day he was faced

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
with the case of Gary Pettengill.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
who had planned to make the army a career,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and that forced him to take a medical discharge.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
He was married, he had a third kid on the way,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
and recurrent nightmares,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and he had started using marijuana

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
to ease some of the symptoms.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and take care of his family.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
So he started selling marijuana.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
He was busted in a drug sweep.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
His family was kicked out of their apartment,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
and the welfare system

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
was threatening to take away his kids.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Under normal sentencing procedures,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Judge Russell would have had little choice

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
as a drug felon.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
But Judge Russell did have an alternative.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
And that's because he was in a special court.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
In the Veterans' Court --

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
this was the first of its kind in the United States.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
It was a court only for veterans

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
who had broken the law.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
And he had created it exactly because

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
mandatory sentencing laws

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
were taking the judgment out of judging.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
No one wanted non-violent offenders --

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
to be thrown into prison.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
They wanted to do something about what we all know,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
And what the Veterans' Court did,

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
was it treated each criminal as an individual,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
tried to get inside their problems,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
tried to fashion responses to their crimes

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
Stayed with them, followed up on them,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260
had been jointly developed

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
to get them over the hump.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
There are now 22 cities

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
that have Veterans' Courts like this.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
Why has the idea spread?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
Well, one reason is

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260
that Judge Russell

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
has now seen 108 vets

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
in his Veterans' Court

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
as of February of this year,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
and out of 108,

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
guess how many have gone back through

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
the revolving door of justice

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
into prison.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
None. None.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
Anyone would glom onto

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
a criminal justice system

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
that has this kind of a record.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.260
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
There's a banker

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
who created a for-profit community bank

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
encouraged bankers who worked there to do well

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
by doing good for their low-income clients.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
The bank helped finance the rebuilding

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.260
of what was otherwise a dying community.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.260
Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.260
the default rate was extremely low.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260
The bank was profitable.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
They serviced the loans.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
They made sure that their loan recipients

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
were staying up with their payments.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.260
Banking hasn't always been

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.260
the way we read about it now in the newspapers.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.260
Even Goldman Sachs

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.260
once used to serve clients,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.260
before it turned into an institution

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.260
that serves only itself.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
Banking wasn't always this way,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.260
and it doesn't have to be this way.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
So there are examples like this in medicine --

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.260
doctors at Harvard

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
who are trying to transform medical education,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.260
so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.260
and loss of empathy,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.260
which characterizes most medical students

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260
in the course of their medical training.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.260
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
patients who they follow for an entire year.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
So the patients are not organ systems,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.260
and they're not diseases;

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
they're people, people with lives.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.260
And in order to be an effective doctor,

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.260
you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.260
mentoring of one student by another,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.260
of all the students by the doctors,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.260
and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.260
who do have time for the people they treat.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
We'll see.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.260
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.260
Each of them shows that it is possible

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.260
to build on and nurture character

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.260
and keep a profession

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.260
true to its proper mission --

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.260
what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.260
And Ken and I believe

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.260
that this is what practitioners actually want.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.260
People want to be allowed

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.260
to be virtuous.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.260
They want to have permission to do the right thing.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
They don't want to feel

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.260
like they need to take a shower

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.260
to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.260
when they come home from work.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.260
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.260
was the key to happiness,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.260
and he was right.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.260
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.260
on what makes people happy,

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.260
and the two things that jump out in study after study --

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.260
I know this will come as a shock to all of you --

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.260
the two things that matter most to happiness

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.260
are love and work.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.260
Love: managing successfully

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.260
relations with the people who are close to you

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.260
and with the communities of which you are a part.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.260
Work: engaging in activities

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.260
that are meaningful and satisfying.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.260
If you have that, good close relations with other people,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.260
work that's meaningful and fulfilling,

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.260
you don't much need anything else.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.260
Well, to love well and to work well,

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.260
you need wisdom.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.260
Rules and incentives don't tell you

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.260
how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.260
how to be a good spouse,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.260
or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.260
or a good teacher.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.260
Rules and incentives

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.260
are no substitutes for wisdom.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.260
Indeed, we argue,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.260
there is no substitute for wisdom.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260
And so practical wisdom

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
does not require

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.260
heroic acts of self-sacrifice

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.260
on the part of practitioners.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.260
In giving us the will and the skill

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.260
to do the right thing -- to do right by others --

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.260
practical wisdom also gives us

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.260
the will and the skill

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.260
to do right by ourselves.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.260
Thanks.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.260
(Applause)
