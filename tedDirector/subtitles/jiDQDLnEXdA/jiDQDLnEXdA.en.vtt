00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.407
Your company launches
a search for an open position.

00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:19.214
The applications start rolling in,

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:22.226
and the qualified candidates
are identified.

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:24.986
Now the choosing begins.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.458
Person A: Ivy League,
4.0, flawless resume,

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.366
great recommendations.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.133
All the right stuff.

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:40.785
Person B: state school,
fair amount of job hopping,

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.039
and odd jobs like cashier
and singing waitress.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:49.238
But remember -- both are qualified.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.164
So I ask you:

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:53.218
who are you going to pick?

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:57.551
My colleagues and I created
very official terms

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:01.142
to describe two distinct
categories of candidates.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.314
We call A "the Silver Spoon,"

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:09.610
the one who clearly had advantages
and was destined for success.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.838
And we call B "the Scrapper,"

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.934
the one who had to fight
against tremendous odds

00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.224
to get to the same point.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.740
You just heard a human resources
director refer to people

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.488
as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:26.513
(Laughter)

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:30.916
which is not exactly politically correct
and sounds a bit judgmental.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.340
But before my human resources
certification gets revoked --

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:36.484
(Laughter)

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:37.889
let me explain.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.063
A resume tells a story.

00:01:41.087 --> 00:01:44.417
And over the years, I've learned
something about people

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:47.660
whose experiences read
like a patchwork quilt,

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:51.160
that makes me stop and fully consider them

00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.794
before tossing their resumes away.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.115
A series of odd jobs may indicate

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.558
inconsistency, lack of focus,
unpredictability.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:07.431
Or it may signal a committed
struggle against obstacles.

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:11.704
At the very least, the Scrapper
deserves an interview.

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.162
To be clear,

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:17.439
I don't hold anything
against the Silver Spoon;

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:20.929
getting into and graduating
from an elite university

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.723
takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:28.364
But if your whole life has been
engineered toward success,

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:30.517
how will you handle the tough times?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.624
One person I hired felt that
because he attended an elite university,

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:38.511
there were certain assignments
that were beneath him,

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:43.640
like temporarily doing manual labor
to better understand an operation.

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:46.473
Eventually, he quit.

00:02:47.553 --> 00:02:49.998
But on the flip side,

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:54.706
what happens when your whole life
is destined for failure

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.228
and you actually succeed?

00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:01.385
I want to urge you
to interview the Scrapper.

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:06.945
I know a lot about this
because I am a Scrapper.

00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.144
Before I was born,

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:13.131
my father was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia,

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:16.870
and he couldn't hold a job
in spite of his brilliance.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.947
Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.037
one part "Awakenings"

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:25.485
and one part "A Beautiful Mind."

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.599
(Laughter)

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:32.434
I'm the fourth of five children
raised by a single mother

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:35.282
in a rough neighborhood
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:40.062
We never owned a home,
a car, a washing machine,

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:44.408
and for most of my childhood,
we didn't even have a telephone.

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:46.461
So I was highly motivated

00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:50.864
to understand the relationship
between business success and Scrappers,

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:55.669
because my life could easily
have turned out very differently.

00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:58.854
As I met successful business people

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:02.200
and read profiles of high-powered leaders,

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:04.075
I noticed some commonality.

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:08.618
Many of them had experienced
early hardships,

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:12.211
anywhere from poverty, abandonment,

00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:14.441
death of a parent while young,

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:18.354
to learning disabilities,
alcoholism and violence.

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:23.171
The conventional thinking has been
that trauma leads to distress,

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:26.634
and there's been a lot of focus
on the resulting dysfunction.

00:04:26.658 --> 00:04:32.135
But during studies of dysfunction,
data revealed an unexpected insight:

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:38.034
that even the worst circumstances
can result in growth and transformation.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:42.247
A remarkable and counterintuitive
phenomenon has been discovered,

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:46.651
which scientists call
Post Traumatic Growth.

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:50.670
In one study designed to measure
the effects of adversity

00:04:50.694 --> 00:04:52.652
on children at risk,

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:57.249
among a subset of 698 children

00:04:57.273 --> 00:05:01.558
who experienced the most severe
and extreme conditions,

00:05:01.582 --> 00:05:08.452
fully one-third grew up to lead healthy,
successful and productive lives.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:13.641
In spite of everything and against
tremendous odds, they succeeded.

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:15.159
One-third.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.625
Take this resume.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.759
This guy's parents
give him up for adoption.

00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:22.855
He never finishes college.

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:25.648
He job-hops quite a bit,

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:28.777
goes on a sojourn to India for a year,

00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:31.912
and to top it off, he has dyslexia.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.241
Would you hire this guy?

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.983
His name is Steve Jobs.

00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:42.402
In a study of the world's
most highly successful entrepreneurs,

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:46.295
it turns out a disproportionate
number have dyslexia.

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:48.189
In the US,

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:52.184
35 percent of the entrepreneurs
studied had dyslexia.

00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.705
What's remarkable --
among those entrepreneurs

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.736
who experience post traumatic growth,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.039
they now view their learning disability

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:07.507
as a desirable difficulty
which provided them an advantage

00:06:07.531 --> 00:06:12.533
because they became better listeners
and paid greater attention to detail.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:18.270
They don't think they are who they are
in spite of adversity,

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:22.633
they know they are who they are
because of adversity.

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:25.382
They embrace their trauma and hardships

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:28.042
as key elements of who they've become,

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:31.343
and know that without those experiences,

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.773
they might not have developed
the muscle and grit required

00:06:34.797 --> 00:06:36.345
to become successful.

00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:41.317
One of my colleagues
had his life completely upended

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:45.743
as a result of the Chinese
Cultural Revolution in 1966.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:51.729
At age 13, his parents were relocated
to the countryside,

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:54.054
the schools were closed

00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:59.304
and he was left alone in Beijing
to fend for himself until 16,

00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:01.658
when he got a job in a clothing factory.

00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:04.265
But instead of accepting his fate,

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.468
he made a resolution that he would
continue his formal education.

00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:13.343
Eleven years later, when
the political landscape changed,

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:17.633
he heard about a highly selective
university admissions test.

00:07:18.383 --> 00:07:22.263
He had three months to learn
the entire curriculum

00:07:22.287 --> 00:07:23.898
of middle and high school.

00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:28.762
So, every day he came home
from the factory,

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:33.475
took a nap, studied until 4am,
went back to work

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.362
and repeated this cycle
every day for three months.

00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:41.016
He did it, he succeeded.

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:46.699
His commitment to his education
was unwavering, and he never lost hope.

00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.217
Today, he holds a master's degree,

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:54.735
and his daughters each have degrees
from Cornell and Harvard.

00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:58.155
Scrappers are propelled by the belief

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:02.660
that the only person you have
full control over is yourself.

00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:05.643
When things don't turn out well,

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:10.683
Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently
to create a better result?"

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.034
Scrappers have a sense of purpose

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:16.164
that prevents them
from giving up on themselves,

00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:22.220
kind of like if you've survived poverty,
a crazy father and several muggings,

00:08:22.244 --> 00:08:24.989
you figure, "Business challenges? --

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:26.045
(Laughter)

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.457
Really?

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:29.657
Piece of cake. I got this."

00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:30.842
(Laughter)

00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:32.661
And that reminds me -- humor.

00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:36.840
Scrappers know that humor
gets you through the tough times,

00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:39.418
and laughter helps you
change your perspective.

00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:42.994
And finally, there are relationships.

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:46.826
People who overcome adversity
don't do it alone.

00:08:47.349 --> 00:08:49.166
Somewhere along the way,

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.626
they find people who
bring out the best in them

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.553
and who are invested in their success.

00:08:56.312 --> 00:08:59.576
Having someone you can
count on no matter what

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.369
is essential to overcoming adversity.

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:04.348
I was lucky.

00:09:04.703 --> 00:09:06.683
In my first job after college,

00:09:06.707 --> 00:09:09.837
I didn't have a car, so I carpooled
across two bridges

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:12.531
with a woman who was
the president's assistant.

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:14.797
She watched me work

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.798
and encouraged me to focus on my future

00:09:17.822 --> 00:09:20.024
and not dwell on my past.

00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:23.637
Along the way I've met many people

00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:27.312
who've provided me
brutally honest feedback,

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:29.332
advice and mentorship.

00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:31.770
These people don't mind

00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:36.037
that I once worked as a singing waitress
to help pay for college.

00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:37.307
(Laughter)

00:09:37.331 --> 00:09:40.520
I'll leave you with one final,
valuable insight.

00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:45.888
Companies that are committed
to diversity and inclusive practices

00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:48.016
tend to support Scrappers

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.849
and outperform their peers.

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:54.103
According to DiversityInc,

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:57.945
a study of their top 50
companies for diversity

00:09:57.969 --> 00:10:02.626
outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.348
So back to my original question.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.425
Who are you going to bet on:

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:12.873
Silver Spoon or Scrapper?

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.515
I say choose the underestimated contender,

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:21.398
whose secret weapons
are passion and purpose.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.389
Hire the Scrapper.

00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:27.565
(Applause)
