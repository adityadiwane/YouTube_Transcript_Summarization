00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The debate is over the proposition:

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
"What the world needs now

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
is nuclear energy." True or false?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And before we have the debate,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I'd like to actually take a show of hands --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
on balance, right now, are you for or against this?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Okay, hands down.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Those who are against, raise your hands.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Okay, I'm reading that at about

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
75 to 25 in favor at the start.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and see how that shifts, if at all.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and then after one little, quick exchange between them,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to have 30 seconds

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is one of, truly, the founders of the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
environmental movement,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Stewart Brand: Whoa.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
(Applause)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
The saying is that with climate, those who know the most

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
are the most worried.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
With nuclear, those who know the most

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
are the least worried.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
A classic example is James Hansen,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
a NASA climatologist

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
pushing for 350 parts per million

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
He came out with a wonderful book recently

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
called "Storms of My Grandchildren."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
as are most climatologists

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
who are engaging this issue seriously.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
This is the design situation:

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
a planet that is facing climate change

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and is now half urban.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Look at the client base for this.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Five out of six of us

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
live in the developing world.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
And we are educating our kids,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
having fewer kids,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
basically good news all around.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is electricity.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This is one of the most desired things

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
by poor people all over the world,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
in the cities and in the countryside.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Electricity for cities, at its best,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
is what's called baseload electricity.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
That's where it is on

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
all the time.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And so far there are only three major sources of that --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
coal and gas, hydro-electric,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
which in most places is maxed-out --

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and nuclear.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I would love to have something in the fourth place here,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
but in terms of constant, clean,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
scalable energy,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
[solar] and wind and the other renewables

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
aren't there yet because they're inconstant.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Now, from an environmental standpoint,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
the main thing you want to look at

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
the two major sources of electricity.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
the waste from that lifetime of electricity

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
would go in a Coke can --

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
But one day of coal

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
adds up to one hell of a lot

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
of carbon dioxide

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Then what happens to the waste?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
The nuclear waste typically goes into

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
a dry cask storage

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
out back of the parking lot at the reactor site

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
because most places don't have underground storage yet.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
While the carbon dioxide,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
vast quantities of it, gigatons,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
goes into the atmosphere

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
where we can't get it back -- yet --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
So when you add up the greenhouse gases

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in the lifetime of these various energy sources,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Wind is wonderful; I love wind.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
I love being around these

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
big wind generators.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
But one of the things we're discovering is that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
wind, like solar, is an actually relatively

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
dilute source of energy.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
a very large footprint in terms of materials,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
is on the order of 250 square miles

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
of wind farm.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
In places like Denmark and Germany,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
they've maxed out on wind already.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
They've run out of good sites.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
The power lines are getting overloaded.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And you peak out.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Likewise, with solar,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
especially here in California,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
we're discovering that the 80 solar farm

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
schemes that are going forward

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
want to basically bulldoze

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
1,000 square miles of southern California desert.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Solar's wonderful on rooftops.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But out in the landscape,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
of bulldozed desert.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
When you add all these things up --

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
what would it take

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to get 13 clean

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
terawatts of energy

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
from wind, solar and biofuels,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and that area would be roughly the size of the United States,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
an area he refers to as "Renewistan."

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a physicist in England,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
(Laughter)

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
In terms of weapons,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
We have been taking down

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
the Russian warheads,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
turning it into electricity.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Ten percent of American electricity

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
comes from decommissioned warheads.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
We haven't even started the American stockpile.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
I think of most interest to a TED audience

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
would be the new generation of reactors

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
that are very small,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
down around 10

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to 125 megawatts.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
This is one from Toshiba.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Typically, these things are put in the ground.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
They're incredibly safe,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
called the Hyperion,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and another one from Oregon called NuScale.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Babcock &amp; Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
here's an integral fast reactor.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
The governments of the world are going to have to decide

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And here's the future.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
(Applause)

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
CA: Okay. Okay.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Applause)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
So arguing against,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
In 2000, he discovered that soot

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
His team have been making detailed calculations

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
of the relative impacts

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
of different energy sources.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
from Stanford,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
(Applause)

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So my premise here is that nuclear energy

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
puts out more carbon dioxide,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
puts out more air pollutants,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
than real renewable energy systems,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
namely wind, solar,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
So let's start just by looking at the

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
of all the greenhouse gases and particles

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that cause warming

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and converted to CO2.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
estimate of nuclear.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
The high is the average of 103

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
scientific, peer-reviewed studies.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And this is just the

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
CO2 from the life cycle.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
If we look at the delays,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
it takes between 10 and 19 years

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
to put up a nuclear power plant

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
from planning to operation.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
This includes about three and a half to six years

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
for a site permit.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and another two and a half to four years

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
for a construction permit and issue,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and then four to nine years for actual construction.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
And in China, right now,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And the average, just for the construction time of these,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
is 7.1 years

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
on top of any planning times.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
you have to run the regular electric power grid,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And the chart here shows the difference between

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
the emissions from the regular grid,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Wind takes about two to five years on average,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
So the difference is the opportunity cost

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So if you add these two together, alone,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
you can see a separation

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And this doesn't even account

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
for the footprint on the ground.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
If you look at the air pollution health effects,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
this is the number of deaths per year in 2020

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
just from vehicle exhaust.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Well, right now in the United States,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
due to improvements.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
the death rates of 2020.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
If you go to nuclear,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
you do get a big reduction,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Now if you consider the fact

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
that nuclear weapons proliferation

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
because we know for example,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
by enriching uranium

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
in nuclear energy facilities.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
North Korea did that to some extent.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Iran is doing that right now.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And Venezuela would be doing it

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
If you do a large scale expansion

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
of nuclear energy across the world,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and as a result there was just one

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
nuclear bomb created

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
that was used to destroy a city

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
the additional death rates due to this

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
would be this.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So, do we need this?

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
That, because the footprint, as you can see,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
is just the pole touching the ground.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
with 73,000 to 145,000

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
five-megawatt wind turbines.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
That would take between one and three square kilometers

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
of footprint on the ground, entirely.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
The spacing is something else.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
That's the footprint that is always being confused.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
People confuse footprint with spacing.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
As you can see from these pictures,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
including agricultural land,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
range land or open space.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Over the ocean, it's not even land.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
With nuclear, what do we have?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
that's 17 square kilometers.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And you have the uranium mining

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
that you have to deal with.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Now if we go to the area,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
lots is worse than nuclear or wind.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
this is how much land you would need.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
That's cellulosic, second generation

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
biofuels from prairie grass.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
This is based on ranges from data,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
but if you look at nuclear,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
For wind, there's a larger area,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
but much smaller footprint.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And of course, with wind,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
you could put it all over the East Coast,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And now, if you go back to

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
but it's still pretty small.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
you would need about one percent of world land.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Matching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
You can do that by combining renewables.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
This is from real data in California,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
looking at wind data and solar data.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And it considers just using existing hydro

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
to match the hour-by-hour power demand.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Here are the world wind resources.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
than we need for all the world.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So then here's the final ranking.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
You can either have wind or nuclear.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
If you use wind,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
you guarantee ice will last.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Nuclear, the time lag alone

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
or an uncertain future with nuclear power.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:10.260
(Applause)

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
CA: All right.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So while they're having their comebacks on each other --

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
I need two people from either side.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
So if you're for this,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
If you're against, put up one.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And I want two of each for the mics.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Now then, you guys have --

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
you have a minute comeback on him

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
to pick up a point he said, challenge it,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
whatever.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
has to do with weapons

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
and energy.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
which is kind of finessing it

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
a little bit, I think.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
The reality is that there's, what,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
21 nations that have nuclear power?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
In every case, they got the weapons

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
before they got the nuclear power.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that have nuclear weapons

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and don't have nuclear power at all.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
The places that we would most like to have

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
really clean energy occur

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
are China, India, Europe, North America,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
all of which have sorted out their situation

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
in relation to nuclear weapons.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
maybe Venezuela,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
that you would like to have very close

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
surveillance of anything

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
that goes on with fissile stuff.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
really know where all of the fissile material is,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
and we can move toward

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
zero weapons left, once we know all that.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
CA: Mark,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
There's plenty of solar and wind.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
That's from real data.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Solving the world's problems can be done,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
(Applause)

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
CA: We need someone for.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
I've been involved in global warming policy

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
since 1994,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
I've come around in the last 10 years.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
I used to be against nuclear power.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
I'm now supporting Stewart's position,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
softly, from a risk-management standpoint,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
agreeing that

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
the risks of overheating the planet

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
outweigh the risk of nuclear incident,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
which certainly is possible and is a very real problem.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
However, I think there may be a win-win solution here

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
where both parties can win this debate,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and that is, we face a situation

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
where it's carbon caps on this planet

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
or die.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
And in the United States Senate,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
we need bipartisan support --

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
only one or two votes are needed --

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
to move global warming through the Senate,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
and this room can help.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
CA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
David Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
The first is: be aware of the propaganda.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
The propaganda from the industry

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
has been very, very strong.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
And we have not had

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
the other side of the argument fully aired

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
so that people can draw their own conclusions.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
Be very aware of the propaganda.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
Secondly, think about this.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
If we build all these nuclear power plants,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
all that waste

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
of trucks and trains,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
moving through this country every day.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
Tell me that those accidents aren't going to

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
put material into the environment

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.260
And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
isn't a potential terrorist target.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
CA: Thank you.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
For.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260
Anyone else for? Go.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
I've got solar PV on my roof.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
I've got a hydro conversion

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
at a watermill that I own.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
The capability of

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
the sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
simply isn't enough to add up.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
So if we want to keep the lights on,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
we actually need a solution

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
which is going to keep generating all of the time.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
and I continue to do so now.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
But we've got an opportunity

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
to recycle them into something more useful

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
that enables us to get energy all of the time.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
We need a solution that generates all of the time.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
If we're going to keep the lights on,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
nuclear is that solution.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
CA: Thank you.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
Anyone else against?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
Man: The last person who was in favor made the premise

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
that we don't have enough

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.260
alternative renewable resources.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.260
And our "against" proponent up here

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
made it very clear that we actually do.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
And so the fallacy

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
that we need this resource

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
and we can actually make it in a time frame

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
that is meaningful is not possible.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
I will also add one other thing.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.260
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks --

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.260
we know that the stick is going up exponentially.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.260
So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.260
and say, "That's all we have."

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
Because five years from now, it will blow you away

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
what we'll actually have as alternatives

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.260
CA: Point well made. Thank you.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260
(Applause)

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
So each of you has really just a couple sentences --

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.260
30 seconds each

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.260
to sum up.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
Your final pitch, Stewart.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.260
SB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.260
that you had there.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.260
It was a sunny day and a windy night.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
And just now in England

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
they had a cold spell.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
All of the wind in the entire country

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.260
shut down for a week.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.260
None of those things were stirring.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.260
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
This keeps happening.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.260
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.260
And the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.260
in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.260
And especially the small reactors need to go forward.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point --

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.260
it'll take an act of Congress

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.260
to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.260
start moving quickly on these small reactors,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.260
which we need very much, here and in the world.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:04.260
(Applause)

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
MJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.260
power demand and supply,

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.260
looking at solar, wind, using data for California.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.260
And you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.260
for the whole year almost.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.260
Now, with regard to the resources,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260
we've developed the first wind map of the world,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.260
from data alone, at 80 meters.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.260
We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.260
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.260
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.260
And there's much more solar than there is wind.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.260
There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.260
CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.260
(Applause)

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.260
So if you were in Palm Springs ...

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.260
(Laughter)

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.260
(Applause)

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.260
Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
(Applause)

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.260
So, people of the TED community,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.260
I put it to you that what the world needs now

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.260
is nuclear energy.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.260
All those in favor, raise your hands.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.260
(Shouts)

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.260
And all those against.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.260
Ooooh.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.260
Now that is -- my take on that ...

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.260
Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.260
who voted differently.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.260
Those of you who changed your mind

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.260
in favor of "for"

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.260
put your hands up.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.260
Okay. So here's the read on it.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.260
Both people won supporters,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.260
but on my count,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.260
the mood of the TED community shifted

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.260
from about 75 to 25

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.260
to about 65 to 35

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.260
in favor, in favor.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.260
You both won. I congratulate both of you.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.260
Thank you for that.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.260
(Applause)
