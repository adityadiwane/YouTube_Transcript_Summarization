00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.260
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.260
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement:

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
please switch off your

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
proper English check programs

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
installed in your brain.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
(Applause)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
It receives the least rainfall in the country,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
lowest rainfall.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
centimeters, 16 [centimeters].

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
though there is no electricity in most of the villages.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.260
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps --

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
they are of no use in this area.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Clouds seldom visit this area.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:34.260
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This is a new work, it's a new program.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But for the desert society

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.260
this is no program; this is their life.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And they harvest rain in many ways.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So, this is the first device they use

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
in harvesting rain.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And you can notice they have created

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
a kind of false catchment.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And this is all big raised platform.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
You can notice the small holes

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
the water will fall on this catchment,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and there is a slope.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Sometimes our engineers and architects

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
do not care about slopes in bathrooms,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
but here they will care properly.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And the water will go where it should go.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And then it is 40 feet deep.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The waterproofing is done perfectly,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
better than our city contractors,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.260
because not a single drop should go waste in this.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And this is pure drinking water.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Below the surface there is hard saline water.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.260
But now you can have this for year round.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
It's two houses.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
We often use a term called bylaws.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Because we are used to get written things.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
But here it is unwritten by law.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And people made their house,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and the water storage tanks.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
These raised up platforms just like this stage.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
In fact they go 15 feet deep,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and collect rain water from roof,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.260
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Another big one,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.260
this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.260
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
The age is 400 years.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So, since 400 years it has been giving you

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.260
almost six million gallons of water per season.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
You can calculate the price of that water.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.260
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
It can break sometimes.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
it is maintained for so many generations.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
But they can be opened for TED people.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.260
(Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And we request them.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
You can see person coming up with

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
two canisters of water.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
water level is right up to this.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It can envy many municipalities,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.260
the color, the taste, the purity of this water.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And this is what they call Zero B type of water,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
because it comes from the clouds,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
pure distilled water.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
We stop for a quick commercial break,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and then we come back to the traditional systems.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
The government thought that this is a very

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
backward area and we should bring

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
a multi-million dollar project

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
to bring water from the Himalayas.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.260
(Laughter)

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But we will come back, once again,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to the traditional thing.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.260
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
soon it become like this.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
In many portions, water hyacinth

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.260
covered these big canals like anything.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
you will notice in Bikaner things like this:

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
where the water hyacinth couldn't grow,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.260
the sand is flowing in these canals.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
(Laughter)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
We had full-page advertisements,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.260
They said that throw away your traditional systems,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.260
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And people started renovating their own structures.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
These are all traditional water structures,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.260
(Laughter)

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And they are plaiting hair.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
(Applause)

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This town was established 800 years ago.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I'm not sure by that time

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
None of us were able to go to Europe,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And this is the 16 centimeter area.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Such a limited rainfall,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
You won't find water in this slide.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
But it is invisible.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.260
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
is running through here.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
because every roof which you see in this picture

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
collects rainwater drops

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and deposit in the rooms.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
But apart from this system,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.260
they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And what we call private public partnership

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
you can add estate also.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.260
work together to build this beautiful water body.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Whether water level goes up or down,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
the beauty is there throughout.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Another water body, dried up, of course,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
during the summer period,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.260
but you can see how the traditional society

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.260
combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
These statues, marvelous statues,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
gives you an idea of water table.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.260
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
it will submerge these beautiful statues

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
in what we call in English today "mass communication."

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
This was for mass communication.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
so water will be there for seven months or nine months,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
or 12 months.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
And then they will come and worship this pond,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
pay respect, their gratitude.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Another small water body, called the [unclear].

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
It is difficult to translate in English,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
especially in my English.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.260
The reputation in desert of this small water body is

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
that it never dries up.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
In severe drought periods

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
nobody has seen this water body

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
getting dried up.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And perhaps they knew the future also.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
It was designed some 150 years ago.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.260
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.260
there will be a TED green and blue session,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
so they painted it like this.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.260
(Laughter)

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.260
(Applause)

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Dry water body. Children are standing on

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
a very difficult device to explain.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.260
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
But this is not ground water.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
You can draw ground water from any well.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
But this is no ordinary well.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.260
It squeeze the moisture

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
hidden in the sand.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.260
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
some three million years ago.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And where we have this gypsum strip

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
they can harvest this water.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
This is the same dry water body.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
Now, you don't find any kund;

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
they are all submerged.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
But when the water goes down they will be able

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
to draw water from those structures throughout the year.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.260
This year they have received only six centimeters.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
Six centimeter of rainfall,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and they can telephone you

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
that if you find any water problem in your city,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.260
(Laughter)

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
How they maintain them?

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
There are three things: concept, planning,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
It is a structure for maintain,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.260
for centuries, by generations, without any department,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
without any funding,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.260
So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Your own thing, not personal property,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
my property, every time.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
So, these stone pillars

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260
will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
so that the clean water can be collected.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
If you climb these three, six steps

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
you will find something very nice.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
This was done in 11th century.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And you have to go further down.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
so we can say a thousand words right now,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
an another thousand words.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
If the water table goes down,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
you will find new stairs.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.260
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So, throughout the year

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.260
this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
there is a four-story building

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.260
where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:23.260
(Applause)

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Excuse me, who built these structures?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
They are in front of you.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.260
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
the best architects.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
We can say that because of them,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
because of their forefathers,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
India could get the first engineering college

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in 1847.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
There were no English medium schools at that time,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
But such people, compelled to the East India Company,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
(Laughter)

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
but not to create the engineering colleges.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.260
But because of them, first engineering college was created

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
in a small village, not in the town.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.260
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
that camel is a ship of desert.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
So, you can find through your Jeep,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
a camel, and a cart.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.260
This tire comes from the airplane.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
So, look at the beauty from the desert society

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
who can harvest rainwater,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and also create something

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.260
through a tire from a jet plane,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
and used in a camel cart.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Last picture, it's a tattoo,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
2,000-years-old tattoo.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
They were using it on their body.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Tattoo was, at one time,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
a kind of a blacklisted

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
or con thing, but now it is in thing.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
(Laughter)

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
(Applause)

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
(Laughter)

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.260
The center of life is water.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
These are the beautiful waves.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
These are the beautiful stairs

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
which we just saw in one of the slides.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
These are the trees.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And these are the flowers which

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.260
add fragrance to our lives.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So, this is the message of desert.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:16:00.260
(Applause)

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:11.260
(Applause)

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.260
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
that the world can learn from this?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
Or is this just right for this place?

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
utilize water that falls on our area.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.260
right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
And these [unclear], which stored water,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
there are two type of things.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
One recharge, and one stores.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.260
So, it depends on the terrain.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.260
for that you have to go back to your calendar,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
three million years ago.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
If it is there it can be done right now.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Otherwise, it can't be done.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.260
(Laughter)

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
(Applause)

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
CA: Thank you so much.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Applause)
