00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:15.940
So, this happy pic of me
was taken in 1999.

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:18.054
I was a senior in college,

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:20.010
and it was right after a dance practice.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:21.552
I was really, really happy.

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:26.034
And I remember exactly where I was
about a week and a half later.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.277
I was sitting in the back
of my used minivan

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.064
in a campus parking lot,

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:32.239
when I decided

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:34.042
I was going to commit suicide.

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:39.833
I went from deciding
to full-blown planning very quickly.

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:43.383
And I came this close
to the edge of the precipice.

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:45.044
It's the closest I've ever come.

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:48.481
And the only reason I took
my finger off the trigger

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.928
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.190
And after the fact,

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:56.336
that's what scared me the most:
the element of chance.

00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:00.254
So I became very methodical
about testing different ways

00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:02.408
that I could manage my ups and downs,

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:06.301
which has proven to be
a good investment. (Laughs)

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:10.477
Many normal people might have,
say, six to 10 major depressive episodes

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.028
in their lives.

00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:14.378
I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.427
I've had 50-plus at this point,

00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.972
and I've learned a lot.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:21.568
I've had a lot of at-bats,

00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:23.933
many rounds in the ring with darkness,

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:25.417
taking good notes.

00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:29.116
So I thought rather than get up
and give any type of recipe for success

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.293
or highlight reel,

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:34.156
I would share my recipe
for avoiding self-destruction,

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.058
and certainly self-paralysis.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.035
And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:43.495
for emotional free fall

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.072
is actually the same tool

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:48.697
that has helped me to make
my best business decisions.

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.041
But that is secondary.

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:53.670
And it is ... stoicism.

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:55.218
That sounds boring.

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:56.305
(Laughter)

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.945
You might think of Spock,

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.484
or it might conjure and image like this --

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:01.984
(Laughter)

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:03.985
a cow standing in the rain.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.330
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:11.154
It's just an impassive creature taking
whatever life sends its way.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.115
You might not think of the ultimate
competitor, say, Bill Belichick,

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.395
head coach of the New England Patriots,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.468
who has the all-time NFL record
for Super Bowl titles.

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:26.847
And stoicism has spread like wildfire
in the top of the NFL ranks

00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:30.028
as a means of mental toughness
training in the last few years.

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.261
You might not think
of the Founding Fathers --

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:37.423
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
George Washington

00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:40.239
to name but three students of stoicism.

00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:44.361
George Washington actually had
a play about a Stoic --

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:46.368
this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --

00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:49.579
performed for his troops at Valley Forge
to keep them motivated.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:54.246
So why would people of action
focus so much on an ancient philosophy?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.956
This seems very academic.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:00.028
I would encourage you to think
about stoicism a little bit differently,

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:03.315
as an operating system for thriving
in high-stress environments,

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.821
for making better decisions.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.969
And it all started here,

00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:09.156
kind of,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.626
on a porch.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.907
So around 300 BC in Athens,

00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.804
someone named Zeno of Citium
taught many lectures

00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:19.580
walking around a painted porch, a "stoa."

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:21.336
That later became "stoicism."

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.617
And in the Greco-Roman world,

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.403
people used stoicism
as a comprehensive system

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:28.837
for doing many, many things.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.549
But for our purposes, chief among them
was training yourself

00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:37.020
to separate what you can control
from what you cannot control,

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:40.102
and then doing exercises
to focus exclusively

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:41.277
on the former.

00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:43.679
This decreases emotional reactivity,

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:45.251
which can be a superpower.

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.844
Conversely, let's say
you're a quarterback.

00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:51.060
You miss a pass.
You get furious with yourself.

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:52.590
That could cost you a game.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:57.008
If you're a CEO, and you fly
off the handle at a very valued employee

00:03:57.032 --> 00:03:58.532
because of a minor infraction,

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:00.567
that could cost you the employee.

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:06.099
If you're a college student
who, say, is in a downward spiral,

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:08.913
and you feel helpless and hopeless,

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:10.914
unabated, that could cost you your life.

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.197
So the stakes are very, very high.

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:17.215
And there are many tools
in the toolkit to get you there.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.076
I'm going to focus on one
that completely changed my life in 2004.

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:24.439
It found me then because of two things:

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:29.828
a very close friend, young guy, my age,
died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:33.680
and then my girlfriend, who I thought
I was going to marry, walked out.

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:37.749
She'd had enough, and she didn't
give me a Dear John letter,

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.124
but she did give me this,

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:41.460
a Dear John plaque.

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:42.532
(Laughter)

00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:44.341
I'm not making this up. I've kept it.

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:47.002
"Business hours are over at five o'clock."

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.792
She gave this to me
to put on my desk for personal health,

00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:53.085
because at the time, I was working
on my first real business.

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:56.228
I had no idea what I was doing.
I was working 14-plus hour days,

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:57.685
seven days a week.

00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.412
I was using stimulants to get going.

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:03.017
I was using depressants
to wind down and go to sleep.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.232
It was a disaster.

00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:05.760
I felt completely trapped.

00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:10.532
I bought a book on simplicity
to try to find answers.

00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:14.385
And I did find a quote
that made a big difference in my life,

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.556
which was, "We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,"

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.364
by Seneca the Younger,

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.011
who was a famous Stoic writer.

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:24.851
That took me to his letters,

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.328
which took me to the exercise,

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.855
"premeditatio malorum,"

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.175
which means the pre-meditation of evils.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.355
In simple terms,

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.498
this is visualizing the worst-case
scenarios, in detail, that you fear,

00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:40.239
preventing you from taking action,

00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:43.003
so that you can take action
to overcome that paralysis.

00:05:43.027 --> 00:05:46.916
My problem was monkey mind --
super loud, very incessant.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.529
Just thinking my way
through problems doesn't work.

00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:51.578
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:53.569
So I created a written exercise

00:05:53.593 --> 00:05:55.975
that I called "fear-setting,"
like goal-setting,

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.168
for myself.

00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:59.291
It consists of three pages.

00:05:59.728 --> 00:06:00.989
Super simple.

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.617
The first page is right here.

00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:05.817
"What if I ...?"

00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:07.398
This is whatever you fear,

00:06:07.422 --> 00:06:09.505
whatever is causing you anxiety,

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:10.890
whatever you're putting off.

00:06:10.914 --> 00:06:12.401
It could be asking someone out,

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:14.049
ending a relationship,

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:17.111
asking for a promotion,
quitting a job, starting a company.

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:18.292
It could be anything.

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:21.348
For me, it was taking
my first vacation in four years

00:06:21.372 --> 00:06:24.379
and stepping away from my business
for a month to go to London,

00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:27.447
where I could stay
in a friend's room for free,

00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.177
to either remove myself
as a bottleneck in the business

00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.446
or shut it down.

00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:34.303
In the first column, "Define,"

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.831
you're writing down all of the worst
things you can imagine happening

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:39.406
if you take that step.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.992
You want 10 to 20.

00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:44.036
I won't go through all of them,
but I'll give you two examples.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.776
One was, I'll go to London,
it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.023
the whole thing will be
a huge waste of time.

00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:52.851
Number two, I'll miss
a letter from the IRS,

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.390
and I'll get audited

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.952
or raided or shut down or some such.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:06:59.379
And then you go to the "Prevent" column.

00:06:59.403 --> 00:07:01.553
In that column, you write
down the answer to:

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:04.672
What could I do to prevent
each of these bullets from happening,

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:08.170
or, at the very least, decrease
the likelihood even a little bit?

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.044
So for getting depressed in London,

00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:13.082
I could take a portable blue light with me

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:15.101
and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.780
I knew that helped stave off
depressive episodes.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:21.675
For the IRS bit, I could change
the mailing address on file with the IRS

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.766
so the paperwork would go to my accountant

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.743
instead of to my UPS address.

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:27.216
Easy-peasy.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.282
Then we go to "Repair."

00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:32.528
So if the worst-case scenarios happen,

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.518
what could you do to repair
the damage even a little bit,

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:37.308
or who could you ask for help?

00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:39.740
So in the first case, London,

00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:43.439
well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun --

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.110
undo the damage, if I got into a funk.

00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:48.543
In the case of missing
a letter from the IRS,

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:51.008
I could call a friend who is a lawyer

00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:53.526
or ask, say, a professor of law

00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:55.898
what they would recommend,

00:07:55.922 --> 00:07:59.118
who I should talk to,
how had people handled this in the past.

00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:03.179
So one question to keep in mind
as you're doing this first page is:

00:08:03.203 --> 00:08:05.360
Has anyone else in the history of time

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.491
less intelligent or less driven

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:08.739
figured this out?

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:11.499
Chances are, the answer is "Yes."

00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:12.525
(Laughter)

00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:15.626
The second page is simple:

00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:19.494
What might be the benefits
of an attempt or a partial success?

00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:21.329
You can see we're playing up the fears

00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:24.235
and really taking a conservative
look at the upside.

00:08:24.744 --> 00:08:27.110
So if you attempted whatever
you're considering,

00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:29.318
might you build confidence,
develop skills,

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.124
emotionally, financially, otherwise?

00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:34.887
What might be the benefits
of, say, a base hit?

00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:36.978
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.

00:08:37.002 --> 00:08:38.548
Page three.

00:08:38.572 --> 00:08:40.984
This might be the most important,
so don't skip it:

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:42.558
"The Cost of Inaction."

00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:45.490
Humans are very good at considering
what might go wrong

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:48.903
if we try something new,
say, ask for a raise.

00:08:48.927 --> 00:08:54.525
What we don't often consider
is the atrocious cost of the status quo --

00:08:54.549 --> 00:08:55.983
not changing anything.

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:58.630
So you should ask yourself,

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:01.854
if I avoid this action or decision

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:05.385
and actions and decisions like it,

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:10.166
what might my life look like in,
say, six months, 12 months, three years?

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.678
Any further out, it starts
to seem intangible.

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:16.549
And really get detailed --
again, emotionally, financially,

00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:17.771
physically, whatever.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.094
And when I did this, it painted
a terrifying picture.

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:22.654
I was self-medicating,

00:09:23.237 --> 00:09:26.998
my business was going to implode
at any moment at all times,

00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:28.187
if I didn't step away.

00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:30.744
My relationships were fraying or failing.

00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:34.869
And I realized that inaction
was no longer an option for me.

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.742
Those are the three pages. That's it.
That's fear-setting.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:42.357
And after this, I realized
that on a scale of one to 10,

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.948
one being minimal impact,
10 being maximal impact,

00:09:45.972 --> 00:09:47.614
if I took the trip, I was risking

00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:50.972
a one to three of temporary
and reversible pain

00:09:50.996 --> 00:09:55.007
for an eight to 10 of positive,
life-changing impact

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:56.633
that could be a semi-permanent.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:58.983
So I took the trip.

00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:00.782
None of the disasters came to pass.

00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:02.301
There were some hiccups, sure.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:04.867
I was able to extricate myself
from the business.

00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.749
I ended up extending that trip
for a year and a half around the world,

00:10:08.773 --> 00:10:10.979
and that became the basis
for my first book,

00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:12.480
that leads me here today.

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:15.836
And I can trace all of my biggest wins

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.763
and all of my biggest disasters averted

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:20.669
back to doing fear-setting

00:10:20.693 --> 00:10:22.264
at least once a quarter.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.229
It's not a panacea.

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:27.143
You'll find that some of your fears
are very well-founded.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:28.222
(Laughter)

00:10:28.246 --> 00:10:29.897
But you shouldn't conclude that

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.468
without first putting them
under a microscope.

00:10:33.144 --> 00:10:36.353
And it doesn't make all the hard times,
the hard choices, easy,

00:10:36.377 --> 00:10:38.328
but it can make a lot of them easier.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:43.394
I'd like to close with a profile
of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.

00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:45.883
This is Jerzy Gregorek.

00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:50.051
He is a four-time world champion
in Olympic weightlifting,

00:10:50.075 --> 00:10:51.449
political refugee,

00:10:51.473 --> 00:10:52.754
published poet,

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:54.755
62 years old.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.249
He can still kick my ass and probably
most asses in this room.

00:10:59.257 --> 00:11:00.459
He's an impressive guy.

00:11:00.483 --> 00:11:02.747
I spent a lot of time
on his stoa, his porch,

00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:04.775
asking life and training advice.

00:11:05.988 --> 00:11:09.172
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,

00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:11.862
which was a nonviolent
movement for social change

00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.663
that was violently suppressed
by the government.

00:11:14.687 --> 00:11:16.733
He lost his career as a firefighter.

00:11:16.757 --> 00:11:19.878
Then his mentor, a priest,
was kidnapped, tortured, killed

00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:21.536
and thrown into a river.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.774
He was then threatened.

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:25.956
He and his wife had to flee Poland,
bounce from country to country

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.434
until they landed in the US
with next to nothing,

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:29.851
sleeping on floors.

00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:34.282
He now lives in Woodside, California,
in a very nice place,

00:11:34.306 --> 00:11:36.931
and of the 10,000-plus people
I've met in my life,

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:39.239
I would put him in the top 10,

00:11:39.263 --> 00:11:41.457
in terms of success and happiness.

00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:44.718
And there's a punchline coming,
so pay attention.

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.605
I sent him a text a few weeks ago,

00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:49.424
asking him: Had he ever read
any Stoic philosophy?

00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:51.846
And he replied with two pages of text.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.115
This is very unlike him.
He is a terse dude.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.631
(Laughter)

00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:58.716
And not only was he familiar
with stoicism,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.134
but he pointed out, for all
of his most important decisions,

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:03.665
his inflection points,

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:07.275
when he stood up
for his principles and ethics,

00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:11.064
how he had used stoicism
and something akin to fear-setting,

00:12:11.088 --> 00:12:12.250
which blew my mind.

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:13.921
And he closed with two things.

00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:17.672
Number one: he couldn't imagine
any life more beautiful

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.155
than that of a Stoic.

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:23.561
And the last was his mantra,
which he applies to everything,

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.709
and you can apply to everything:

00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:29.233
"Easy choices, hard life.

00:12:29.877 --> 00:12:32.386
Hard choices, easy life."

00:12:34.092 --> 00:12:36.069
The hard choices --

00:12:36.093 --> 00:12:39.902
what we most fear doing, asking, saying --

00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.391
these are very often exactly
what we most need to do.

00:12:45.788 --> 00:12:48.277
And the biggest challenges
and problems we face

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:51.396
will never be solved
with comfortable conversations,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.126
whether it's in your own head
or with other people.

00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:56.989
So I encourage you to ask yourselves:

00:12:57.013 --> 00:12:58.928
Where in your lives right now

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:03.746
might defining your fears be more
important than defining your goals?

00:13:04.786 --> 00:13:07.991
Keeping in mind all the while,
the words of Seneca:

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:11.964
"We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality."

00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:13.160
Thank you very much.

00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:20.042
(Applause)
