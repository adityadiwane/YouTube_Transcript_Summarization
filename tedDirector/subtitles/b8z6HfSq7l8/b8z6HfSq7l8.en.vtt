00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.523
So last year, on the Fourth of July,

00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:18.022
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:20.312
discovered the Higgs boson.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:22.280
It was a historical day.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.575
There's no doubt that from now on,

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.409
the Fourth of July will be remembered

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.851
not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:32.685
but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.117
Well, at least, here at CERN.

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:39.272
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.771
was that there was no big surprise.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:44.370
In the eye of a theoretical physicist,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.263
the Higgs boson is a clever explanation

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:49.786
of how some elementary particles gain mass,

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:52.622
but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:54.828
and incomplete solution.

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:57.852
Too many questions are left unanswered.

00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:00.687
The Higgs boson does not share the beauty,

00:01:00.687 --> 00:01:02.572
the symmetry, the elegance,

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:05.300
of the rest of the elementary particle world.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.922
For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:11.864
believe that the Higgs boson could not

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:14.346
be the full story.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:17.200
We were expecting new particles and new phenomena

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.650
accompanying the Higgs boson.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.968
Instead, so far, the measurements

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:25.726
coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:27.875
or unexpected phenomena.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.528
Of course, the verdict is not definitive.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.522
In 2015, the LHC will almost double

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:38.213
the energy of the colliding protons,

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:40.284
and these more powerful collisions

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:44.868
will allow us to explore further the particle world,

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:48.000
and we will certainly learn much more.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.146
But for the moment, since we have found

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:54.295
no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:57.459
that the particles that we know today,

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.315
including the Higgs boson,

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:02.600
are the only elementary particles in nature,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.344
even at energies much larger

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:08.110
than what we have explored so far.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.742
Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:16.174
We will find a surprising and intriguing result

00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:19.973
about our universe, and to explain my point,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:23.849
let me first tell you what the Higgs is about,

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.983
and to do so, we have to go back

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:31.340
to one tenth of a billionth of a second

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.871
after the Big Bang.

00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.912
And according to the Higgs theory,

00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:38.278
at that instant, a dramatic event took place

00:02:38.278 --> 00:02:39.869
in the universe.

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.660
Space-time underwent a phase transition.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.737
It was something very similar to the phase transition

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:51.282
that occurs when water turns into ice

00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:53.243
below zero degrees.

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:56.183
But in our case, the phase transition

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:58.714
is not a change in the way the molecules

00:02:58.714 --> 00:03:01.000
are arranged inside the material,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.888
but is about a change

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:06.514
of the very fabric of space-time.

00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:09.140
During this phase transition, empty space

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.812
became filled with a substance

00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:14.844
that we now call Higgs field.

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:17.173
And this substance may seem invisible to us,

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:19.851
but it has a physical reality.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.909
It surrounds us all the time,

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.610
just like the air we breathe in this room.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.928
And some elementary particles interact

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:31.756
with this substance, gaining energy in the process.

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.831
And this intrinsic energy is what we call

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:36.964
the mass of a particle,

00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:40.217
and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:44.749
has conclusively proved that this substance is real,

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.668
because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.

00:03:48.668 --> 00:03:52.112
And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.

00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:56.855
But this story is far more interesting than that.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:59.166
By studying the Higgs theory,

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:01.526
theoretical physicists discovered,

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:03.430
not through an experiment

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.906
but with the power of mathematics,

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:09.618
that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist

00:04:09.618 --> 00:04:12.955
only in the form that we observe today.

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:18.000
Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.572
so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:25.926
could exist in two states.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:28.236
Besides the known Higgs state,

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:31.383
there could be a second state in which the Higgs field

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:34.919
is billions and billions times denser

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.964
than what we observe today,

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:40.451
and the mere existence of another state

00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.696
of the Higgs field poses a potential problem.

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:47.934
This is because, according to the laws

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.627
of quantum mechanics, it is possible

00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:53.459
to have transitions between two states,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.408
even in the presence of an energy barrier

00:04:56.408 --> 00:04:59.036
separating the two states,

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:01.245
and the phenomenon is called,

00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:05.387
quite appropriately, quantum tunneling.

00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:07.278
Because of quantum tunneling,

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.811
I could disappear from this room

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.133
and reappear in the next room,

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:16.528
practically penetrating the wall.

00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:19.343
But don't expect me to actually perform the trick

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:21.921
in front of your eyes, because the probability

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:26.309
for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:28.907
You would have to wait a really long time

00:05:28.907 --> 00:05:31.039
before it happens, but believe me,

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.216
quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:37.411
and it has been observed in many systems.

00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:39.973
For instance, the tunnel diode,

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.170
a component used in electronics,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.592
works thanks to the wonders

00:05:44.592 --> 00:05:46.912
of quantum tunneling.

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.204
But let's go back to the Higgs field.

00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:53.767
If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.121
then, because of quantum tunneling,

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:59.834
a bubble of this state could suddenly appear

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:03.076
in a certain place of the universe at a certain time,

00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:06.841
and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.

00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:09.930
Bubbles of vapor form inside the water,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.786
then they expand, turning liquid into gas.

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:18.590
In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.017
could come into existence because of quantum tunneling.

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:24.854
The bubble would then expand at the speed of light,

00:06:24.854 --> 00:06:28.340
invading all space, and turning the Higgs field

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.989
from the familiar state into a new state.

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.150
Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.895
We may not realize it in ordinary life,

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:42.100
but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.745
for the structure of matter.

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:48.818
If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,

00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:51.762
we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying

00:06:51.762 --> 00:06:55.448
inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.788
and hydrogen would be

00:06:57.788 --> 00:07:02.140
the only possible chemical element in the universe.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.151
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.965
is not just a few times more intense than today,

00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:11.160
but billions of times,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.362
and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,

00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:17.515
all atomic matter would collapse.

00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:22.005
No molecular structures would be possible, no life.

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:25.343
So, I wonder, is it possible

00:07:25.343 --> 00:07:27.929
that in the future, the Higgs field

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:30.494
will undergo a phase transition and,

00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:33.623
through quantum tunneling, will be transformed

00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:38.310
into this nasty, ultra-dense state?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.835
In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate

00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:44.918
of the Higgs field in our universe?

00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:47.169
And the crucial ingredient necessary

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:51.555
to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.

00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:55.666
And experiments at the LHC found that the mass

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:59.940
of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.976
This is tiny when expressed in familiar units,

00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:04.296
because it's equal to something like

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:06.503
10 to the minus 22 grams,

00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:10.473
but it is large in particle physics units,

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.577
because it is equal to the weight

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:14.823
of an entire molecule

00:08:14.823 --> 00:08:17.243
of a DNA constituent.

00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:20.630
So armed with this information from the LHC,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.574
together with some colleagues here at CERN,

00:08:22.574 --> 00:08:24.483
we computed the probability

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:27.498
that our universe could quantum tunnel

00:08:27.498 --> 00:08:30.616
into the ultra-dense Higgs state,

00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:34.293
and we found a very intriguing result.

00:08:34.293 --> 00:08:36.442
Our calculations showed

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:39.614
that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass

00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:41.459
is very special.

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:44.378
It has just the right value

00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:47.071
to keep the universe hanging

00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:49.641
in an unstable situation.

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:52.897
The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration

00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:54.946
that has lasted so far

00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:57.991
but that will eventually collapse.

00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.170
So according to these calculations,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.200
we are like campers

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.652
who accidentally set their tent

00:09:05.652 --> 00:09:07.446
at the edge of a cliff.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.236
And eventually, the Higgs field

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.172
will undergo a phase transition

00:09:11.172 --> 00:09:14.216
and matter will collapse into itself.

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:17.660
So is this how humanity is going to disappear?

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.415
I don't think so.

00:09:19.415 --> 00:09:22.768
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling

00:09:22.768 --> 00:09:26.424
of the Higgs field is not likely to occur

00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:29.928
in the next 10 to the 100 years,

00:09:29.928 --> 00:09:32.970
and this is a very long time.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.738
It's even longer than

00:09:34.738 --> 00:09:38.407
the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.814
(Laughter)

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.605
Even so, we will be long gone by then.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:47.213
In about five billion years,

00:09:47.213 --> 00:09:49.670
our sun will become a red giant,

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.183
as large as the Earth's orbit,

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:55.460
and our Earth will be kaput,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.817
and in a thousand billion years,

00:09:57.817 --> 00:10:00.103
if dark energy keeps on fueling

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:02.938
space expansion at the present rate,

00:10:02.938 --> 00:10:07.115
you will not even be able to see as far as your toes,

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:08.812
because everything around you

00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:12.513
expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.

00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:14.498
So it is really unlikely

00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:18.368
that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.947
But the reason why I am interested

00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:23.959
in the transition of the Higgs field

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:27.244
is because I want to address the question,

00:10:27.244 --> 00:10:32.209
why is the Higgs boson mass so special?

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:35.183
Why is it just right to keep the universe

00:10:35.183 --> 00:10:38.673
at the edge of a phase transition?

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:42.535
Theoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:45.210
More than how a phenomenon works,

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.682
theoretical physicists are always interested in

00:10:47.682 --> 00:10:50.914
why a phenomenon works in the way it works.

00:10:50.914 --> 00:10:54.276
We think that this these "why" questions

00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:55.999
can give us clues

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:59.537
about the fundamental principles of nature.

00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:03.442
And indeed, a possible answer to my question

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:07.806
opens up new universes, literally.

00:11:07.806 --> 00:11:11.247
It has been speculated that our universe

00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:15.380
is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.943
made out of a multitude of bubbles,

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:20.159
and each bubble is a different universe

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:22.053
with different fundamental constants

00:11:22.053 --> 00:11:23.918
and different physical laws.

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.924
And in this context, you can only talk about

00:11:25.924 --> 00:11:30.635
the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.

00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:32.978
Then the key to the mystery

00:11:32.978 --> 00:11:36.241
could lie in the statistical properties

00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:38.469
of the multiverse.

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:40.883
It would be something like what happens

00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:43.120
with sand dunes on a beach.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.992
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes

00:11:45.992 --> 00:11:48.422
of any slope angle in a beach,

00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:52.583
and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes

00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:56.053
are typically around 30, 35 degrees.

00:11:56.053 --> 00:11:57.721
And the reason is simple:

00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:01.399
because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:04.283
As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes

00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:08.202
have slope angles around the critical value,

00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:10.186
near to collapse.

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:13.183
And something similar could happen

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:17.720
for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.592
In the majority of bubble universes,

00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:23.649
the Higgs mass could be around the critical value,

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:27.245
near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,

00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:29.192
because of two competing effects,

00:12:29.192 --> 00:12:32.778
just as in the case of sand.

00:12:32.778 --> 00:12:35.923
My story does not have an end,

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:39.658
because we still don't know the end of the story.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.946
This is science in progress,

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:46.780
and to solve the mystery, we need more data,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.396
and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.017
to this story.

00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:57.847
Just one number, the Higgs boson mass,

00:12:57.847 --> 00:13:03.176
and yet, out of this number we learn so much.

00:13:03.176 --> 00:13:06.223
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles

00:13:06.223 --> 00:13:08.259
are all there is in the universe,

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.965
even beyond the domain explored so far.

00:13:10.965 --> 00:13:14.733
From this, we discovered that the Higgs field

00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:18.176
that permeates space-time may be standing

00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:22.733
on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:26.283
and we discovered that this may be a hint

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:30.316
that our universe is only a grain of sand

00:13:30.316 --> 00:13:33.929
in a giant beach, the multiverse.

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:37.180
But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.863
That's how physics works: A single measurement

00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:43.727
can put us on the road to a new understanding

00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:45.390
of the universe

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.409
or it can send us down a blind alley.

00:13:48.409 --> 00:13:50.973
But whichever it turns out to be,

00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:54.165
there is one thing I'm sure of:

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:57.514
The journey will be full of surprises.

00:13:57.514 --> 00:13:58.887
Thank you.

00:13:58.887 --> 00:14:04.135
