Nicole Paris: TEDYouth, make some noise!

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:16.619
(Beatboxing)

00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:18.144
TEDYouth, make some --

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:19.918
(Beatboxing)

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.216
(Beatboxing ends)

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.353
Are you ready?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.631
(Cheers and applause)

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:46.820
Are you ready?

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:49.356
Ed Cage: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.074
(Beatboxing)

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:57.572
(Laughter)

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.414
EC: Y'all like that? Let me show you
how we used to do it --

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:01.691
NP: Get it pops, go ahead.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:03.730
EC: ... when I was growing up in the '90s.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:05.869
(Beatboxing)

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:11.815
(Beatboxing ends)

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:14.408
(Laughter)

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:19.471
(Beatboxing)

00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:29.825
NP: Pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, pops,

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:31.842
hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up!

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.127
Oh my God.

00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:35.692
OK, he's trying to battle me.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:37.858
Hold on, right now, hold on.

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:41.871
Do you remember when you used
to beatbox me to sleep?

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:43.324
EC: Yeah, yeah, I remember.

00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:45.901
That's when she was a little baby.

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:47.467
We would do something like this.

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.490
(Beatboxing)

00:01:56.273 --> 00:01:57.720
NP: I remember that.

00:01:57.744 --> 00:01:59.697
(Beatboxing)

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.761
NP: All right, pops, pops, pops,
chill out, chill out.

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.273
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

00:02:12.297 --> 00:02:13.686
EC: Y'all remember the video.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.890
This is like a little payback or something

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:18.413
for 50 million people
calling me the loser.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.795
NP: Hold up, hold up.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.978
But a lot of people out there don't
really know what beatboxing is,

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:24.525
where it started from.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.700
EC: Right, right.

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:26.917
NP: Where it came from.

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.298
So why don't you give
them a little history --

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:32.013
just a tickle -- a bit of history
of where it comes from.

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:33.894
EC: Beatbox started here in New York.

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:35.069
(Cheers)

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:38.580
That's right, that's right.
New York, New York!

00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:40.231
Everybody like, "Yeah!"

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:41.745
Well, we from St. Louis.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.787
(Laughter)

00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.931
NP: Now you can put y'all hands down.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:46.254
(Laughter)

00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:48.255
EC: But beatbox started here in New York.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.970
What you would have is that,
when we would go to parties,

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:53.470
you would have the DJ
and you would have the rapper.

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:56.237
But because I don't have
electricity coming out of me,

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:59.386
we had to emulate
what the beats was doing.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.003
So when you would see the beatboxer,

00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:03.963
you would see us over to the side.

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:06.913
Then you would see a rapper,
and when the rapper began to rap,

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.191
we would do a simple beat,

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:10.237
because back then the beats were simple --

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:15.122
(Beatboxing)

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:16.297
or --

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:22.017
(Beatboxing)

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.868
Those were simple beats.

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:28.294
But now, you got folks that want
to do all type of stuff

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:29.535
with their beats now,

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.948
and they want to humiliate their father,

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:35.222
which is not right when you want
to humiliate the person

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:38.112
that take care of you, pay
all your tuition, (Nicole laughs)

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.523
especially when you have 50 million people

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:42.664
that just go around
and call you "the loser."

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.593
Well, I'm taking that to heart.

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:46.825
But now we do something
different in our house,

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.750
so we have these jam sessions,

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:53.008
and our jam sessions consist
of us jamming in church.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.465
You know, in church,
we'll look at each other like,

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.640
(Beatboxing)

00:03:56.664 --> 00:03:57.665
(Laughter)

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.527
and we'll text the beat to each other.

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:02.387
Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking,

00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.214
road trips, airports.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.964
NP: Standing right there in the corner,
"Aw, Dad -- listen to that."

00:04:07.988 --> 00:04:09.176
(Beatboxing)

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.185
Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what?

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:15.055
We're talking all about this
jam session and everything.

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.229
EC: Yeah.

00:04:16.253 --> 00:04:20.750
NP: Why don't we give them a little peek,
just a tiny bit of our jam session?

00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:24.316
NP: Y'all want to hear some jam session?
EC: Y'all ready for a jam session?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.341
(Cheers)

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.710
NP: Sorry? I can't hear you.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:27.735
(Cheers)

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.910
Yeah! Kick it, pops!

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.576
(Beatboxing)

00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:33.826
(Applause)

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:35.887
(Beatboxing)

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.265
(Beatboxing ends)

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.239
(Applause)

00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:10.621
NP: I'm getting ready to go!

00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.752
EC: Y'all ready? Everybody stand up!
Come on, everybody stand up!

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:16.470
Get on up! Come on, stretch!

00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:19.761
(Beatboxing)

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.610
(Beatboxing ends)

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.893
NP: That's it.

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:53.039
(Cheers and applause)

00:06:53.063 --> 00:06:54.366
Thank you! Make some noise!

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.588
EG: Thank you, everybody!

00:06:55.612 --> 00:06:57.492
NP: Make some noise! Make some noise!

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:58.667
Thank you!
