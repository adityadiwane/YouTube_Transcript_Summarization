00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:14.838
How much do you need
to know about a person

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:17.396
before you'd feel comfortable
making a loan?

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:20.499
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:22.837
to the person sitting two rows behind you.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.322
What would you need to know
about that person

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.267
before you'd feel comfortable?

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.215
My mom came to the US from India
in her late thirties.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.046
She's a doctor in Brooklyn,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.293
and she often lets friends and neighbors
come to see her for health services,

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:39.546
whether they can pay right away or not.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.162
I remember running into her patients
with her at the grocery store

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:44.337
or on the sidewalk,

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.201
and sometimes they would come
and pay her right on the spot

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:48.583
for previous appointments.

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:49.846
She would thank them,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.591
and ask them about their families
and their health.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.718
She gave them credit
because she trusted them.

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.489
Most of us are like my mom.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.762
We would give credit to someone we know

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:04.182
or that we live next to.

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:07.910
But most of us are probably not
going to lend to a stranger

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.000
unless we know a little
something about them.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:15.337
Banks, credit card companies
and other financial institutions

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.621
don't know us on a personal level,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:20.524
but they do have a way of trusting us,

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.009
and that's through our credit scores.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.028
Our credit scores have been created

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:29.572
through an aggregation and analysis
of our public consumer credit data.

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:32.837
And because of them, we have
pretty much easy access

00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.305
to all of the goods
and services that we need,

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.173
from getting electricity to buying a home,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.654
or taking a risk and starting a business.

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.722
But ...

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:47.113
there are 2.5 billion people
around the world

00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:49.223
that don't have a credit score.

00:01:49.247 --> 00:01:52.271
That's a third of the world's population.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.185
They don't have a score

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.470
because there are no formal
public records on them --

00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:58.858
no bank accounts,

00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:00.376
no credit histories

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.458
and no social security numbers.

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:04.201
And because they don't have a score,

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:08.876
they don't have access
to the credit or financial products

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.746
that can improve their lives.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.571
They are not trusted.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.138
So we wanted to find a way to build trust

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:22.213
and to open up financial access
for these 2.5 billion.

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:25.238
So we created a mobile application

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:29.552
that builds credit scores for them
using mobile data.

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:34.801
There are currently over one billion
smartphones in emerging markets.

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:37.813
And people are using them
the same way that we do.

00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:41.204
They're texting their friends,
they're looking up directions,

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:42.640
they're browsing the Internet

00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:45.143
and they're even making
financial transactions.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:48.353
Over time, this data is getting
captured on our phones,

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:52.172
and it provides a really rich picture
of a person's life.

00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.308
Our customers give us access to this data

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:58.442
and we capture it
through our mobile application.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.110
It helps us understand
the creditworthiness

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:05.835
of people like Jenipher,
a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.173
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades
has been running a food stall

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:13.255
in the central business district.

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:17.096
She has three sons who she put
through vocational school,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.644
and she's also the leader
of her local chama,

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.131
or savings group.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.532
Jenipher's food stall does well.

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:27.000
She makes just enough every day
to cover her expenses.

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:29.392
But she's not financially secure.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.582
Any emergency could force her into debt.

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:34.734
And she has no discretionary income

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:36.996
to improve her family's way of living,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.259
for emergencies,

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:40.956
or for investing
into growing her business.

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:45.291
If Jenipher wants credit,
her options are limited.

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.111
She could get a microloan,

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:50.979
but she'd have to form a group
that could help vouch for her credibility.

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.975
And even then, the loan sizes
would be way too small

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.256
to really have an impact on her business,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.568
averaging around 150 dollars.

00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:02.043
Loan sharks are always an option,

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:06.017
but with interest rates
that are well above 300 percent,

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.595
they're financially risky.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.064
And because Jenipher doesn't have
collateral or a credit history,

00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:15.875
she can't walk into a bank
and ask for a business loan.

00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.654
But one day,

00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:21.656
Jenipher's son convinced her
to download our application

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.931
and apply for a loan.

00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:25.946
Jenipher answered a few
questions on her phone

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.964
and she gave us access to a few
key data points on her device.

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.899
And here's what we saw.

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:33.891
So, bad news first.

00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:39.762
Jenipher had a low savings balance
and no previous loan history.

00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:41.546
These are factors

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.596
that would have thrown up
a red flag to a traditional bank.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.351
But there were other points
in her history that showed us

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:50.706
a much richer picture of her potential.

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:52.493
So for one,

00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:56.372
we saw that she made regular
phone calls to her family in Uganda.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.086
Well, it turns out that the data shows

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.844
a four percent increase in repayment

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:07.604
among people who consistently
communicate with a few close contacts.

00:05:08.657 --> 00:05:09.816
We could also see

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.648
that though she traveled
around a lot throughout the day,

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:15.403
she actually had pretty
regular travel patterns,

00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:18.562
and she was either at home
or at her food stall.

00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:23.302
And the data shows
a six percent increase in repayment

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:25.713
among customers who are consistent

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:28.346
with where they spend most of their time.

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.930
We could also see
that she communicated a lot

00:05:31.954 --> 00:05:34.302
with many different people
throughout the day

00:05:34.326 --> 00:05:36.668
and that she had a strong support network.

00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:38.680
Our data shows

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:43.384
that people who communicate
with more than 58 different contacts

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:46.309
tend to be more likely
to be good borrowers.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:47.602
In Jenipher's case,

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:51.669
she communicated
with 89 different individuals,

00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:54.944
which showed a nine percent
increase in her repayment.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:59.655
These are just some of the thousands
of different data points

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:02.912
that we look at to understand
a person's creditworthiness.

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:06.470
And after analyzing all
of these different data points,

00:06:06.494 --> 00:06:08.466
we took the first risk

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.533
and gave Jenipher a loan.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.696
This is data that would not
be found on a paper trail

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.288
or in any formal financial record.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.508
But it proves trust.

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.170
By looking beyond income,

00:06:22.194 --> 00:06:24.351
we can see that people in emerging markets

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:28.044
that may seem risky
and unpredictable on the surface

00:06:28.068 --> 00:06:32.294
are actually willing and have
the capacity to repay.

00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:38.519
Our credit scores have helped us deliver
over 200,000 loans in Kenya

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:40.140
in just the past year.

00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:43.466
And our repayment rates
are above 90 percent --

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.785
which, by the way, is in line
with traditional bank repayment rates.

00:06:49.564 --> 00:06:52.473
With something as simple
as a credit score,

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:56.012
we're giving people the power
to build their own futures.

00:06:56.647 --> 00:06:59.954
Our customers have used
their loans for family expenses,

00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:01.835
emergencies, travel

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.831
and for investing back
into growing their businesses.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:09.264
They're now building better
economies and communities

00:07:09.288 --> 00:07:11.612
where more people can succeed.

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:15.392
Over the past two years
of using our product,

00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:19.600
Jenipher has increased
her savings by 60 percent.

00:07:19.624 --> 00:07:22.276
She's also started
two additional food stalls

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.377
and is now making plans
for her own restaurant.

00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.805
She's applying for a small-business loan
from a commercial bank,

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:33.554
because she now has the credit history
to prove she deserves it.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.953
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:40.228
and she told me how excited
she was to get started.

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:41.540
She said,

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:47.657
"Only my son believed I could do this.
I didn't think this was for me."

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.536
She's lived her whole life

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.853
believing that there was a part
of the world that was closed off to her.

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:59.892
Our job now is to open
the world to Jenipher

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:04.111
and the billions like her
that deserve to be trusted.

00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:05.294
Thank you.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:09.650
(Applause)
