00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:14.827
I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:19.013
about a whole new way to think
about sexual activity

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:23.086
and sexuality education, by comparison.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.752
If you talk to someone today in America

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.576
about sexual activity,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.224
you'll find pretty soon
you're not just talking

00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:32.882
about sexual activity.

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:35.928
You're also talking about baseball.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:40.162
Because baseball is the dominant
cultural metaphor

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:42.680
that Americans use to think about

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:45.529
and talk about sexual activity,

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:47.077
and we know that because there's

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.661
all this language in English

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.606
that seems to be talking about baseball

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.465
but that's really talking
about sexual activity.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.664
So, for example, you can
be a pitcher or a catcher,

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:01.591
and that corresponds to whether you

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.359
perform a sexual act
or receive a sexual act.

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:06.365
Of course, there are the bases,

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:09.583
which refer to specific sexual activities

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:12.798
that happen in a very specific order,

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.576
ultimately resulting in scoring a run

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.580
or hitting a home run,

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:18.888
which is usually having
vaginal intercourse

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.600
to the point of orgasm,

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.993
at least for the guy.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:24.922
(Laughter)

00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:26.423
You can strike out, which means

00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:28.908
you don't get to have any sexual activity.

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.266
And if you're a benchwarmer,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.681
you might be a virgin or somebody who for

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.930
whatever reason isn't in the game,

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:38.095
maybe because of your age
or because of your ability

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.141
or because of your skillset.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:42.759
A bat's a penis,

00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:46.828
and a nappy dugout
is a vulva, or a vagina.

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.936
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.853
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person,

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:56.545
and we gay and lesbian folks
play for the other team.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.144
And then there's this one:

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:03.168
"if there's grass
on the field, play ball."

00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:05.572
And that usually refers to

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:08.929
if a young person, specifically
often a young woman,

00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:10.661
is old enough to have pubic hair,

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:13.386
she's old enough to have sex with.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.369
This baseball model
is incredibly problematic.

00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:18.720
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.096
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.879
And it can't result in healthy sexuality

00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:26.927
developing in young people or in adults.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.649
So we need a new model.

00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:31.208
I'm here today to offer
you that new model.

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:32.983
And it's based on

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:34.809
pizza.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:38.256
Now pizza is something
that is universally understood

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.153
and that most people associate
with a positive experience.

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:42.133
So let's do this.

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:45.102
Let's take baseball
and pizza and compare it

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:48.546
when talking about three aspects
of sexual activity:

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.199
the trigger for sexual activity,

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:52.417
what happens during sexual activity,

00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:55.569
and the expected outcome
of sexual activity.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.377
So when do you play baseball?

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.817
You play baseball when
it's baseball season

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:03.099
and when there's a game on the schedule.

00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:05.409
It's not exactly your choice.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:08.305
So if it's prom night or a wedding night

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.375
or at a party or if our parents
aren't home,

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.107
hey, it's just batter up.

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:15.893
Can you imagine saying to your coach,

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:18.394
"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,

00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:20.461
I think I'll sit this game out."

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:22.553
That's just not the way it happens.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.625
And when you get together
to play baseball,

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.076
immediately you're
with two opposing teams,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.406
one playing offense, one playing defense,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.201
somebody's trying to move
deeper into the field.

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:34.134
That's usually a sign to the boy.

00:03:34.158 --> 00:03:37.170
Somebody's trying to defend
people moving into the field.

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.399
That's often given to the girl.

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:40.434
It's competitive.

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.223
We're not playing with each other.

00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:43.630
We're playing against each other.

00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:45.562
And when you show up to play baseball,

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:48.106
nobody needs to talk
about what we're going to do

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.647
or how this baseball game
might be good for us.

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:51.910
Everybody knows the rules.

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:56.289
You just take your position
and play the game.

00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:58.649
But when do you have pizza?

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:02.891
Well, you have pizza when
you're hungry for pizza.

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.985
It starts with an internal sense,
an internal desire, or a need.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.657
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.914
(Laughter)

00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:15.891
And because it's an internal desire,

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:18.249
we actually have some sense
of control over that.

00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:19.803
I could decide that I'm hungry

00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:23.334
but know that it's not
a great time to eat.

00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:25.996
And then when we get together
with someone for pizza,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.846
we're not competing with them,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.346
we're looking for an experience

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.632
that both of us will share

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:33.606
that's satisfying for both of us,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.611
and when you get together
for pizza with somebody,

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:38.159
what's the first thing you do?

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:40.081
You talk about it.

00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:41.612
You talk about what you want.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.105
You talk about what you like.

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.661
You may even negotiate it.

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:47.430
"How do you feel
about pepperoni?" (Laughter)

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.057
"Not so much, I'm kind
of a mushroom guy myself."

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.123
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."

00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:54.147
And even if you've had pizza with somebody

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.182
for a very long time,

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:59.244
don't you still say things like,

00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:01.237
"Should we get the usual?"

00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:02.400
(Laughter)

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:06.157
"Or maybe something
a little more adventurous?"

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.991
Okay, so when you're playing baseball,

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.109
so if we talk
about during sexual activity,

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.514
when you're playing baseball,

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:14.042
you're just supposed to round the bases

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:16.522
in the proper order one at a time.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.737
You can't hit the ball
and run to right field.

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:19.959
That doesn't work.

00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:22.277
And you also can't get
to second base and say,

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:26.677
"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.098
No.

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:30.503
And also, of course,
with baseball, there's, like,

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:33.003
the specific equipment
and a specific skill set.

00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:36.630
Not everybody can play baseball.
It's pretty exclusive.

00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:38.288
Okay, but what about pizza?

00:05:38.312 --> 00:05:40.884
When we're trying to figure
out what's good for pizza,

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:43.569
isn't it all about what's our pleasure?

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.301
There are a million different
kinds of pizza.

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:47.087
There's a million different toppings.

00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:49.389
There's a million different
ways to eat pizza.

00:05:49.413 --> 00:05:52.338
And none of them are wrong.
They're different.

00:05:52.362 --> 00:05:54.786
And in this case, difference is good,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.858
because that's going
to increase the chance

00:05:56.882 --> 00:05:59.442
that we're having a satisfying experience.

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:02.402
And lastly, what's the expected
outcome of baseball?

00:06:02.426 --> 00:06:06.100
Well, in baseball, you play to win.

00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:08.633
You score as many runs as you can.

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:10.621
There's always a winner in baseball,

00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:14.042
and that means there's always
a loser in baseball.

00:06:14.066 --> 00:06:15.698
But what about pizza?

00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:17.909
Well, in pizza, we're not really --

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:21.576
there's no winning. How do you win pizza?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.831
You don't. But you do look for,

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:26.552
"Are we satisfied?"

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.624
And sometimes that can
be different amounts

00:06:28.648 --> 00:06:30.791
over different times
or with different people

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:32.708
or on different days.

00:06:32.732 --> 00:06:35.838
And we get to decide
when we feel satisfied.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:38.676
If we're still hungry,
we might have some more.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.214
If you eat too much, though,

00:06:40.238 --> 00:06:42.119
you just feel gross.

00:06:42.143 --> 00:06:44.528
(Laughter)

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:47.214
So what if we could take this pizza model

00:06:47.238 --> 00:06:50.586
and overlay it on top
of sexuality education?

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.125
A lot of sexuality education
that happens today

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:56.551
is so influenced by the baseball model,

00:06:56.575 --> 00:07:00.344
and it sets up education that can't help

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:04.077
but produce unhealthy
sexuality in young people.

00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:06.340
And those young people
become older people.

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:09.799
But if we could create sexuality education

00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:12.148
that was more like pizza,

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:15.596
we could create education
that invites people

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.891
to think about their own desires,

00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:21.143
to make deliberate decisions
about what they want,

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:23.775
to talk about it with their partners,

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:25.448
and to ultimately look for

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:28.592
not some external outcome

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:31.749
but for what feels satisfying,

00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:34.268
and we get to decide that.

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:35.029
You may have noticed

00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:37.908
in the baseball and pizza comparison,

00:07:37.932 --> 00:07:40.748
under the baseball, it's all commands.

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:42.845
They're all exclamation points.

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:45.914
But under the pizza
model, they're questions.

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:47.796
And who gets to answer those questions?

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.456
You do. I do.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.356
So remember, when we're thinking about

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.102
sexuality education and sexual activity,

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:58.292
baseball, you're out.

00:07:58.316 --> 00:08:01.524
Pizza is the way to think about healthy,

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:03.964
satisfying sexual activity,

00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:06.904
and good, comprehensive
sexuality education.

00:08:06.928 --> 00:08:09.134
Thank you very much for your time.

00:08:09.158 --> 00:08:13.820
(Applause)
