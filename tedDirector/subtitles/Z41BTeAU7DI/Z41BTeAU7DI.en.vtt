00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
This machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
reminds me of an aphorism, of a

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
comment of Woody Allen

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And it's this machine.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
things today that we couldn't do yesterday.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
And of course it's born stupid.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
The last time you were in the presence of a baby --

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Isn't she fabulous?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
(Laughter)

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
But nonetheless when she popped out

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
in its development for several months before

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
on the basis of her experiences in the womb --

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
nonetheless she had very limited abilities,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
as does every infant

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
In fact there is little evidence that there is any

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
cognitive ability in a very young infant.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Infants don't respond to much.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
(Laughter)

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
control their movements.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
It would be several months before this infant

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
could do something as simple as reach out and grasp

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
under voluntary control an object and retrieve it,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
usually to the mouth.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And it will be some months beforeward,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
and we see a long steady progression

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
of the evolution from the first wiggles,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
standing, walking,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
before we get to that magical point

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
in which we can motate in the world.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And yet, when we look forward in the brain

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
we see really remarkable advance.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
By this age the brain can actually store.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
It has stored, recorded,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
can fastly retrieve

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
the meanings of thousands,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
tens of thousands of objects,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
actions, and their relationships in the world.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
potentially millions of ways.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
This brain is very much a thinking machine.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
And by this age there is absolutely no question

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
that this brain, it has a person on board.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
in its capacity to control movement.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Now movement has advanced to the point

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
where it can actually control movement simultaneously,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
in a complex sequence, in complex ways

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
as would be required for example

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
for playing a complicated game,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
like soccer.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
You could go out into the community in Monterey,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
(Laughter)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
That's all another way of saying

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
that our individual skills and abilities

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
are very much shaped by our environments.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
That environment extends into our contemporary culture,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
the thing our brain is challenged with.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
that are specific to our own individual histories.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
And in fact they result in a wonderful

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
differentiation in humankind,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
in the way that, in fact, no two of us

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
are quite alike.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
that all derive out of the plasticity,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.160
the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
In an adult brain of course we've built up

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
that we can perform more or less automatically from memory,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
Now we study this,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
by engaging the brains

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
of animals like rats, or monkeys,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
or of this particularly curious creature --

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And we try to track the changes that occur

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
as the new skill or ability is acquired.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
In fact we do this in individuals

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
of any age, in these different species --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
that is to say from infancies,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.160
infancy up to adulthood and old age.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
So we might engage a rat, for example,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
to acquire a new skill or ability

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
that might involve the rat using its paw

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
to master particular manual grasp behaviors

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
just like we might examine a child

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
and their ability to acquire the sub-skills,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
or the general overall skill of accomplishing something

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
like mastering the ability to read.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
Or you might look in an older individual

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
who has mastered a complex set of abilities

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
that might relate to reading musical notation

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
or performing the mechanical acts of performance

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
that apply to musical performance.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
From these studies we defined two great epochs

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
of the plastic history of the brain.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
in its initial form its basic processing machinery.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
This is actually a period of dramatic change

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
All it takes for example in the sound domain,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
is exposure to sound.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
And the brain actually is at the mercy

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
of the sound environment in which it is reared.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
So for example I can rear an animal

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
a repertoire of sound that I make up,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
that I make, just by exposure, artificially important

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
to the animal and its young brain.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
its initial processing of that sound

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
to represent it in an organized and orderly way.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
like the sounds that simulate

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
the sounds of a native language of a child.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
I can raise an animal under conditions

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
that would be equivalent to raising a baby

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
under a moderately loud ceiling fan,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
in the presence of continuous noise.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And I frustrate its ability

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Such things in the early history of babies

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
occur in real babies.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
And they account for, for example

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
in every normally developing baby.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And so they also account for

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
development of defective processing

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
in a substantial population of children

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
who are more limited, as a consequence,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
in their language abilities at an older age.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
Now in this early period of plasticity

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
so that it can act differentially,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
so that it can act selectively,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
so that the creature that wears it, that carries it,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
can begin to operate on it in a selective way.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
the brain is actually refining its machinery

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
And in this epoch,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
which extends from late in the first year of life to death;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
it's actually doing this under behavioral control.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
And that's another way of saying

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
the brain has strategies that define

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
the significance of the input to the brain.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
And it's focusing on skill after skill,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
or ability after ability,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
under specific attentional control.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
This is actually very powerful.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
is powerfully expressed.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
It is the basis of our real differentiation,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
one individual from another.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
You can look down in the brain of an animal

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
that's engaged in a specific skill,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
So here is a very simple experiment.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
It was actually conducted about five years ago

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
in Marseilles.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
in a task that involves it manipulating a tool

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that's equivalent in its difficulty

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
The monkey actually mastered the task

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
in about 700 practice tries.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Those tries were elaborate.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And 700 or so tries later

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
At this point the task is being performed

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
in a beautifully stereotyped way:

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
We can look down in the brain of the monkey.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
And we see that it's distorted.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
in many such behaviors across time.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
And here we see the distortion

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
location by location,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
We see here a reconstruction of how

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
the hand is represented in the brain.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
If we look at the selectivity of responses

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
in the cortex of the monkey,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
which represents input from the skin

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
of the fingertips that are engaged.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
in this most organized of cortical areas

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
of the surface of the skin of the body.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
Monkey has like you have.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you --

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
part of acquiring the skill or ability.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
in the monkey learning this task.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
to the skill or ability.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
So for example we can look to the cortical area

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
and the sequences of movements

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
that are required in the behavior, and so forth.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
when you learn a simple skill like this.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.160
And that represents in your brain, really massive change.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
It represents the change in a reliable way

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
of the responses of tens of millions,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
It represents changes

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
of hundreds of millions, possibly billions

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
of synaptic connections in your brain.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
This is constructed by physical change.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
Or acquiring their native language abilities.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
The changes are massive.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
What it's all about is the selective representations

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
of things that are important to the brain.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
Because in most of the life of the brain

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
this is under control of behavioral context.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
It's what you pay attention to.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
It's what's rewarding to you.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
It's what the brain regards, itself,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
as positive and important to you.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
It's all about cortical processing

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
and forebrain specialization.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And that underlies your specialization.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
That is why you, in your many skills and abilities,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
are a unique specialist:

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
a specialist that's vastly different

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
in your physical brain in detail

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
than the brain of an individual 100 years ago;

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
enormously different in the details

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
is that information is always related

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
to other inputs or information that is occurring

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
in immediate time, in context.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
that are correlated in little moments of time

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
The brain is recording all information

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and driving all change

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
in temporal context.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
that's occurred in your brain is you.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
Billions of events have occurred in your history

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
that are related in time to yourself

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
as the receiver,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
yourself as the mover.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
from the surface of your body

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
that are always associated with you as the receiver,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
and that result in

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
the embodiment of you.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
You are constructed, your self is constructed

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
from these billions of events.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
And it's created in the brain via physical change.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
This is a marvelously constructed thing

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
that results in individual form

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
because each one of us has vastly different histories,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
and vastly different experiences,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
of personhood.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Now we've used this research

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
to try to understand not just how a normal person develops,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
and elaborates their skills and abilities,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
but also try to understand

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
the origins of impairment,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
and the origins of differences or variations

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
I'm going to talk about using these strategies

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
to actually design brain plasticity-based

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
that increases the competence of the child

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
as a language receiver and user

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
and, thereafter, as a reader.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
actually using this brain science,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.160
And then, by using it in a targeted approach

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
we're going to try to differentiate

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.160
the machinery to recover function in old age.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
So the first example I'm going to talk about

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
relates to children with learning impairments.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
We now have a large body of literature

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
that demonstrates that the fundamental

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
problem that occurs in the majority of children

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
that have early language impairments,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
and that are going to struggle to learn to read,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
is that their language processor

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
is created in a defective form.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
And the reason that it rises in a defective form

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.160
is because early in the baby's brain's life

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
the machine process is noisy.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
It's that simple.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.160
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
There are numerous inherited faults

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
that could make the machine process noisier.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
on the basis of information provided

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
in the world from the ears.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
was born with what we called mental retardation.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.160
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.160
and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.160
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
That's disappeared. That no longer applies.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
That inherited weakness, that inherited condition

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
has evaporated.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
about 35 years ago,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
that if you simply fix the problem early enough,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
when the brain is still in this initial plastic period

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
so it can set up this machinery adequately,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
in this initial set up time in the critical period,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
none of that happens.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
You're basically opening up

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
which have had them reliably full.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.160
It's degraded.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
The child's native language is such a case is not English.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
It's not Japanese.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160
It's crap.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
And the brain specializes for it.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
It creates a representation of language crap.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
And then the child is stuck with it.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
It can also happen in the brain.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
And the native language for a child with such a brain

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160
is degraded.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
It's not English. It's noisy English.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
not normal -- a different strategy,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
They are about an order of magnitude longer,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
about 11 times longer in duration on average,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
than in a normal child.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160
Space constants are about three times greater.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.160
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160
in this domain.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
they are receiving it and representing it,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
and in information it's representing crap.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
And they are going to have poor reading skills.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
into this orthographic or visual

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
representational form.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
that translation makes no sense.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
Then these children increasingly

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
in evaluation after evaluation,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
in their operations in language, and their operations in reading --

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.160
we document that abnormal neurology.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
the processing capacity of the machinery

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
by changing it.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.160
Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.160
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.160
Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160
And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
So here we're looking at the normal distribution.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160
This is from about 3,000 children.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
are moving into the middle or the right.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
This is like an IQ test for language.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.160
The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
and narrow the distribution.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
This is a substantially large impact.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
We have the potential to move most of those children

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
to the middle or to the right side.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160
In addition to accurate language training

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.160
it also fixes memory and cognition

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.160
speech fluency and speech production.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160
that is to say reading.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
And to a large extent it fixes the brain.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
You can look down in the brain of a child

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.160
and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.160
And children operating in various language behaviors,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
or in various reading behaviors,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.160
you see for the most extent,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.160
for most children, their neuronal responses,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160
complexly abnormal before you start,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.160
are normalized by the training.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160
Now you can also take the same approach

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
to address problems in aging.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.160
from competent machinery, it's going south.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.160
Noise is increasing in the brain.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.160
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
and witness a change in the time constants and space constants

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.160
with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.160
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.160
it's going back into chaos in the end.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
This results in declines in memory

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.160
this is a small population of such individuals --

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.160
train equally intensively for about 30 hours.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.160
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.160
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160
of their ability to remember things after a delay,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160
of their ability to control their attention,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160
their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
The overall neuropsychological index

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
of these trained individuals in this population

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.160
is about two standard deviations.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.160
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160
and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160
the average person has moved to the middle

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
or the right side of the distribution.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
It means that most people who are at risk for senility,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160
more or less immediately,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.160
are now in a protected position.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160
My issues are to try to get to rescuing

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160
older citizens more completely and in larger numbers,

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160
because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160
and the same for kids.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
I'm specifically interested in things like autism,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.160
and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.160
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.160
and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.160
Your issues as it relates to this science,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.160
is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160
And of course, a well-ordered life

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.160
But also in your future is brain aerobics.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.160
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.160
not too far in the future,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.160
just like physical exercise

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.160
is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.160
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.160
literature and the science that is important to you

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.160
is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.160
Now that you know, now that science is telling us

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.160
that you are in charge,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.160
that it's under your control,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160
that your happiness, your well-being,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
your abilities, your capacities,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.160
are capable of continuous modification,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
continuous improvement,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
and you're the responsible agent and party.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
It will be a long time before they really understand it.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160
(Laughter)

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
Now that's another issue and not my fault.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
Okay. Thank you.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.160
(Applause)
