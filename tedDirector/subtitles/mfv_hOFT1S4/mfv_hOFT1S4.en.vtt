00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
very, very north end of it there,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
where it's absolutely freezing cold.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.330
(Laughter)

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.330
I couldn't pick a career.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.330
(Laughter)

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
My mother wanted me to be a dentist.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
So I actually went to school in Belfast,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
which was where all the action happened.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
And this was a pretty common sight.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
The school I went to was pretty boring.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
They forced us to learn things like Latin.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
The school teachers weren't having much fun,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
the sports were very dirty or very painful.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And I was actually rowing for my school here

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.330
of the entire school.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
And that was the finishing post right there.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.330
(Laughter)

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.330
So this was extremely embarrassing.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
But our school at that time got a grant from the government,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
and they left the programming manuals lying around.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And so students like myself with nothing to do,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
we would learn how to program it.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
Also around this time, at home,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
this was the computer that people were buying.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
So I brought a picture with big hair.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.330
(Laughter).

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
I just want to get that out of the way.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Sinclair ZX81.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.330
(Laughter)

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.330
And -- you see the picture at the bottom?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
That's what they thought they had built it for.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
The reality is we got the programming manual

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.330
and we started making games for it.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.330
We were programming in BASIC,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
which is a pretty awful language for games,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
so we ended up learning Assembly language

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
so we could really take control of the hardware.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.330
and he's showing his machine.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
You had this same thing in America,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
The graphics were just horrible.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.330
"Death Rider."

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
They started making their own video games.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
so males choose the lucky rabbit.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
which was quite the leap.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And if you're wondering how much 16K is,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
this eBay logo here is 16K.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And in that amount of memory someone programmed

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
a full flight simulation program.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
And that's what it looked like.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
I spent ages flying this flight simulator,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
smiling in this photograph.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
So I went on for the next 20 years or so

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
making a lot of different games.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.330
Because I was from the United Kingdom,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
so they decided to call it hero instead.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
I personally preferred the Spanish version,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
which was "Tortugas Ninja."

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
That was much better.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
(Laughter)

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and Hollywood to actually work together on something --

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
so I've done that.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.330
It grows every year.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
Last year was the biggest year.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
43 percent of gamers are female.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
The average age of gamers?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
Well, obviously it's for children, right?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.330
Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
So 37 is our target audience.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.330
All video games are violent.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
so it's just not true.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Online gaming statistics.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
making the publisher about another 275 million.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
so basically it pays for itself in about a month.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
A player in a game called "Project Entropia"

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
You have to remember that this is not a real island.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
But he got great terms on it.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
This purchase included mining and hunting rights,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
ownership of all land on the island, and a castle

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
with no furniture included.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.330
(Laughter)

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
by the gamers themselves.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
They found clever ways to trade items

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
and to sell their accounts to each other

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
so that they could make money while they were playing their games.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.330
just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
I liked this one the best:

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.330
a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
So as far as popularity of games,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
what do you think these people are doing here?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.330
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.330
That's what the show looks like.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
And the people that went there absolutely loved it.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.330
What do you think these people are doing?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
against each other.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
And this is happening in every city around the world.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
This is happening in your local cities too,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.330
you're probably just not aware of it.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
so ridiculously better.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
10 years from now.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
So we're going to start that video.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
Video: Throughout human history people have played games.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
As man's intellect and technology have evolved

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
so too have the games he plays.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:09:05.330
(Music)

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
(Applause)

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
Think about that's where we are right now,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
to get better.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
You need to be really an incredible artist.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.330
more fantasy artists that can create places

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.330
we've never been to before, or characters that

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.330
we've just never seen before.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
But if you were to go to a game developers conference,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
meaning, understanding and feeling.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
I came across a student who's absolutely excellent

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
at expressing himself, and this student agreed

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
that he would not show his video to anybody until

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.330
you here at TED had seen it.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
So I'd like to play this video.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
reality and video games.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
has become programmed, electronic and virtual.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
has finally begun to crumble.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
I'm a video game addict and this is my story.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:42.330
(Music)

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.330
In the year of my birth

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
I played in the backyard, learned to read,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
and even ate some of my vegetables.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.330
Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
But as was the case for most of my generation,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
left their mark on me.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.330
whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:27.330
electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
At some point something clicked.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:41.330
(Music)

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
With the combination of simple, interactive stories

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
became more than just an escape.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.330
It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:12:11.330
(Music)

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.330
I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.330
a certain number of hours I have spent playing,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
and video games had begun to erode my own understanding

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
of what is real and what is not.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
I still crave more.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:44.330
(Music)

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
in what unfolded before me on screen.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.330
Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.330
even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
A generation who may experience much more meaning

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
through video games than they will through the real world.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.330
may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
Play enough video games and eventually you will

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.330
drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
I know I can.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
downloaded, streaming, HD reality.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
We are interacting with our entertainment.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
I have come to expect this level of interaction.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
Without it, the problems faced in the real world --

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.330
poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
of prime time TV.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
more real than any textbook or any news story.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
The people who create these games are smart.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.330
They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.330
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.330
A well-designed video game will seamlessly

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.330
weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
As one becomes more experienced

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
the awareness of physical control melts away.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
I know what I want and I do it.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.330
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.330
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
I know violent video games make my mother worry.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
What troubles me is not that video game violence

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.330
is becoming more and more like real life violence,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
but that real life violence is starting to look more and more

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
like a video game.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:31.330
(Music)

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
These are all troubles outside of myself.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
I, however, have a problem very close to home.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
Something has happened to my brain.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:50.330
(Music)

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
before we even think.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
and all of them are hardwired into our brains.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:07.330
These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.330
allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.330
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
in the same cities and doing many of the same things

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.330
we once did in real life, only virtually.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
Consider this --

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.330
In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.330
To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
The sensory cues are very similar.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
doing something on the TV than you have in real life.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
this is almost as beautiful as my games are.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
For my virtual worlds are perfect.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.330
but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.330
on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.330
Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
brainwashing the masses with video games

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.330
rather than just simply TVs.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.330
completely vulnerable to re-programming.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.330
But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.330
Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.330
or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.330
in the real world.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.330
There is a potential to do good as well.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.330
It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.330
the real world we live in, that game developers realize

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
that they have tremendous responsibilities before them.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.330
I'm not sure what the future of video games holds

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.330
for our civilization.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.330
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.330
there is a greater and greater potential for other people

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
to feel the same way I do.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.330
What I have only recently come to realize

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.330
is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.330
and addictive to me.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
I know that I am losing my grip.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.330
Part of me is just waiting to let go.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.330
I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.330
or how flat the real world may seem to us,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.330
that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:34.330
and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.330
(Applause)

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.330
DP: Wow.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:46.330
(Applause)

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.330
I found that video very, very thought provoking,

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.330
and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.330
And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.330
for me to talk about was graphics and audio.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.330
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
Video games give an awful lot of other things too,

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.330
and that's why people get so addicted.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.330
The most important one being fun.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.330
The name of this track is "The Magic To Come."

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.330
Who is that going to come from?

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.330
Is it going to come from the best directors in the world

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.330
as we thought it probably would?

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.330
I don't think so.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.330
I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.330
that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.330
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
The same with students or highly creative people,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.330
writers and people like that.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.330
As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.330
teaching video game courses.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.330
That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.330
Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.330
There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.330
try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:49.330
(Laughter)

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.330
Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.330
He's out of time.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.330
DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.330
CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.330
(Laughter)

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.330
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.330
because they want to pitch their video game ideas.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.330
I'm sitting at the front of the class,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.330
and they're actually pitching their ideas.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.330
So it's hard to get students to come back to class,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.330
but it is possible.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.330
This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.330
And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.330
in the video game world?

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
And as I've shown here, we have the audience.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.330
and have millions of people ready to play.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.330
You know, we have the technology.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.330
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.330
stunning and really immersive.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.330
And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.330
She's never going to know a world where video games

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.330
aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.330
I just hope she likes video games.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.330
(Laughter)

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.330
So, my closing thought.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.330
Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.330
but for those that like to look a little deeper,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.330
the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.330
to creative minds that like to think big.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.330
Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.330
Thank you.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.330
Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.
