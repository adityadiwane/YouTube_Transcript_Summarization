00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I specialize in human behavioral research,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and to design for that future.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But I've got a pretty good idea

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how people will behave when they get there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This is my office. It's out there.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's not in the lab,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
About three billion people, by the end of this year,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
will have cellular connectivity.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I mention this because,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if we want to design for that future,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we need to figure out what those people are about.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and what our team's job is.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Our research often starts with a very simple question.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If you think of everything in your life that you own,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
when you walk out that door,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
what do you consider to take with you?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When you're looking around, what do you consider?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Of that stuff, what do you carry?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So this is interesting to us,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because the conscious and subconscious decision process

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And to put it really bluntly, you know,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I've probably done about five years' research

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
looking at what people carry.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and we follow them around town with video cameras.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's kind of like stalking with permission.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
what do people carry?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
OK, that's fair enough.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
across cultures and across gender and across contexts --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
most people will say keys, money

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and, if they own one, a mobile phone.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You'd probably kick me out, or something.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But really, the question is, why? Right?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So why are these things so important in our lives?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
survival for us and survival for our loved ones.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
among all its other uses.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
those three objects are very good at supporting

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but they're very good at this.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to allow people to transcend space and time.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And what I mean by that is, you know,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And they value that connectivity.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And you can do them with phone kiosks.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You don't need to ask permission from anyone,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
you can just go ahead and do it, right?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
However, for these things to help us survive,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it depends on them being carried.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I think, quite a nice feature.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So we forget, but we're also adaptable,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And so we have these strategies to remember,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and one of them was mentioned yesterday.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And you turn around, and you look back into the space,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and some people talk aloud.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but most people have what we call a center of gravity.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but over time, they gravitate there.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's where you expect to find stuff.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And in fact, when you're turning around,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and you're looking inside the house,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and you're looking for this stuff,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
this is where you look first, right?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
OK, so when we did this research,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to never forget anything ever, ever again.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And from a design perspective,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and what you can delegate to other people.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
can be the solution for pretty much everything,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And apart from things like entertainment,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
or, at least, not yet.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and how people who are illiterate communicate.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And one of the things we were looking at is --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
if you can't read and write,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
if you want to communicate over distances,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
you need to be able to identify the person

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that you want to communicate with.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it could be a postal address.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Simple question: if you can't read and write,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
how do you manage your contact information?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And the fact is that millions of people do it.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and so that's just one small example

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
of the kind of research that we were doing.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the stuff that they can't do themselves.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Let me give you another example of delegation.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
This one's a little bit more sophisticated,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and this is from a study that we did in Uganda

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And it works like this.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and that's the phone kiosk operator.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I call up the local village operator.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and it's now being topped up in the village.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and passes the rest over to you in cash.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
OK, there's two things I like about this.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
anyone who has a mobile phone --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
essentially into an ATM machine.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It brings rudimentary banking services to places

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
where there's no banking infrastructure.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
There's a second thing I like about this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I know I could never have designed something as elegant

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But the difference between this and that

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
is, there's no central authority trying to control this.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This is just street-up innovation.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
inspiration for us.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
They'll give you a new one.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and you can see people taking down a phone

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and putting it back together.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
They reverse-engineer manuals.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is a kind of hacker's manual,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and it's written in Chinese and English.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They also write them in Hindi.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
You can subscribe to these.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
There are training institutes where they're churning out people

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
for fixing these things as well.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But what I like about this is,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It challenges the norms.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I'm not going to answer that, OK.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of trust and confidence in the purchase process.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is a pair of underpants from --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Laughter) --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
from Tibet.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And I look at something like this and it makes me question,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
if we were to take all the functionality in things like this,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and redistribute them around the body

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
in some kind of personal area network,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
how would we prioritize where to put stuff?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
kind of personal area networks.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
written above the shack in rural Uganda.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
for those extra three billion people.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
This is how it's shifting.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And this is from Delhi.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It's from a study we did into illiteracy,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and it's a guy in a teashop.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You can see the chai being poured in the background.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
on the lowest rungs in the society.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And he, somehow, has the appreciation

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
of the values of Livestrong.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And it's not necessarily the same values,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
but some kind of values of Livestrong,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to actually go out and purchase them,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and actually display them.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
For me, this kind of personifies this connected world,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
where everything is intertwined, and the dots are --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
it's all about the dots joining together.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences,"

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
has the ability to transcend space and time

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in a personal and convenient manner, right?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
When everyone's connected.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And there are four things.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
the speed at which ideas go around.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And I know TED is about big ideas,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that's the first thing.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
things like banking, identity --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And so the speed of the adoption of things

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is just going to become that much more rapid,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
when you get it to 6.3 billion

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and the growth in the world's population.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The next thing is that, however we design this stuff --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
carefully design this stuff --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
as long as it meets base needs --

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the ability to transcend space and time, for example.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
That's my feeling.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
both what we design and how we design.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
With another three billion people connected,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
they want to be part of the conversation.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And we need to learn how to listen.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So thank you very, very much.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
(Applause)
