00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.951
Why do people deliberately
destroy cultural heritage?

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:19.521
By doing so,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:23.139
do they believe
they're erasing our history?

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.987
Our cultural memory?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.067
It's true that we are losing
cultural heritage to erosion

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:32.900
and natural disasters,

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:35.858
but this is something
that is simply difficult to avoid.

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:40.802
I'm here to show you today
how we can use pictures --

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.684
your pictures --

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:45.828
to reclaim the history that is being lost

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:48.075
using innovative technology

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:50.202
and the effort of volunteers.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.023
In the early 20th century,

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:58.035
archaeologists discovered
hundreds of statues and artifacts

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.793
at the ancient city of Hatra,

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:00.967
in northern Iraq.

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:05.577
Statues like this one
were found in fragments,

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.738
some of them missing their heads or arms,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.275
yet the clothing that they are wearing

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.745
and their pose

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:15.052
can still tell us their story.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:17.209
For example,

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.967
we believe that by wearing
a knee-length tunic

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.491
and open bare feet,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.096
this was representative of a priest.

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:29.603
However, with a closer look
at this particular piece,

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:34.049
we can see that this tunic being worn
was elaborately decorated,

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.895
which has led many researchers to believe

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:40.792
this was actually a statue of a king
performing his religious functions.

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:49.017
When the Mosul Cultural Museum
opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.288
this statue, as well as others,

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:54.476
were placed there to preserve them
for future generations.

00:01:56.085 --> 00:02:00.024
Following the US-led invasion
of Iraq in 2003,

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:03.913
a few statues and artifacts
were relocated to Baghdad,

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:06.012
but this statue remained.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:11.026
Then in February of last year,
a video was released,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.451
and it instantly went viral.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:16.166
Maybe some of you remember seeing it.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.723
Here's a short clip.

00:02:17.747 --> 00:02:24.647
(Video) (Singing in Arabic)

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.609
(Singing ends)

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:48.319
Not a very pleasant sight, right?

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.139
Did you notice anything
familiar in the video?

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:54.875
There it is.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.571
There is that very statue,

00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.338
as it was toppled over,

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:00.882
breaking into pieces.

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:04.657
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:05.949
we were shocked.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.307
Since we are archaeologists
using innovative technology

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.121
for digital preservation,

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:13.704
an idea sprung to mind.

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:19.135
Maybe we can crowdsource the images
that were taken of these artifacts

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.974
before they were destroyed,

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:22.941
to create digital reconstructions.

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:24.735
If we can do that,

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.850
maybe we can put them
into a virtual museum

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.108
to tell that story.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.354
And so two weeks after we saw this video,

00:03:35.378 --> 00:03:38.517
we started the project
called Project Mosul.

00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:42.921
Remember the pictures of the statue
I showed you before?

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:47.668
This is actually the crowdsourced
reconstruction of it

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:49.297
before it was destroyed.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.719
Now, many of you may be wondering,

00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:54.481
how exactly does this work?

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:58.161
Well, the key to this technology
is called photogrammetry,

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.641
and it was invented here, in Germany.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.116
It is the technology that allows us
to use two-dimensional images

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.089
taken of the same object
from different angles

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:09.508
to create a 3D model.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:15.288
I know you may be thinking
this sounds like magic -- but it's not.

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:16.843
Let me show you how it works.

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.638
Here are two crowdsourced images
of the same statue.

00:04:20.748 --> 00:04:22.143
What the computer can do

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.382
is it can detect similar features
between the photographs --

00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:28.439
similar features of the object.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.365
Then, by using multiple photos,

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.117
in this case, it can begin
to reconstruct the object in 3D.

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:37.785
In this case,

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.241
you have the position of the cameras
when each image was taken,

00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:42.443
shown in blue.

00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:47.516
Now, this is a partial
reconstruction, I admit,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.132
but why would I say partial?

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:54.116
Well, simply because the statue
was positioned against a wall.

00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.294
We don't have photographs
taken of it from the back.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.111
If I wanted to complete a full
digital reconstruction of this statue,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.844
I would need a proper camera,

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:06.613
tripods, proper lighting,

00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:09.127
but we simply can't do that
with crowdsourced images.

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.119
Think about it:

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.376
How many of you, when you visit a museum,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.641
take photographs
of all parts of the statue,

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.130
even the back side of it?

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:21.823
Well, maybe if some of you find
Michelangelo's David interesting,

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:22.998
I guess --

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.506
(Laughter)

00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:26.477
But the thing is,

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.641
if we can find more images of this object,

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.289
we can improve the 3D model.

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:35.127
When we started the project,

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:37.300
we started it with
the Mosul Museum in mind.

00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:38.991
We figured we may get a few images,

00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:40.261
some people interested,

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.764
make one or two virtual reconstructions,

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:47.547
but we had no idea that we had sparked
something that would grow so quickly.

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:49.649
Before we knew it,

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.704
we realized it was obvious:

00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:55.632
we could apply this same idea
to lost heritage anywhere.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.394
And so, we decided to change
the name of the project to Rekrei.

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:04.347
Then, in the summer of last year,

00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:07.411
"The Economist" magazine's media lab
reached out to us.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.667
They asked us,

00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:12.458
"Hey, would you like us
to build a virtual museum

00:06:12.482 --> 00:06:14.347
to put the reconstructions back inside,

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:15.651
to tell the story?"

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:17.788
Can you imagine us saying no?

00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:19.113
Of course not.

00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:20.288
We said yes!

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:21.469
We were so excited.

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:24.673
This was exactly
the initial dream of that project.

00:06:25.482 --> 00:06:26.669
And so now,

00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:30.307
any of you can experience
RecoVR Mosul on your phone,

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:31.624
using Google Cardboard

00:06:31.648 --> 00:06:34.295
or a tablet or even YouTube 360.

00:06:34.864 --> 00:06:38.320
Here is a screenshot
from the virtual museum.

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:39.494
And there it is ...

00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.629
the partial reconstruction of the statue,

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:45.520
as well as the Lion of Mosul,

00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:48.216
the first reconstruction
completed by our project.

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:54.149
Although the video doesn't explicitly show
the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:58.306
we have many other examples
of large artifacts being destroyed

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.471
that were simply too large
to have been stolen.

00:07:01.992 --> 00:07:03.355
For example,

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.165
the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.

00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:09.336
This is a digital
reconstruction from before,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.725
and this is actually
during the destruction.

00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:16.846
Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria:

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.020
before ...

00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:19.871
and after.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:24.636
Although virtual reconstructions
are primarily the main focus

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.842
of our project,

00:07:25.866 --> 00:07:27.929
some people have been asking the question:

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:31.750
Can we print them in 3D?

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:36.632
We believe 3D printing
doesn't offer a straightforward solution

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:37.846
to lost heritage.

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.107
Once an object is destroyed,

00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.281
it's gone.

00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:46.899
But 3D printing does offer
an addition to tell that story.

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.914
For example, I can show you here ...

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.394
There is the statue from Hatra

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:58.238
and the Lion of Mosul.

00:07:58.262 --> 00:08:05.262
(Applause)

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.840
Thank you.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:08.368
Now, if you look closely,

00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:12.899
you'll notice that there are some parts
that have been printed in color,

00:08:12.923 --> 00:08:15.506
and some parts that are in white or gray.

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:20.337
This part was added
simply to hold the statues up.

00:08:20.654 --> 00:08:23.081
This works the same way
if you visit a museum,

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:25.386
and a statue is found in fragments;

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.680
it's put together
for the people to see it.

00:08:27.704 --> 00:08:29.160
This makes sense, right?

00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.094
However, we're much more interested

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:35.513
in what virtual reality
has to offer for lost heritage.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.741
Here is an example
of one of the tower tombs

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:40.640
that was destroyed in Palmyra.

00:08:40.664 --> 00:08:42.618
Using Sketchfab's online viewer,

00:08:42.642 --> 00:08:48.297
we can show that we have reconstructed
three parts of the exterior of the tomb,

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.226
but we also have photos of the inside,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.919
so we're beginning to create
a reconstruction of the wall

00:08:52.943 --> 00:08:54.093
and the ceiling.

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.508
Archaeologists worked there
for many, many years,

00:08:57.532 --> 00:09:02.269
so we also have architectural
drawing plans of this lost heritage.

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:10.541
Unfortunately, we are not only losing
cultural heritage to areas of conflict

00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:11.716
and at war --

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.039
we're also losing it to natural disasters.

00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:18.568
This is a 3D model
of Durbar Square in Kathmandu,

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:21.242
before the earthquake
that occurred last April ...

00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:23.367
and this is after.

00:09:24.383 --> 00:09:25.981
You may be thinking,

00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:29.674
you didn't create these 3D models
with only tourist photographs,

00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:31.089
and that's true.

00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:32.589
But what this represents

00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:36.359
is the ability for large, public
organizations and private industry

00:09:36.383 --> 00:09:38.793
to come together
for initiatives like ours.

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:44.667
And so one of the major challenges
of our project, really,

00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:48.579
is to find photographs that were taken
before something happens, right?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.464
Well, the internet is basically a database
with millions of images, right?

00:09:55.488 --> 00:09:56.839
Exactly.

00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:00.298
So we have begun to develop a tool

00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:04.244
that allows us to extract images
from websites like Flickr,

00:10:04.268 --> 00:10:05.766
based on their geotags,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.373
to complete reconstructions.

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:14.979
Because we're not only losing cultural
heritage to natural disasters and in war,

00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:17.972
but we're also losing it
to something else.

00:10:19.597 --> 00:10:22.128
Any idea, just looking
at these two pictures?

00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:26.109
Maybe it's a little difficult to remember,

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:28.553
but only a few weeks ago,

00:10:28.577 --> 00:10:33.187
this was the example of human
destruction by human stupidity.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:39.078
Because a tourist in Lisbon
wanted to climb onto this statue

00:10:39.102 --> 00:10:40.467
and take a selfie with it --

00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:41.492
(Laughter)

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.048
and pulled it down with him.

00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:45.405
So we're already finding photographs

00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:47.583
to complete a digital
reconstruction of this.

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:50.080
We need to remember

00:10:50.104 --> 00:10:54.651
that the destruction of cultural heritage
isn't a recent phenomenon.

00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:56.802
In the 16th century,

00:10:56.826 --> 00:11:03.304
European priests and explorers burned
thousands of Maya books in the Americas,

00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:05.841
of which we only have a handful left.

00:11:07.264 --> 00:11:08.995
Fast-forward to 2001,

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:12.326
when the Taliban blew up
the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.

00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:15.309
You see,

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:19.400
cultural heritage
is about our shared global history.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.381
It helps us connect
with our ancestors and their stories,

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:28.676
but we're losing pieces of it
every day to natural disasters

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.986
and in areas of conflict.

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:36.632
Of course, the loss of human life
is the most heartbreaking loss ...

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:43.398
but cultural heritage offers us a way
to preserve the memory of the people

00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:44.932
for future generations.

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:50.105
We need your help to reclaim
the history that is being lost.

00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:52.409
Will you join us?

00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:55.708
(Applause)
