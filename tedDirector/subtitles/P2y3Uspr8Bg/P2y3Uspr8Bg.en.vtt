00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.735
So this right here

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.816
is the tiny village of Elle,
close to Lista.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.200
It's right at the southernmost
tip of Norway.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.736
And on January 2 this year,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.976
an elderly guy who lives in the village,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.896
he went out to see what was cast ashore

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.520
during a recent storm.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.296
And on a patch of grass
right next to the water's edge,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.320
he found a wetsuit.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320
It was grey and black,
and he thought it looked cheap.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.296
Out of each leg of the wetsuit

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
there were sticking two white bones.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.320
It was clearly the remains
of a human being.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.296
And usually, in Norway,
dead people are identified quickly.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.856
So the police started searching

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.976
through missing reports
from the local area,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.216
national missing reports,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.696
and looked for accidents
with a possible connection.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.920
They found nothing.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.416
So they ran a DNA profile,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.576
and they started searching
internationally through Interpol.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.800
Nothing.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.760
This was a person
that nobody seemed to be missing.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.160
It was an invisible life
heading for a nameless grave.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.736
But then, after a month,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.056
the police in Norway got a message
from the police in the Netherlands.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.696
A couple of months earlier,
they had found a body,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.000
in an identical wetsuit,
and they had no idea who this person was.

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:40.696
But the police in the Netherlands
managed to trace the wetsuit

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.096
by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.296
So they were then able to tell

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.656
that both wetsuits were bought
by the same customer at the same time,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.136
October 7, 2014,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.760
in the French city of Calais
by the English Channel.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.936
But this was all
they were able to figure out.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.616
The customer paid cash.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.256
There was no surveillance
footage from the shop.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.760
So it became a cold case.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.056
We heard this story,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.319
and it triggered me and my colleague,
photographer Tomm Christiansen,

00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:15.416
and we of course had the obvious question:
who were these people?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440
At the time, I'd barely
heard about Calais,

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:20.295
but it took about two
or three seconds to figure out

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.256
Calais is basically known for two things.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.096
It's the spot in continental Europe
closest to Britain,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.656
and a lot of migrants and refugees
are staying in this camp

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.896
and are trying desperately
to cross over to Britain.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.856
And right there was a plausible theory
about the identity of the two people,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.256
and the police made this theory as well.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.471
Because if you or I or anybody else
with a firm connection to Europe

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:46.696
goes missing off the coast of France,
people would just know.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.976
Your friends or family
would report you missing,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.776
the police would come search for you,
the media would know,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.056
and there would be
pictures of you on lampposts.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.128
It's difficult to disappear
without a trace.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.976
But if you just fled the war in Syria,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.976
and your family,
if you have any family left,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.056
don't necessarily know where you are,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.096
and you're staying here illegally

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.960
amongst thousands of others
who come and go every day.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.120
Well, if you disappear one day,
nobody will notice.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.886
The police won't come search for you
because nobody knows you're gone.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.896
And this is what happened
to Shadi Omar Kataf

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.240
and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:27.816
Me and Tomm went to Calais
for the first time in April this year,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.176
and after three months of investigation,
we were able to tell the story

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.976
about how these two young men
fled the war in Syria,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.736
ended up stuck in Calais,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.136
bought wetsuits and drowned
in what seems to have been an attempt

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.120
to swim across the English Channel
in order to reach England.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.496
It is a story about the fact
that everybody has a name,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.960
everybody has a story,
everybody is someone.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.096
But it is also a story about what
it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.056
So this is where we started our search.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.576
This is in Calais.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.696
Right now, between 3,500
and 5,000 people are living here

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.296
under horrible conditions.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.296
It has been dubbed
the worst refugee camp in Europe.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.376
Limited access to food,
limited access to water,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.896
limited access to health care.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.200
Disease and infections are widespread.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.096
And they're all stuck here
because they're trying to get to England

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.536
in order to claim asylum.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.096
And they do that by hiding in the back
of trucks headed for the ferry,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.320
or the Eurotunnel,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.776
or they sneak inside
the tunnel terminal at night

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.680
to try to hide on the trains.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.456
Most want to go to Britain
because they know the language,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.976
and so they figure it would be easier
to restart their lives from there.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.816
They want to work, they want to study,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.976
they want to be able
to continue their lives.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.936
A lot of these people are
highly educated and skilled workers.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.496
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,
you'll meet lawyers, politicians,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.176
engineers, graphic designers,
farmers, soldiers.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.629
You've got the whole spectrum.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.896
But who all of these people are

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.376
usually gets lost in the way
we talk about refugees and migrants,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.416
because we usually do that in statistics.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.616
So you have 60 million refugees globally.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.656
About half a million
have made the crossing

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.136
over the Mediterranean
into Europe so far this year,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.416
and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.936
But these are numbers,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.776
and the numbers don't say anything
about who these people are,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.280
where they came from, or why they're here.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.879
And first, I want to tell you
about one of them.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.096
This is 22-year-old
Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.016
We first heard about him
after being in Calais the first time

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.816
looking for answers to the theory
of the two dead bodies.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.976
And after a while, we heard this story

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.296
about a Syrian man
who was living in Bradford in England,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.096
and had been desperately searching
for his nephew Mouaz for months.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.096
And it turned out the last time
anybody had heard anything from Mouaz

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.776
was October 7, 2014.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.360
That was the same date
the wetsuits were bought.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.376
So we flew over there and we met the uncle

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.496
and we did DNA samples of him,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.816
and later on got additional DNA samples
from Mouaz's closest relative

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.040
who now lives in Jordan.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.696
The analysis concluded

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.216
the body who was found in a wetsuit
on a beach in the Netherlands

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.160
was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.216
And while we were doing
all this investigation,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.080
we got to know Mouaz's story.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.216
He was born in the Syrian capital
of Damascus in 1991.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.098
He was raised in a middle class family,

00:06:21.122 --> 00:06:23.789
and his father in the middle there
is a chemical engineer

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:28.096
who spent 11 years in prison for belonging
to the political opposition in Syria.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.736
While his father was in prison,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.016
Mouaz took responsibility
and he cared for his three sisters.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.016
They said he was that kind of guy.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.816
Mouaz studied to become
an electrical engineer

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.416
at the University of Damascus.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.416
So a couple of years into the Syrian war,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.576
the family fled Damascus and went
to the neighboring country, Jordan.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.136
Their father had problems
finding work in Jordan,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.136
and Mouaz could not continue his studies,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.456
so he figured, "OK, the best thing
I can do to help my family

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.216
would be to go somewhere
where I can finish my studies

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.776
and find work."

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.216
So he goes to Turkey.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.880
In Turkey, he's not accepted
at a university,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.216
and once he had left Jordan as a refugee,
he was not allowed to reenter.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.856
So then he decides to head for the UK,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.416
where his uncle lives.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.576
He makes it into Algeria,
walks into Libya,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.416
pays a people smuggler to help him
with the crossing into Italy by boat,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.336
and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.040
the city right next to Calais
by the English Channel.

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:29.336
We know he made at least 12 failed
attempts to cross the English Channel

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.960
by hiding in a truck.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.200
But at some point,
he must have given up all hope.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.416
The last night we know he was alive,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.960
he spent at a cheap hotel
close to the train station in Dunkirk.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.997
We found his name in the records,
and he seems to have stayed there alone.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.616
The day after, he went into Calais,
entered a sports shop

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.096
a couple of minutes
before 8 o'clock in the evening,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.656
along with Shadi Kataf.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.696
They both bought wetsuits,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.136
and the woman in the shop

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.732
was the last person we know of
to have seen them alive.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.056
We have tried to figure out
where Shadi met Mouaz,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.496
but we weren't able to do that.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.616
But they do have a similar story.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.536
We first heard about Shadi
after a cousin of his, living in Germany,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.016
had read an Arabic translation
of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.374
So we got in touch with him.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.456
Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.856
was also raised in Damascus.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.416
He was a working kind of guy.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.856
He ran a tire repair shop
and later worked in a printing company.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.776
He lived with his extended family,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.736
but their house got bombed
early in the war.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.680
So the family fled to an area
of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.936
Yarmouk is being described
as the worst place to live

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.159
on planet Earth.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.015
They've been bombed by the military,
they've been besieged,

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.421
they've been stormed by ISIS

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.296
and they've been cut off
from supplies for years.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.463
There was a UN official
who visited last year,

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:03.607
and he said, "They ate all the grass
so there was no grass left."

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.816
Out of a population of 150,000,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.936
only 18,000 are believed
to still be left in Yarmouk.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.016
Shadi and his sisters got out.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.040
The parents are still stuck inside.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.936
So Shadi and one of his sisters,
they fled to Libya.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.627
This was after the fall of Gaddafi,

00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:26.891
but before Libya turned
into full-blown civil war.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.456
And in this last remaining
sort of stability in Libya,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.600
Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed
to spend most of his time underwater.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800
He fell completely in love with the ocean,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.896
so when he finally decided
that he could no longer be in Libya,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.176
late August 2014,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.080
he hoped to find work
as a diver when he reached Italy.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.440
Reality was not that easy.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.336
We don't know much about his travels

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.056
because he had a hard time
communicating with his family,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.096
but we do know that he struggled.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.496
And by the end of September,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.806
he was living on the streets
somewhere in France.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.856
On October 7, he calls
his cousin in Belgium,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.856
and explains his situation.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.056
He said, "I'm in Calais. I need you
to come get my backpack and my laptop.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.016
I can't afford to pay the people smugglers
to help me with the crossing to Britain,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.280
but I will go buy a wetsuit
and I will swim."

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.016
His cousin, of course,
tried to warn him not to,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.176
but Shadi's battery
on the phone went flat,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.000
and his phone was never switched on again.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.576
What was left of Shadi
was found nearly three months later,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.536
800 kilometers away

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.600
in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.696
He's still waiting
for his funeral in Norway,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.280
and none of his family
will be able to attend.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.616
Many may think that the story
about Shadi and Mouaz

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.440
is a story about death,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.016
but I don't agree.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.496
To me, this is a story about two questions
that I think we all share:

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.296
what is a better life,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.640
and what am I willing to do to achieve it?

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.536
And to me, and probably a lot of you,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.136
a better life would mean

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.056
being able to do more
of what we think of as meaningful,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.080
whether that be spending more time
with your family and friends,

00:11:14.104 --> 00:11:15.616
travel to an exotic place,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.976
or just getting money
to buy that cool new device

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.696
or a pair of new sneakers.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.440
And this is all
within our reach pretty easily.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.776
But if you are fleeing a war zone,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.776
the answers to those two questions
are dramatically different.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.056
A better life is a life in safety.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.416
It's a life in dignity.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.096
A better life means
not having your house bombed,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.656
not fearing being kidnapped.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.109
It means being able
to send your children to school,

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.296
go to university,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.736
or just find work to be able to provide
for yourself and the ones you love.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.376
A better life would be
a future of some possibilities

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.696
compared to nearly none,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.480
and that's a strong motivation.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.576
And I have no trouble imagining

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.096
that after spending weeks or even months

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.016
as a second-grade citizen,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.176
living on the streets
or in a horrible makeshift camp

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.656
with a stupid, racist name
like "The Jungle,"

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.200
most of us would be willing
to do just about anything.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.456
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.536
the second they stepped into the freezing
waters of the English Channel,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.320
they would probably say,
"This is worth the risk,"

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.120
because they could
no longer see any other option.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.600
And that's desperation,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.800
but that's the reality of living
as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.976
Thank you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.216
(Applause)

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.550
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.816
This is Tomm Christiansen,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.602
who took most of the pictures you have
seen and they've done reporting together.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.056
Tomm, you two have been
back to Calais recently.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.696
This was the third trip.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.776
It was after the publication
of the article.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.936
What has changed?
What have you seen there?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.389
Tomm Christiansen:
The first time we were in Calais,

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.056
it was about 1,500 refugees there.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.736
They had a difficult time,
but they were positive, they had hope.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.776
The last time, the camp has grown,
maybe four or five thousand people.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.376
It seemed more permanent,
NGOs have arrived,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.216
a small school has opened.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.616
But the thing is that the refugees
have stayed for a longer time,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.536
and the French government has managed
to seal off the borders better,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.616
so now The Jungle is growing,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.856
along with the despair
and hopelessness among the refugees.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.576
BG: Are you planning to go back?
And continue the reporting?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.816
TC: Yes.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.856
BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.296
and to me, it's amazing
that in the current climate

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.856
of slashing budgets
and publishers in crisis,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.776
Dagbladet has consented
so many resources for this story,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.658
which tells a lot about newspapers
taking the responsibility,

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:00.602
but how did you sell it to your editors?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.376
Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.376
because we weren't able to know
what we actually could figure out.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.656
As soon as it became clear

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.136
that we actually could be able
to identify who the first one was,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.216
we basically got the message
that we could do whatever we wanted,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.256
just travel wherever you need to go,
do whatever you need to do,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.400
just get this done.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.056
BG: That's an editor
taking responsibility.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.700
The story, by the way,
has been translated and published

00:14:28.724 --> 00:14:31.976
across several European countries,
and certainly will continue to do.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.536
And we want to read the updates from you.
Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.960
(Applause)
