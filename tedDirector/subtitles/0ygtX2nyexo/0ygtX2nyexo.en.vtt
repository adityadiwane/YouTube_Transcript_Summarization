00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.236
I would like to tell you
about the most embarrassing thing

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.060
that has ever happened to me in my years
of working as a palliative care physician.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.396
This happened a couple of years ago.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.356
I was asked as a consultant
to see a woman in her 70s --

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.276
retired English professor
who had pancreatic cancer.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.820
I was asked to see her because
she had pain, nausea, vomiting ...

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.396
When I went to see her,
we talked about those symptoms

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.316
and in the course of that consultation,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.060
she asked me whether I thought
that medical marijuana might help her.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.476
I thought back to everything

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.836
that I had learned in medical school
about medical marijuana,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.700
which didn't take very long
because I had learned absolutely nothing.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.436
And so I told her that as far as I knew,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.916
medical marijuana
had no benefits whatsoever.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.596
And she smiled and nodded and reached
into the handbag next to the bed,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.636
and pulled out a stack of about a dozen
randomized controlled trials

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.315
showing that medical
marijuana has benefits

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:20.596
for symptoms like nausea
and pain and anxiety.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.516
She handed me those articles and said,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.820
"Maybe you should read these
before offering an opinion ...

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.916
doctor."

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.156
(Laughter)

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.036
So I did.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.556
That night I read all of those articles
and found a bunch more.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.716
When I came to see her the next morning,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.476
I had to admit that it looks like
there is some evidence

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.836
that marijuana can offer medical benefits

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.516
and I suggested that if she
really was interested,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.060
she should try it.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.820
You know what she said?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.420
This 73-year-old,
retired English professor?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.436
She said, "I did try it
about six months ago.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.996
It was amazing.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.716
I've been using it every day since.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.996
It's the best drug I've discovered.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.156
I don't know why it took me 73 years
to discover this stuff. It's amazing."

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.196
(Laughter)

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.356
That was the moment at which I realized

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.636
I needed to learn something
about medical marijuana

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.516
because what I was prepared for
in medical school

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.980
bore no relationship to reality.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.276
So I started reading more articles,
I started talking to researchers,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.716
I started talking to doctors,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.500
and most importantly,
I started listening to patients.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.956
I ended up writing a book
based on those conversations,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.076
and that book really revolved
around three surprises --

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.076
surprises to me, anyway.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.636
One I already alluded to --

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.796
that there really are some benefits
to medical marijuana.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.556
Those benefits may not be
as huge or as stunning

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.516
as some of the most avid proponents
of medical marijuana

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.756
would have us believe,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.060
but they are real.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.156
Surprise number two:

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.876
medical marijuana does have some risks.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.916
Those risks may not be
as huge and as scary

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.276
as some of the opponents of medical
marijuana would have us believe,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.700
but they are real risks, nonetheless.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.716
But it was the third surprise
that was most ...

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.196
surprising.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.236
And that is that a lot
of the patients I talked with

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.956
who've turned to medical
marijuana for help,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.916
weren't turning to medical marijuana
because of its benefits

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.956
or the balance of risks and benefits,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.356
or because they thought
it was a wonder drug,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.116
but because it gave them
control over their illness.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.316
It let them manage their health

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.516
in a way that was productive and efficient

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.100
and effective and comfortable for them.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.996
To show you what I mean,
let me tell you about another patient.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.196
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.596
She looked though
like she was in her late 60s.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.876
She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
for the last 20 years,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.316
her hands were gnarled by arthritis,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.076
her spine was crooked,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.716
she had to rely
on a wheelchair to get around.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.356
She looked weak and frail,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.636
and I guess physically she probably was,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.636
but emotionally,
cognitively, psychologically,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.340
she was among the toughest
people I've ever met.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.556
And when I sat down next to her

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.236
in a medical marijuana dispensary
in Northern California

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.676
to ask her about why she turned
to medical marijuana,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.676
what it did for her and how it helped her,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.436
she started out by telling me things

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.476
that I had heard
from many patients before.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.476
It helped with her anxiety;

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.876
it helped with her pain;

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.956
when her pain was better,
she slept better.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.436
And I'd heard all that before.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.116
But then she said something
that I'd never heard before,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.916
and that is that it gave her
control over her life

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.636
and over her health.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.756
She could use it when she wanted,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.196
in the way that she wanted,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.636
at the dose and frequency
that worked for her.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.036
And if it didn't work for her,
then she could make changes.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.476
Everything was up to her.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.196
The most important thing she said

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.876
was she didn't need
anybody else's permission --

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.516
not a clinic appointment,
not a doctor's prescription,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.076
not a pharmacist's order.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.996
It was all up to her.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.820
She was in control.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.036
And if that seems like a little thing
for somebody with chronic illness,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.260
it's not -- not at all.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.276
When we face a chronic serious illness,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.596
whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
or lupus or cancer or diabetes,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.116
or cirrhosis,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.956
we lose control.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.516
And note what I said: "when," not "if."

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.796
All of us at some point in our lives
will face a chronic serious illness

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.316
that causes us to lose control.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.196
We'll see our function decline,
some of us will see our cognition decline,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.876
we'll be no longer able
to care for ourselves,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.156
to do the things that we want to do.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.276
Our bodies will betray us,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.876
and in that process, we'll lose control.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.796
And that's scary.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.956
Not just scary -- that's frightening,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.556
it's terrifying.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.236
When I talk to my patients,
my palliative care patients,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.156
many of whom are facing illnesses
that will end their lives,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.236
they have a lot of be frightened of --

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.876
pain, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, fatigue,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.196
their impending mortality.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.796
But what scares them
more than anything else

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.996
is this possibility that at some point,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.196
tomorrow or a month from now,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.356
they're going to lose
control of their health,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.996
of their lives,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.396
of their healthcare,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.916
and they're going to become
dependent on others,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.820
and that's terrifying.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.076
So it's no wonder really
that patients like Robin,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.116
who I just told you about,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.556
who I met in that clinic,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.116
turn to medical marijuana

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.596
to try to claw back
some semblance of control.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.876
How do they do it though?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.556
How do these medical
marijuana dispensaries --

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.556
like the one where I met Robin --

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.276
how do they give patients like Robin
back the sort of control that they need?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.596
And how do they do it

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.676
in a way that mainstream
medical hospitals and clinics,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.036
at least for Robin, weren't able to?

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.876
What's their secret?

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.556
So I decided to find out.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.716
I went to a seedy clinic
in Venice Beach in California

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.036
and got a recommendation

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.596
that would allow me
to be a medical marijuana patient.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.636
I got a letter of recommendation
that would let me buy medical marijuana.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.476
I got that recommendation illegally,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.556
because I'm not
a resident of California --

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.796
I should note that.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.556
I should also note, for the record,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.116
that I never used that letter
of recommendation to make a purchase,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.836
and to all of you DEA agents out there --

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.076
(Laughter)

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.676
love the work that you're doing,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.916
keep it up.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.956
(Laughter)

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.409
Even though it didn't let me
make a purchase though,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.116
that letter was priceless
because it let me be a patient.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.356
It let me experience
what patients like Robin experience

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.396
when they go to a medical
marijuana dispensary.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.836
And what I experienced --

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.076
what they experience every day,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.556
hundreds of thousands
of people like Robin --

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.796
was really amazing.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.076
I walked into the clinic,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.756
and from the moment that I entered
many of these clinics and dispensaries,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.356
I felt like that dispensary, that clinic,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.020
was there for me.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.596
There were questions
at the outset about who I am,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.476
what kind of work I do,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.556
what my goals are in looking
for a medical marijuana prescription,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.396
or product,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.796
what my goals are,
what my preferences are,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.076
what my hopes are,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.756
how do I think, how do I hope
this might help me,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.396
what am I afraid of.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.996
These are the sorts of questions

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.476
that patients like Robin
get asked all the time.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.436
These are the sorts of questions
that make me confident

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.116
that the person I'm talking with
really has my best interests at heart

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.820
and wants to get to know me.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.716
The second thing I learned
in those clinics

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.916
is the availability of education.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.756
Education from the folks
behind the counter,

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.996
but also education
from folks in the waiting room.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.556
People I met were more than happy,
as I was sitting next to them --

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.835
people like Robin --

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:53.636
to tell me about who they are,
why they use medical marijuana,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.876
what helps them, how it helps them,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.836
and to give me advice and suggestions.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.500
Those waiting rooms really are
a hive of interaction, advice and support.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.716
And third, the folks behind the counter.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.116
I was amazed at how willing
those people were

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.676
to spend sometimes an hour or more
talking me through the nuances

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.756
of this strain versus that strain,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.476
smoking versus vaporizing,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.236
edibles versus tinctures --

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.020
all, remember, without me
making any purchase whatsoever.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.876
Think about the last time
you went to any hospital or clinic

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.700
and the last time anybody spent an hour
explaining those sorts of things to you.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.116
The fact that patients like Robin
are going to these clinics,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.716
are going to these dispensaries

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.676
and getting that sort
of personalized attention

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.556
and education and service,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.996
really should be a wake-up call
to the healthcare system.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.996
People like Robin are turning away
from mainstream medicine,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.356
turning to medical marijuana dispensaries

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.260
because those dispensaries
are giving them what they need.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.836
If that's a wake-up call
to the medical establishment,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.636
it's a wake-up call that many
of my colleagues are either not hearing

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.380
or not wanting to hear.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.796
When I talk to my colleagues,
physicians in particular,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.156
about medical marijuana,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.836
they say, "Oh, we need more evidence.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.820
We need more research into benefits,
we need more evidence about risks."

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.276
And you know what? They're right.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.556
They're absolutely right.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.756
We do need much more evidence
about the benefits of medical marijuana.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.156
We also need to ask the federal government
to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.740
or to deschedule it entirely
to make that research possible.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.236
We also need more research
into medical marijuana's risks.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.636
Medical marijuana's risks --

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.036
we know a lot about
the risks of recreational use,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.956
we know next to nothing
about the risks of medical marijuana.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.556
So we absolutely do need research,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.916
but to say that we need research

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.996
and not that we need
to make any changes now

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.956
is to miss the point entirely.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.556
People like Robin
aren't seeking out medical marijuana

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.436
because they think it's a wonder drug,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.196
or because they think
it's entirely risk-free.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.876
They seek it out because the context
in which it's delivered and administered

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.116
and used,

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.676
gives them the sort of control
they need over their lives.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.740
And that's a wake-up call
we really need to pay attention to.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.596
The good news though is that
there are lessons we can learn today

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.596
from those medical marijuana dispensaries.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.756
And those are lessons
we really should learn.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.516
These are often small,
mom-and-pop operations

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.996
run by people with no medical training.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.596
And while it's embarrassing to think

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.676
that many of these clinics
and dispensaries are providing services

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.076
and support and meeting patients' needs

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.116
in ways that billion-dollar
healthcare systems aren't --

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.836
we should be embarrassed by that --

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.756
but we can also learn from that.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.916
And there are probably
three lessons at least

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.180
that we can learn
from those small dispensaries.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.316
One: we need to find ways
to give patients more control

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.356
in small but important ways.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.436
How to interact with healthcare providers,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.636
when to interact
with healthcare providers,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.276
how to use medications
in ways that work for them.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.516
In my own practice,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.276
I've gotten much more
creative and flexible

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.436
in supporting my patients
in using drugs safely

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.956
to manage their symptoms --

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.356
with the emphasis on safely.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.836
Many of the drugs I prescribe
are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.636
which can be dangerous if overused.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.876
But here's the point.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.956
They can be dangerous if they're overused,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.876
but they can also be ineffective
if they're not used in a way

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.556
that's consistent with
what patients want and need.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.796
So that flexibility,
if it's delivered safely,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.916
can be extraordinarily valuable
for patients and their families.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.156
That's number one.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.196
Number two: education.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.436
Huge opportunities

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.916
to learn from some of the tricks
of those medical marijuana dispensaries

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.316
to provide more education

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.076
that doesn't require
a lot of physician time necessarily,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.836
or any physician time,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.236
but opportunities to learn
about what medications we're using

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.476
and why,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.556
prognoses, trajectories of illness,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.796
and most importantly,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.556
opportunities for patients
to learn from each other.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.516
How can we replicate what goes on

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.956
in those clinic and medical
dispensary waiting rooms?

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.660
How patients learn from each other,
how people share with each other.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.676
And last but not least,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.756
putting patients first the way
those medical marijuana dispensaries do,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.596
making patients feel
legitimately like what they want,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.876
what they need,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.596
is why, as healthcare providers,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.820
we're here.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.676
Asking patients about their hopes,
their fears, their goals and preferences.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.156
As a palliative care provider,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.700
I ask all my patients what they're
hoping for and what they're afraid of.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.636
But here's the thing.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.156
Patients shouldn't have to wait
until they're chronically seriously ill,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.996
often near the end of life,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.316
they shouldn't have to wait
until they're seeing a physician like me

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.076
before somebody asks them,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.356
"What are you hoping for?"

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.636
"What are you afraid of?"

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.060
That should be baked into the way
that healthcare is delivered.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.996
We can do this --

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.236
we really can.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.636
Medical marijuana dispensaries
and clinics all across the country

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.436
are figuring this out.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.716
They're figuring this out

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:14.236
in ways that larger, more mainstream
health systems are years behind.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.636
But we can learn from them,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.196
and we have to learn from them.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.556
All we have to do is swallow our pride --

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.236
put aside the thought for a minute

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.756
that because we have
lots of letters after our name,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.036
because we're experts,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.196
because we're chief medical officers
of a large healthcare system,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.396
we know all there is to know
about how to meet patients' needs.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.836
We need to swallow our pride.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.916
We need to go visit
a few medical marijuana dispensaries.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.916
We need to figure out what they're doing.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.516
We need to figure out
why so many patients like Robin

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.716
are leaving our mainstream medical clinics

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.116
and going to these medical
marijuana dispensaries instead.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.236
We need to figure out
what their tricks are,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.516
what their tools are,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.676
and we need to learn from them.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.956
If we do,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.916
and I think we can,
and I absolutely think we have to,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.340
we can guarantee all of our patients
will have a much better experience.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.076
Thank you.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.500
(Applause)
