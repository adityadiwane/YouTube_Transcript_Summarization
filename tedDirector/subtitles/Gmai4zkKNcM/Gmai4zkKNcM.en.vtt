00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:16.298
We are at a remarkable moment in time.

00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:19.234
We face over the next two decades

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.300
two fundamental transformations

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.342
that will determine whether the next 100 years

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:28.527
is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.249
Let me illustrate with an example.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.523
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago

00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:37.549
to teach at the People's University of China.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.485
China was getting serious about market economics

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.824
and about university education,

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:47.315
so they decided to call in the foreign experts.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:48.920
Like most other people,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.736
I moved around Beijing by bicycle.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.930
Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.237
it was a safe and easy way to get around.

00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:58.601
Cycling in Beijing now

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.422
is a completely different prospect.

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:04.565
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.364
The air is dangerously polluted

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:09.976
from the burning of coal and diesel.

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:12.114
When I was there last in the spring,

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.892
there was an advisory for people of my age —

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:17.322
over 65 —

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:20.191
to stay indoors and not move much.

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:22.125
How did this come about?

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.545
It came from the way in which

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.810
Beijing has grown as a city.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.270
It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.446
from 10 million to 20 million.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:33.139
It's become a sprawling urban area

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:37.498
dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:39.321
particularly coal.

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.596
China burns half the world's coal each year,

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:47.510
and that's why, it is a key reason why,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.535
it is the world's largest emitter

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.449
of greenhouse gases.

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:54.563
At the same time, we have to recognize

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:57.747
that in that period China has grown remarkably.

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:00.188
It has become the world's second largest economy.

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:01.657
Hundreds of millions of people

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:03.822
have been lifted out of poverty.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.903
That's really important.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:08.220
But at the same time, the people of China

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.820
are asking the question:

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.400
What's the value of this growth

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.525
if our cities are unlivable?

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:15.837
They've analyzed, diagnosed

00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:19.177
that this is an unsustainable path of growth

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:21.303
and development.

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:23.632
China's planning to scale back coal.

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:29.493
It's looking to build its cities in different ways.

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:31.326
Now, the growth of China

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:35.050
is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.817
in the structure of the world economy.

00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:40.539
Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.429
the poorer countries of the world,

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:46.355
were, notwithstanding being
the vast majority of the people,

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.178
they accounted for only about a third

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:50.170
of the world's output.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.914
Now it's more than half;

00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:54.885
25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:57.990
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.266
as developing.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.864
That's a remarkable change.

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:03.266
It means that most countries around the world,

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.325
rich or poor, are going to be facing

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.305
the two fundamental transformations

00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:10.490
that I want to talk about and highlight.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.503
Now, the first of these transformations

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:15.110
is the basic structural change

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.850
of the economies and societies

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.880
that I've already begun to illustrate

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.390
through the description of Beijing.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.349
Fifty percent now in urban areas.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.960
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.221
Over the next two decades, we'll see

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:34.134
the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,

00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:38.108
and the growth in the economy and in the population

00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:41.090
is putting increasing pressure on our land,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.956
on our water and on our forests.

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:48.241
This is profound structural change.

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:49.816
If we manage it in a negligent

00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:52.435
or a shortsighted way,

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:56.301
we will create waste, pollution, congestion,

00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:59.851
destruction of land and forests.

00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.179
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.902
with my numbers — cities, energy, land —

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.781
if we manage all that badly,

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.862
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods

00:04:09.862 --> 00:04:11.673
of the people around the world

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:14.666
would be poor and damaged.

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.488
And more than that,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.796
the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:23.677
with immense risks to our climate.

00:04:23.677 --> 00:04:25.724
Concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.642
in the atmosphere are already

00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:32.276
higher than they've been for millions of years.

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:35.914
If we go on increasing those concentrations,

00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:39.288
we risk temperatures over the next century or so

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.905
that we have not seen on this planet

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:44.110
for tens of millions of years.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.236
We've been around as Homo sapiens —

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:49.407
that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —

00:04:49.407 --> 00:04:52.210
for perhaps a quarter of a million
years, a quarter of a million.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.441
We risk temperatures we haven't seen

00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:58.180
for tens of millions of years over a century.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.250
That would transform the relationship

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.479
between human beings and the planet.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.130
It would lead to changing deserts,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.320
changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.558
changing sea levels,

00:05:13.558 --> 00:05:16.201
hundreds of millions of people,

00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:19.430
perhaps billions of people who would have to move,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.353
and if we've learned anything from history,

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.665
that means severe and extended conflict.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:25.543
And we couldn't just turn it off.

00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:27.973
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:30.200
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.915
You're in there. You're stuck.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.591
Those are the stakes we're playing for,

00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:36.313
and that's why we have to make
this second transformation,

00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:37.953
the climate transformation,

00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:40.336
and move to a low-carbon economy.

00:05:40.336 --> 00:05:42.714
Now, the first of these transformations

00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:43.795
is going to happen anyway.

00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:45.644
We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:48.462
the economic, or structural, transformation.

00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:50.352
But the second of the transformations,

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:54.466
the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:56.685
Those two transformations face us

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:58.858
in the next two decades.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.071
The next two decades are decisive

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:04.786
for what we have to do.

00:06:04.786 --> 00:06:06.305
Now, the more I've thought about this,

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:08.409
the two transformations coming together,

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:09.956
the more I've come to realize

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.908
that this is an enormous opportunity.

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:15.135
It's an opportunity which we can use

00:06:15.135 --> 00:06:18.532
or it's an opportunity which we can lose.

00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:21.255
And let me explain through those three key areas

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.965
that I've identified: cities, energy and land.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.019
And let me start with cities.

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:30.052
I've already described the problems of Beijing:

00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:32.898
pollution, congestion, waste and so on.

00:06:32.898 --> 00:06:36.588
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:37.847
around the world.

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:40.772
Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,

00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:43.836
you have to think ahead.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.250
The cities that are going to be built —

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.406
and there are many, and many big ones —

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:48.870
we have to think of how to design them

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.221
in a compact way

00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:53.664
so we can save travel time 
and we can save energy.

00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:57.579
The cities that already are 
there, well established,

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:00.650
we have to think about renewal
and investment in them

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.428
so that we can connect ourselves much better

00:07:03.428 --> 00:07:05.820
within those cities, and make it easier,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.411
encourage more people, to live closer to the center.

00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.821
We've got examples building around the world

00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:14.113
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.

00:07:14.113 --> 00:07:18.131
The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia

00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:20.763
is a very important case of how to move around

00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:23.333
safely and quickly in a non-polluting way

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:26.528
in a city: very frequent buses,

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:29.465
strongly protected routes, the same service, really,

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.556
as an underground railway system,

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:33.367
but much, much cheaper

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:35.775
and can be done much more quickly,

00:07:35.775 --> 00:07:37.670
a brilliant idea in many more cities

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.706
around the world that's developing.

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:41.607
Now, some things in cities do take time.

00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:44.660
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.764
Take my hometown, London.

00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:52.052
In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:54.746
and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.

00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:56.096
And it happened all the time.

00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:58.598
For those of you live outside London in the U.K.

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:00.791
will remember it used to be called The Smoke.

00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:02.467
That's the way London was.

00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:04.549
By regulating coal, within a few years

00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:07.637
the problems of smog were rapidly reduced.

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:09.192
I remember the smogs well.

00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:11.915
When the visibility dropped to [less] than

00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:13.908
a few meters,

00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:15.764
they stopped the buses and I had to walk.

00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:17.822
This was the 1950s.

00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:21.720
I had to walk home three miles from school.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.289
Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:27.967
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:31.136
Good decisions can bring good results,

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.501
striking results, quickly.

00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.494
We've seen more: In London, we've
introduced the congestion charge,

00:08:36.494 --> 00:08:39.200
actually quite quickly and effectively,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.820
and we've seen great improvements

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.782
in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:47.902
You can see that the two
transformations I've described,

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.858
the structural and the climate,

00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:52.490
come very much together.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.423
But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,

00:08:55.423 --> 00:08:57.956
and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,

00:08:57.956 --> 00:09:02.492
we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,

00:09:02.492 --> 00:09:05.149
more attractive cities, more productive cities,

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.916
and stronger community in those cities —

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:10.164
public transport, recycling, reusing,

00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:14.213
all sorts of things that bring communities together.

00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:16.070
We can do that, but we have to think,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.350
we have to invest, we have to plan.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.521
Let me turn to energy.

00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.743
Now, energy over the last 25 years

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:25.979
has increased by about 50 percent.

00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:28.596
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.

00:09:28.596 --> 00:09:30.254
Over the next 20 years,

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:34.030
perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.564
We have to invest strongly in energy,

00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:39.838
we have to use it much more efficiently,

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:41.526
and we have to make it clean.

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:42.856
We can see how to do that.

00:09:42.856 --> 00:09:44.760
Take the example of California.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.370
It would be in the top 10 countries in the world

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.913
if it was independent.

00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:52.478
I don't want to start any —

00:09:52.478 --> 00:09:55.976
(Laughter)

00:09:55.976 --> 00:09:57.821
California's a big place.

00:09:57.821 --> 00:09:59.869
(Laughter)

00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:02.610
In the next five or six years,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.324
they will likely move from

00:10:05.324 --> 00:10:07.563
around 20 percent in renewables —

00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:09.320
wind, solar and so on —

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.793
to over 33 percent,

00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:14.232
and that would bring California back

00:10:14.232 --> 00:10:16.765
to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020

00:10:16.765 --> 00:10:18.722
to where they were in 1990,

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:20.466
a period when the economy in California

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:21.898
would more or less have doubled.

00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:23.348
That's a striking achievement.

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:24.831
It shows what can be done.

00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:28.138
Not just California — the 
incoming government of India

00:10:28.138 --> 00:10:31.164
is planning to get solar technology

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:32.536
to light up the homes

00:10:32.536 --> 00:10:34.246
of 400 million people

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:36.311
who don't have electricity in India.

00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:38.791
They've set themselves a target of five years.

00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:42.020
I think they've got a good chance of doing that.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.679
We'll see, but what you're seeing now

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.990
is people moving much more quickly.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.724
Four hundred million, more than the population

00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:50.850
of the United States.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.943
Those are the kinds of ambitions now

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.649
people are setting themselves

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:59.129
in terms of rapidity of change.

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:01.099
Again, you can see

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.880
good decisions can bring quick results,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.913
and those two transformations,
the economy and the structure

00:11:05.913 --> 00:11:07.904
and the climate and the low carbon,

00:11:07.904 --> 00:11:10.447
are intimately intertwined.

00:11:10.447 --> 00:11:12.269
Do the first one well, the structural,

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:14.250
the second one on the climate

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.432
becomes much easier.

00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:19.221
Look at land,

00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:21.809
land and particularly forests.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:24.869
Forests are the hosts to valuable

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:27.398
plant and animal species.

00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:29.746
They hold water in the soil

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:32.664
and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:35.733
fundamental to the tackling of climate change.

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:37.965
But we're losing our forests.

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:40.792
In the last decade, we've lost a forest area

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:42.935
the size of Portugal,

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.398
and much more has been degraded.

00:11:45.398 --> 00:11:47.153
But we're already seeing

00:11:47.153 --> 00:11:49.560
that we can do so much about that.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.597
We can recognize the problem, but we can also

00:11:51.597 --> 00:11:53.711
understand how to tackle it.

00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.366
In Brazil, the rate of deforestation

00:11:56.366 --> 00:11:58.383
has been reduced by 70 percent

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:00.945
over the last 10 years.

00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:03.930
How? By involving local communities,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.751
investing in their agriculture and their economies,

00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:08.851
by monitoring more carefully,

00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:12.496
by enforcing the law more strictly.

00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:14.386
And it's not just stopping deforestation.

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:16.827
That's of course of first and fundamental importance,

00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:20.449
but it's also regrading degraded land,

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:24.849
regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.

00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:28.729
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:31.204
It was desperately poor. In the following years,

00:12:31.204 --> 00:12:32.950
it suffered devastating famines

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.806
and profoundly destructive social conflict.

00:12:36.806 --> 00:12:39.640
Over the last few years, actually more than a few,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.565
Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.

00:12:42.565 --> 00:12:44.455
It has ambitions to be a middle-income country

00:12:44.455 --> 00:12:46.960
15 years from now

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.203
and to be carbon neutral.

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:52.251
Again, I think it's a strong ambition

00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:54.546
but it is a plausible one.

00:12:54.546 --> 00:12:55.957
You're seeing that commitment there.

00:12:55.957 --> 00:12:57.223
You're seeing what can be done.

00:12:57.223 --> 00:12:59.788
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:03.410
It's working in the rehabilitation of land.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.840
In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.257
a wonderful project

00:13:07.257 --> 00:13:09.440
to plant trees on degraded land

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.060
and work with local communities

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.509
on sustainable forest management

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:16.550
has led to big increases in living standards.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.414
So we can see, from Beijing to London,

00:13:20.414 --> 00:13:22.703
from California to India,

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:25.830
from Brazil to Ethiopia,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.439
we do understand

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.644
how to manage those two transformations,

00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:31.573
the structural and the climate.

00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:35.752
We do understand how to manage those well.

00:13:35.752 --> 00:13:38.530
And technology is changing very rapidly.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.937
I don't have to list all those things

00:13:40.937 --> 00:13:42.828
to an audience like this,

00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:45.122
but you can see the electric cars,

00:13:45.122 --> 00:13:48.206
you can see the batteries using new materials.

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:50.601
You can see that we can manage remotely now

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:54.156
our household appliances on our
mobile phones when we're away.

00:13:54.156 --> 00:13:55.963
You can see better insulation.

00:13:55.963 --> 00:13:57.886
And there's much more coming.

00:13:57.886 --> 00:14:00.283
But, and it's a big but,

00:14:00.283 --> 00:14:01.892
the world as a whole

00:14:01.892 --> 00:14:04.670
is moving far too slowly.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.212
We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.

00:14:07.212 --> 00:14:09.923
We're not managing those structural transformations

00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:12.152
as we can.

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:15.391
The depth of understanding of the
immense risks of climate change

00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:18.970
are not there yet.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.101
The depth of understanding

00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:23.586
of the attractiveness of what we can do

00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:27.250
is not there yet.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.748
We need political pressure to build.

00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:34.280
We need leaders to step up.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.779
We can have better growth,

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:41.986
better climate, a better world.

00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:43.798
We can make,

00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:46.578
by managing those two transformations well,

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:50.866
the next 100 years the best of centuries.

00:14:50.866 --> 00:14:52.093
If we make a mess of it,

00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:55.240
we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.713
if we don't manage those transformations properly,

00:14:57.713 --> 00:15:00.604
it will be, the next 100 years

00:15:00.604 --> 00:15:03.335
will be the worst of centuries.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:05.227
That's the major conclusion

00:15:05.227 --> 00:15:08.358
of the report on the economy and climate

00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:12.227
chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,

00:15:12.227 --> 00:15:14.407
and I co-chaired that with him,

00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:16.360
and we handed that report yesterday

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.350
here in New York, in the United Nations Building

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.822
to the Secretary-General of the U.N.,

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:22.088
Ban Ki-moon.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:26.193
We know that we can do this.

00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:29.575
Now, two weeks ago,

00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:32.975
I became a grandfather for the fourth time.

00:15:32.975 --> 00:15:35.107
Our daughter —

00:15:35.107 --> 00:15:45.710
(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.621
Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York

00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:51.626
two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.

00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:56.115
(Applause)

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.838
Two weeks old.

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:07.525
Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye

00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:11.272
and tell them that we understood the issues,

00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:14.590
that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.831
and still we failed to act?

00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:22.310
Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.116
the best of centuries.

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:28.116
(Applause)
