00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:17.383
When I was invited to give this talk 
a couple of months ago,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.893
we discussed a number 
of titles with the organizers,

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:24.308
and a lot of different items were 
kicked around and were discussed.

00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:26.349
But nobody suggested this one,

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.278
and the reason for that
was two months ago,

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:32.190
Ebola was escalating exponentially

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.553
and spreading over wider geographic areas
than we had ever seen,

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:39.822
and the world was terrified, 
concerned and alarmed

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:44.790
by this disease, in a way we've not 
seen in recent history.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.960
But today, I can stand here 
and I can talk to you about beating Ebola

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.651
because of people 
whom you've never heard of,

00:00:54.656 --> 00:01:01.815
people like Peter Clement, a Liberian 
doctor who's working in Lofa County,

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:07.294
a place that many of you have 
never heard of, probably, in Liberia.

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.684
The reason that Lofa County 
is so important

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:12.115
is because about five months ago,

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:16.533
when the epidemic was 
just starting to escalate,

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:21.477
Lofa County was right at the center, 
the epicenter of this epidemic.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.222
At that time, MSF
and the treatment center there,

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:28.097
they were seeing dozens of patients 
every single day,

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:32.345
and these patients, these communities
were becoming more and more terrified

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:36.713
as time went by, with this disease 
and what it was doing to their families,

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:40.329
to their communities, 
to their children, to their relatives.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.092
And so Peter Clement was charged with 
driving that 12-hour-long rough road

00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:49.339
from Monrovia, the capital,
up to Lofa County,

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:53.701
to try and help bring control
to the escalating epidemic there.

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:59.063
And what Peter found when he arrived was
the terror that I just mentioned to you.

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:03.304
So he sat down with the local chiefs, 
and he listened.

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:06.945
And what he heard was heartbreaking.

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:11.279
He heard about the devastation 
and the desperation

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.578
of people affected by this disease.

00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:16.656
He heard the heartbreaking stories

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:20.103
about not just the damage
that Ebola did to people,

00:02:20.103 --> 00:02:23.299
but what it did to families 
and what it did to communities.

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.999
And he listened to the local chiefs there
and what they told him --

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.443
They said, "When our children are sick, 
when our children are dying,

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:36.247
we can't hold them at a time when 
we want to be closest to them.

00:02:36.247 --> 00:02:40.937
When our relatives die, we can't take care
of them as our tradition demands.

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:43.617
We are not allowed to wash 
the bodies to bury them

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.801
the way our communities and 
our rituals demand.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.208
And for this reason, they were
deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:53.995
and the entire epidemic 
was unraveling in front of them.

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.911
People were turning on the healthcare 
workers who had come,

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.265
the heroes who had come to try 
and help save the community,

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:05.184
to help work with the community,
and they were unable to access them.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:10.402
And what happened then was 
Peter explained to the leaders.

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:13.137
The leaders listened. 
They turned the tables.

00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:16.744
And Peter explained what Ebola was.
He explained what the disease was.

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:19.019
He explained what it did
to their communities.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.177
And he explained that Ebola threatened 
everything that made us human.

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:28.563
Ebola means you can't hold your children
the way you would in this situation.

00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:30.873
You can't bury your dead 
the way that you would.

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:35.516
You have to trust these people 
in these space suits to do that for you.

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:38.865
And ladies and gentlemen, what 
happened then was rather extraordinary:

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:42.111
The community and the health workers, 
Peter, they sat down together

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:47.168
and they put together a new plan 
for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.

00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:51.642
And the reason that this is such 
an important story, ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:56.736
is because today, this county, which is 
right at the center of this epidemic

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.563
you've been watching, 
you've been seeing in the newspapers,

00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:03.306
you've been seeing on 
the television screens,

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:09.393
today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks
without seeing a single case of Ebola.

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:16.439
(Applause)

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.872
Now, this doesn't mean that 
the job is done, obviously.

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:23.128
There's still a huge risk
that there will be additional cases there.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:26.392
But what it does teach us 
is that Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:28.049
That's the key thing.

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:29.216
Even on this scale,

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:33.113
even with the rapid kind of growth
that we saw in this environment here,

00:04:33.113 --> 00:04:36.571
we now know Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.562
When communities come together 
with health care workers, work together,

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:43.235
that's when this disease can be stopped.

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:46.885
But how did Ebola end up
in Lofa County in the first place?

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:51.577
Well, for that, we have to go back 
12 months, to the start of this epidemic.

00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:54.828
And as many of you know, 
this virus went undetected,

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:58.803
it evaded detection for three 
or four months when it began.

00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:01.466
That's because this is not 
a disease of West Africa,

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:04.611
it's a disease of Central Africa, 
half a continent away.

00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:06.547
People hadn't seen the disease before;

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:09.156
health workers hadn't seen 
the disease before.

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:11.324
They didn't know what 
they were dealing with,

00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:13.383
and to make it 
even more complicated,

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:17.951
the virus itself was causing a symptom,
a type of a presentation

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.216
that wasn't classical of the disease.

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:24.631
So people didn't even recognize 
the disease, people who knew Ebola.

00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:28.490
For that reason it evaded detection 
for some time,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.660
But contrary to public belief 
sometimes these days,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.175
once the virus was detected, 
there was a rapid surge in of support.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:42.236
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment 
center, as many of you know, in the area.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:45.330
The World Health Organization
and the partners that it works with

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.005
deployed eventually hundreds of people 
over the next two months

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:51.393
to be able to help track the virus.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.424
The problem, ladies and gentlemen,
is by then, this virus,

00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:58.977
well known now as Ebola, 
had spread too far.

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:02.186
It had already outstripped what was 
one of the largest responses

00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:05.995
that had been mounted so far
to an Ebola outbreak.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:08.403
By the middle of the year,
not just Guinea

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:12.366
but now Sierra Leone and Liberia
were also infected.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:17.233
As the virus was spreading geographically,
the numbers were increasing

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:22.289
and at this time, not only were 
hundreds of people infected

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.168
and dying of the disease,

00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:26.907
but as importantly,
the front line responders,

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:29.750
the people who had gone to try and help,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.892
the health care workers, the other 
responders

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.498
were also sick and dying by the dozens.

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.882
The presidents of these countries 
recognized the emergencies.

00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:42.422
They met right around that time, 
they agreed on common action

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:46.640
and they put together an emergency 
joint operation center in Conakry

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.960
to try and work together to finish this
disease and get it stopped,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.712
to implement the strategies
we talked about.

00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:58.199
But what happened then was something 
we had never seen before with Ebola.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.785
What happened then was the virus, 
or someone sick with the virus,

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:05.181
boarded an airplane, 
flew to another country,

00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:09.323
and for the first time,
we saw in another distant country

00:07:09.323 --> 00:07:11.879
the virus pop up again.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:16.286
This time it was in Nigeria,
in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:18.245
21 million people.

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:21.228
Now the virus was in that environment.

00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:24.768
And as you can anticipate, 
there was international alarm,

00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:28.536
international concern on a scale that 
we hadn't seen in recent years

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:30.990
caused by a disease like this.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.630
The World Health Organization immediately 
called together an expert panel,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.251
looked at the situation, 
declared an international emergency.

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:44.346
And in doing so, the expectation would be
that there would be a huge outpouring

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:47.316
of international assistance
to help these countries

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:51.034
which were in so much trouble
and concern at that time.

00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:54.111
But what we saw was 
something very different.

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.869
There was some great response.

00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:02.630
A number of countries came to assist --
many, many NGOs and others, as you know,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.046
but at the same time, the opposite 
happened in many places.

00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:10.161
Alarm escalated, and very soon 
these countries found themselves

00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:14.556
not receiving the support they needed,
but increasingly isolated.

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:19.290
What we saw was commercial airlines
[stopped] flying into these countries

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.881
and people who hadn't even been
exposed to the virus

00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:24.043
were no longer allowed to travel.

00:08:24.043 --> 00:08:27.971
This caused not only problems, obviously, 
for the countries themselves,

00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:30.093
but also for the response.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:33.055
Those organizations that were 
trying to bring people in,

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.261
to try and help them
respond to the outbreak,

00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:37.193
they could not get 
people on airplanes,

00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:40.392
they could not get them into the 
countries to be able to respond.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:42.404
In that situation,
ladies and gentleman,

00:08:42.404 --> 00:08:45.639
a virus like Ebola takes advantage.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:50.577
And what we saw then was something 
also we hadn't seen before.

00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:53.733
Not only did this virus 
continue in the places

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:57.324
where they'd already become infected,
but then it started to escalate

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.692
and we saw the case numbers
that you see here,

00:08:59.692 --> 00:09:02.746
something we'd never seen before
on such a scale,

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:05.783
an exponential increase of Ebola cases

00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:10.024
not just in these countries or the areas 
already infected in these countries

00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:13.883
but also spreading further and 
deeper into these countries.

00:09:13.883 --> 00:09:16.947
Ladies and gentleman,
this was one of the most concerning

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:21.772
international emergencies in public health
we've ever seen.

00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:24.553
And what happened in these countries then,

00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:28.742
many of you saw, again, on the television,
read about in the newspapers,

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:34.102
we saw the health system start to collapse
under the weight of this epidemic.

00:09:34.102 --> 00:09:38.722
We saw the schools begin to close, 
markets no longer started,

00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:42.042
no longer functioned the way 
that they should in these countries.

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:46.161
We saw that misinformation and 
misperceptions started to spread

00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:49.645
even faster through the communities,
which became even more alarmed

00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:51.260
about the situation.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.844
They started to recoil from those people 
that you saw in those space suits,

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.091
as they call them, 
who had come to help them.

00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.118
And then the situation
deteriorated even further.

00:10:00.118 --> 00:10:02.800
The countries had to declare
a state of emergency.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.205
Large populations needed to be quarantined
in some areas, and then riots broke out.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:11.975
It was a very, very terrifying situation.

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:14.834
Around the world,
many people began to ask,

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:18.803
can we ever stop Ebola 
when it starts to spread like this?

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:23.255
And they started to ask, how well 
do we really know this virus?

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:26.740
The reality is we don't know 
Ebola extremely well.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.735
It's a relatively modern disease
in terms of what we know about it.

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:33.020
We've known the disease only for 40 years,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.502
since it first popped up
in Central Africa in 1976.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.582
But despite that, we do know many things:

00:10:39.582 --> 00:10:43.805
We know that this virus
probably survives in a type of a bat.

00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:46.921
We know that it probably enters 
a human population

00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:49.528
when we come in contact with a wild animal

00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:53.086
that has been infected with the virus 
and probably sickened by it.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:56.307
Then we know that the virus
spreads from person to person

00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:58.580
through contaminated body fluids.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.071
And as you've all seen,

00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:03.553
we know the horrific disease
that it then causes in humans,

00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:08.071
where we see this disease cause
severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,

00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:14.541
and then unfortunately, in 70 percent
of the cases or often more, death.

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:19.884
This is a very dangerous,
debilitating, and deadly disease.

00:11:20.344 --> 00:11:24.517
But despite the fact that we've not known
this disease for a particularly long time,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:29.394
and we don't know everything about it,
we do know how to stop this disease.

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:32.608
There are four things
that are critical to stopping Ebola.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:36.922
First and foremost, the communities 
have got to understand this disease,

00:11:36.922 --> 00:11:40.443
they've got to understand 
how it spreads and how to stop it.

00:11:40.443 --> 00:11:44.519
And then we've got to be able to have 
systems that can find every single case,

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.525
every contact of those cases,

00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:50.682
and begin to track the transmission chains
so that you can stop transmission.

00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:54.304
We have to have treatment centers,
specialized Ebola treatment centers,

00:11:54.304 --> 00:11:56.817
where the workers can be protected

00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:01.689
as they try to provide support
to the people who are infected,

00:12:01.689 --> 00:12:04.134
so that they might survive the disease.

00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:06.334
And then for those who do die,

00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:12.192
we have to ensure there is a safe, but at
the same time dignified, burial process,

00:12:12.192 --> 00:12:16.088
so that there is no spread 
at that time as well.

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:21.299
So we do know how to stop Ebola, and these
strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:25.458
The virus was stopped in Nigeria 
by these four strategies

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.562
and the people implementing 
them, obviously.

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:31.584
It was stopped in Senegal, where it had
spread, and also in the other countries

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:35.177
that were affected by this virus, 
in this outbreak.

00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:39.018
So there's no question that 
these strategies actually work.

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:44.326
The big question, ladies and gentlemen,
was whether these strategies could work

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:48.600
on this scale, in this situation,
with so many countries affected

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.206
with the kind of exponential 
growth that you saw.

00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:56.757
That was the big question that we were 
facing just two or three months ago.

00:12:56.757 --> 00:13:00.801
Today we know the answer to that question.

00:13:00.801 --> 00:13:03.779
And we know that answer 
because of the extraordinary work

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:08.546
of an incredible group of NGOs,
of governments, of local leaders,

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:12.932
of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian 
and other organizations

00:13:12.932 --> 00:13:16.850
that came and joined the fight
to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.293
But what had to be done there 
was slightly different.

00:13:20.293 --> 00:13:23.218
These countries took those strategies 
I just showed you;

00:13:23.218 --> 00:13:28.624
the community engagement,
the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:30.548
and they turned them on their head.

00:13:30.548 --> 00:13:33.481
There was so much disease,
they approached it differently.

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:38.912
What they decided to do was they would 
first try and slow down this epidemic

00:13:38.912 --> 00:13:43.899
by rapidly building as many beds as
possible in specialized treatment centers

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:49.203
so that they could prevent the disease
from spreading from those were infected.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.652
They would rapidly build out
many, many burial teams

00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:53.827
so that they could safely
deal with the dead,

00:13:53.827 --> 00:13:56.394
and with that, they would try 
and slow this outbreak

00:13:56.394 --> 00:14:00.613
to see if it could actually then 
be controlled using the classic approach

00:14:00.613 --> 00:14:03.364
of case finding and contact tracing.

00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:06.657
And when I went to West Africa
about three months ago,

00:14:06.657 --> 00:14:09.669
when I was there
what I saw was extraordinary.

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:14.595
I saw presidents opening emergency
operation centers themselves against Ebola

00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:18.363
so that they could personally coordinate 
and oversee and champion

00:14:18.363 --> 00:14:22.450
this surge of international support 
to try and stop this disease.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.001
We saw militaries from within 
those countries and from far beyond

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:28.741
coming in to help build 
Ebola treatment centers

00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:31.991
that could be used to isolate 
those who were sick.

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:36.417
We saw the Red Cross movement working with
its partner agencies on the ground there

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:41.574
to help train the communities so that
they could actually safely bury their dead

00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:44.132
in a dignified manner themselves.

00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:46.933
And we saw the U.N. agencies, 
the World Food Program,

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:48.834
build a tremendous air bridge

00:14:48.834 --> 00:14:52.736
that could get responders to every single
corner of these countries rapidly

00:14:52.736 --> 00:14:56.089
to be able to implement the strategies
that we just talked about.

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:59.434
What we saw, ladies and gentlemen, 
which was probably most impressive,

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:02.451
was this incredible work
by the governments,

00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:05.468
by the leaders in these countries,
with the communities,

00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:08.486
to try to ensure people 
understood this disease,

00:15:08.486 --> 00:15:14.169
understood the extraordinary things they 
would have to do to try and stop Ebola.

00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:16.462
And as a result, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:20.905
we saw something that we did not know
only two or three months earlier,

00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:23.179
whether or not it would be possible.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:26.309
What we saw was 
what you see now in this graph,

00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:29.118
when we took stock on December 1.

00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:32.560
What we saw was we could 
bend that curve, so to speak,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.934
change this exponential growth,

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:39.163
and bring some hope back
to the ability to control this outbreak.

00:15:39.163 --> 00:15:43.217
And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,
there's absolutely no question now

00:15:43.217 --> 00:15:49.018
that we can catch up with this outbreak 
in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.

00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:52.958
The big question, though, 
that many people are asking,

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.941
even when they saw this curve, they said,

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:57.845
"Well, hang on a minute --
that's great you can slow it down,

00:15:57.845 --> 00:15:59.896
but can you actually
drive it down to zero?"

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:03.437
We already answered that question 
back at the beginning of this talk,

00:16:03.437 --> 00:16:07.590
when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.016
We told you the story
how Lofa County got to a situation

00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:13.829
where they have not seen
Ebola for eight weeks.

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:17.205
But there are similar stories from 
the other countries as well.

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:19.451
From Gueckedou in Guinea,

00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:23.959
the first area where the first case was
actually diagnosed.

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:27.373
We've seen very, very few cases
in the last couple of months,

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:31.800
and here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone, 
another area in the epicenter,

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.061
we have not seen the virus
for more than a couple of weeks --

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:38.156
way too early to declare 
victory, obviously,

00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:39.931
but evidence, ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:43.556
not only can the response 
catch up to the disease,

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:46.722
but this disease can be driven to zero.

00:16:46.722 --> 00:16:50.878
The challenge now, of course, 
is doing this on the scale needed

00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:56.244
right across these three countries,
and that is a huge challenge.

00:16:56.244 --> 00:17:00.949
Because when you've been at something
for this long, on this scale,

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:04.949
two other big threats 
come in to join the virus.

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:08.052
The first of those is complacency,

00:17:08.052 --> 00:17:11.475
the risk that as this 
disease curve starts to bend,

00:17:11.475 --> 00:17:14.739
the media look elsewhere, 
the world looks elsewhere.

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:16.371
Complacency always a risk.

00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:20.714
And the other risk, of course, is when
you've been working so hard for so long,

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:24.352
and slept so few hours 
over the past months,

00:17:24.352 --> 00:17:26.590
people are tired, people become fatigued,

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:30.660
and these new risks 
start to creep into the response.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.940
Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today
I've just come back from West Africa.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.640
The people of these countries,
the leaders of these countries,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.136
they are not complacent.

00:17:40.136 --> 00:17:43.879
They want to drive Ebola to zero 
in their countries.

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:47.664
And these people, yes, they're tired, 
but they are not fatigued.

00:17:47.664 --> 00:17:49.869
They have an energy, they have a courage,

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:52.399
they have the strength 
to get this finished.

00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:55.153
What they need, ladies
and gentlemen, at this point,

00:17:55.153 --> 00:17:58.781
is the unwavering support of the 
international community,

00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:00.189
to stand with them,

00:18:00.189 --> 00:18:05.047
to bolster and bring even more support 
at this time, to get the job finished.

00:18:05.047 --> 00:18:10.082
Because finishing Ebola right now 
means turning the tables on this virus,

00:18:10.082 --> 00:18:11.817
and beginning to hunt it.

00:18:11.817 --> 00:18:17.004
Remember, this virus, this whole crisis, 
rather, started with one case,

00:18:17.004 --> 00:18:19.703
and is going to finish with one case.

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:24.027
But it will only finish if those countries
have got enough epidemiologists,

00:18:24.027 --> 00:18:28.644
enough health workers, enough logisticians
and enough other people working with them

00:18:28.644 --> 00:18:32.126
to be able to find every one 
of those cases, track their contacts

00:18:32.126 --> 00:18:36.220
and make sure that this disease 
stops once and for all.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.557
Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.

00:18:39.557 --> 00:18:44.245
Now we need you to take this story out
to tell it to the people who will listen

00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:47.457
and educate them 
on what it means to beat Ebola,

00:18:47.457 --> 00:18:51.189
and more importantly,
we need you to advocate with the people

00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:54.743
who can help us bring the resources we
need to these countries,

00:18:54.743 --> 00:18:56.517
to beat this disease.

00:18:56.517 --> 00:19:00.699
There are a lot of people out there 
who will survive and will thrive,

00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:04.101
in part because of what you do 
to help us beat Ebola.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.587
Thank you.

00:19:05.587 --> 00:19:09.474
(Applause)
