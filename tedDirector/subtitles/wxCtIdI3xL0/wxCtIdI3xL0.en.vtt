00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:14.276
Well, you know, sometimes

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:17.258
the most important things come
in the smallest packages.

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.847
I am going to try to convince you,
in the 15 minutes I have,

00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:25.100
that microbes have a lot to say
about questions such as,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.998
"Are we alone?"

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:32.223
and they can tell us more about
not only life in our solar system

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:34.100
but also maybe beyond,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.397
and this is why I am tracking them down
in the most impossible places on Earth,

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:41.766
in extreme environments where conditions

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.450
are really pushing them
to the brink of survival.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.704
Actually, sometimes me too,
when I'm trying to follow them too close.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:49.521
But here's the thing:

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:55.134
We are the only advanced civilization
in the solar system,

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:58.878
but that doesn't mean that there is
no microbial life nearby.

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:02.663
In fact, the planets
and moons you see here

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:06.633
could host life -- all of them --
and we know that,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.482
and it's a strong possibility.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:14.135
And if we were going to find life
on those moons and planets,

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.151
then we would answer questions such as,

00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:19.287
are we alone in the solar system?

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.256
Where are we coming from?

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:24.233
Do we have family in the neighborhood?

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.157
Is there life beyond our solar system?

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:32.244
And we can ask all those questions
because there has been a revolution

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:36.520
in our understanding
of what a habitable planet is,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.860
and today, a habitable planet is a planet

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.193
that has a zone where
water can stay stable,

00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:47.922
but to me this is a horizontal
definition of habitability,

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:50.197
because it involves a distance to a star,

00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:53.169
but there is another
dimension to habitability,

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.350
and this is a vertical dimension.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.527
Think of it as

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:06.210
conditions in the subsurface of a planet
where you are very far away from a sun,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.353
but you still have water,
energy, nutrients,

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:11.304
which for some of them means food,

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.207
and a protection.

00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:15.251
And when you look at the Earth,

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:19.796
very far away from any sunlight,
deep in the ocean,

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.665
you have life thriving

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:25.676
and it uses only chemistry
for life processes.

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:31.326
So when you think of it 
at that point, all walls collapse.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:33.600
You have no limitations, basically.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.160
And if you have been looking
at the headlines lately,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.120
then you will see that we have
discovered a subsurface ocean

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.989
on Europa, on Ganymede,
on Enceladus, on Titan,

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.923
and now we are finding a geyser
and hot springs on Enceladus,

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:49.978
Our solar system is turning
into a giant spa.

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.864
For anybody who has gone to a spa
knows how much microbes like that, right?

00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:55.582
(Laughter)

00:02:55.582 --> 00:02:59.111
So at that point, think also about Mars.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:02.478
There is no life possible
at the surface of Mars today,

00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:05.729
but it might still be hiding underground.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:11.339
So, we have been making progress
in our understanding of habitability,

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.111
but we also have been making progress
in our understanding

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.687
of what the signatures
of life are on Earth.

00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:20.543
And you can have what we call
organic molecules,

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:22.470
and these are the bricks of life,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350
and you can have fossils,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.253
and you can minerals, biominerals,

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.643
which is due to the reaction
between bacteria and rocks,

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.777
and of course you can have
gases in the atmosphere.

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:35.983
And when you look at those
tiny green algae

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.934
on the right of the slide here,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:41.450
they are the direct descendants
of those who have been pumping oxygen

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.843
a billion years ago
in the atmosphere of the Earth.

00:03:43.843 --> 00:03:46.465
When they did that, they poisoned
90 percent of the life

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:47.987
at the surface of the Earth,

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:51.190
but they are the reason why
you are breathing this air today.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.925
But as much as our understanding grows
of all of these things,

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.851
there is one question
we still cannot answer,

00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:03.126
and this is, where are we coming from?

00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:04.844
And you know, it's getting worse,

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.886
because we won't be able
to find the physical evidence

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:10.440
of where we are coming from
on this planet,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.130
and the reason being is that anything that
is older than four billion years is gone.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.754
All record is gone,

00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:21.632
erased by plate tectonics and erosion.

00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:25.184
This is what I call the Earth's
biological horizon.

00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:28.667
Beyond this horizon we don't know
where we are coming from.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.593
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:35.308
And we might be able to find
evidence of our own origin

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:38.419
in the most unlikely place,
and this place in Mars.

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.420
How is this possible?

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.201
Well clearly at the beginning
of the solar system,

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.169
Mars and the Earth were bombarded
by giant asteroids and comets,

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.327
and there were ejecta
from these impacts all over the place.

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:56.187
Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks
at each other for a very long time.

00:04:56.187 --> 00:04:58.230
Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.181
Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:05.359
So clearly, those two planets may have
been seeded by the same material.

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:09.283
So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting
there on the surface and waiting for us.

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:18.190
But that also means that we can go to Mars
and try to find traces of our own origin.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.442
Mars may hold that secret for us.

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:23.150
This is why Mars is so special to us.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.160
But for that to happen,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.544
Mars needed to be habitable
at the time when conditions were right.

00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:32.400
So was Mars habitable?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.254
We have a number of missions
telling us exactly the same thing today.

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:39.992
At the time when life
appeared on the Earth,

00:05:39.992 --> 00:05:44.830
Mars did have an ocean,
it had volcanoes, it had lakes,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.673
and it had deltas like the beautiful
picture you see here.

00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:51.460
This picture was sent by the Curiosity 
rover only a few weeks ago.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.142
It shows the remnants of a delta,
and this picture tells us something:

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:57.096
water was abundant

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:59.757
and stayed founting at the surface
for a very long time.

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:01.568
This is good news for life.

00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:04.990
Life chemistry takes a long time
to actually happen.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.507
So this is extremely good news,

00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:10.127
but does that mean that if we go there,
life will be easy to find on Mars?

00:06:10.127 --> 00:06:12.010
Not necessarily.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.861
Here's what happened:

00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:17.230
At the time when life exploded
at the surface of the Earth,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.369
then everything went south for Mars,

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:20.901
literally.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.472
The atmosphere was
stripped away by solar winds,

00:06:24.472 --> 00:06:26.775
Mars lost its magnetosphere,

00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:31.187
and then cosmic rays and U.V.
bombarded the surface

00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:35.410
and water escaped to space
and went underground.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.501
So if we want to be able to understand,

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:43.430
if we want to be able to find those traces
of the signatures of life

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.644
at the surface of Mars, if they are there,

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:48.831
we need to understand what was
the impact of each of these events

00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.484
on the preservation of its record.

00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:57.314
Only then will we be able
to know where those signatures are hiding,

00:06:57.314 --> 00:07:00.997
and only then will we be able
to send our rover to the right places

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:04.146
where we can sample those rocks
that may be telling us something

00:07:04.146 --> 00:07:06.862
really important about who we are,

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:10.972
or, if not, maybe telling us
that somewhere, independently,

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.828
life has appeared on another planet.

00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:16.336
So to do that, it's easy.

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:19.894
You only need to go back
3.5 billion years ago

00:07:19.894 --> 00:07:22.285
in the past of a planet.

00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:24.909
We just need a time machine.

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.103
Easy, right?

00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:28.673
Well, actually, it is.

00:07:28.673 --> 00:07:30.574
Look around you -- that's planet Earth.

00:07:30.574 --> 00:07:32.618
This is our time machine.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:36.788
Geologists are using it
to go back in the past of our own planet.

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:38.971
I am using it a little bit differently.

00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:41.966
I use planet Earth to go
in very extreme environments

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.868
where conditions were similar
to those of Mars

00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:46.865
at the time when the climate changed,

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:49.745
and there I'm trying 
to understand what happened.

00:07:49.745 --> 00:07:51.439
What are the signatures of life?

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:54.272
What is left? How are we going to find it?

00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:57.276
So for one moment now
I'm going to take you with me

00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:00.130
on a trip into that time machine.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.865
And now, what you see here,
we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:11.594
but in fact we are less than a billion
years after the Earth and Mars formed.

00:08:11.594 --> 00:08:15.285
The Earth and Mars will have looked
pretty much exactly like that --

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:18.796
volcanoes everywhere,
evaporating lakes everywhere,

00:08:18.796 --> 00:08:22.103
minerals, hot springs,

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:25.934
and then you see those mounds
on the shore of those lakes?

00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:29.394
Those are built by the descendants
of the first organisms

00:08:29.394 --> 00:08:32.496
that gave us the first fossil on Earth.

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:36.555
But if we want to understand what's 
going on, we need to go a little further.

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:38.470
And the other thing about those sites

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.946
is that exactly like on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:46.463
the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:49.678
But we need to go back to that time
when everything changed on Mars,

00:08:49.678 --> 00:08:51.761
and to do that, we need to go higher.

00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:53.858
Why is that?

00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:55.215
Because when you go higher,

00:08:55.215 --> 00:08:58.337
the atmosphere is getting thinner,
it's getting more unstable,

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:03.648
the temperature is getting cooler,
and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.

00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:04.457
Basically,

00:09:04.457 --> 00:09:09.191
you are getting to those conditions
on Mars when everything changed.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.837
So I was not promising anything about
a leisurely trip on the time machine.

00:09:16.837 --> 00:09:19.371
You are not going to be sitting
in that time machine.

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:22.399
You have to haul 1,000 pounds
of equipment to the summit

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:26.184
of this 20,000-foot volcano
in the Andes here.

00:09:26.184 --> 00:09:28.784
That's about 6,000 meters.

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:32.407
And you also have to sleep
on 42-degree slopes

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:35.518
and really hope that there won't
be any earthquake that night.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:40.464
But when we get to the summit,
we actually find the lake we came for.

00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:45.126
At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.245
as those on Mars
three and a half billion years ago.

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:51.170
And now we have to change our voyage

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.890
into an inner voyage inside that lake,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.541
and to do that, we have to remove
our mountain gear

00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:01.847
and actually don suits and go for it.

00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:06.452
But at the time we enter that lake,
at the very moment we enter that lake,

00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:08.380
we are stepping back

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.561
three and a half billion years
in the past of another planet,

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:15.661
and then we are going to get
the answer came for.

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:19.633
Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:22.953
Everything you see in this picture
is a living organism.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:26.446
Maybe not so the diver,
but everything else.

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.853
But this picture is very deceiving.

00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:33.523
Life is abundant in those lakes,

00:10:33.523 --> 00:10:37.630
but like in many places on Earth 
right now and due to climate change,

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.324
there is a huge loss in biodiversity.

00:10:40.744 --> 00:10:43.740
In the samples that we took back home,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.556
36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes
were composed of three species,

00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:53.375
and those three species are the ones
that have survived so far.

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:56.162
Here's another lake,
right next to the first one.

00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:59.830
The red color you see here
is not due to minerals.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.151
It's actually due to the presence
of a tiny algae.

00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:07.660
In this region, the U.V. radiation
is really nasty.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.129
Anywhere on Earth, 11
is considered to be extreme.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:15.160
During U.V. storms there,
the U.V. Index reaches 43.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.976
SPF 30 is not going to do anything 
to you over there,

00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:23.342
and the water is so
transparent in those lakes

00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:26.675
that the algae has
nowhere to hide, really,

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:28.965
and so they are developing
their own sunscreen,

00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:30.749
and this is the red color you see.

00:11:30.749 --> 00:11:33.310
But they can adapt only so far,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.788
and then when all the water
is gone from the surface,

00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:38.388
microbes have only one solution left:

00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:40.246
They go underground.

00:11:40.246 --> 00:11:43.171
And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,

00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:46.391
well, they are actually
living inside rocks

00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:49.585
and they are using the protection
of the translucence of the rocks

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:51.382
to get the good part of the U.V.

00:11:51.382 --> 00:11:55.126
and discard the part that could
actually damage their DNA.

00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:57.401
And this is why we are taking our rover

00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.977
to train them to search 
for life on Mars in these areas,

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:04.714
because if there was life on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:12:04.714 --> 00:12:09.074
it had to use the same strategy
to actually protect itself.

00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:12.242
Now, it is pretty obvious

00:12:12.242 --> 00:12:15.770
that going to extreme environments
is helping us very much

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.761
for the exploration of Mars 
and to prepare missions.

00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:24.100
So far, it has helped us to understand
the geology of Mars.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.221
It has helped to understand the past
climate of Mars and its evolution,

00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:31.208
but also its habitability potential.

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:36.747
Our most recent rover on Mars
has discovered traces of organics.

00:12:36.747 --> 00:12:39.706
Yeah, there are organics
at the surface of Mars.

00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:43.607
And it also discovered traces of methane.

00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:46.152
And we don't know yet
if the methane in question

00:12:46.152 --> 00:12:49.990
is really from geology or biology.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.859
Regardless, what we know is
that because of the discovery,

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:58.100
the hypothesis that there is still
life present on Mars today

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.455
remains a viable one.

00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:05.652
So by now, I think I have convinced you
that Mars is very special to us,

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:08.628
but it would be a mistake to think
that Mars is the only place

00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:13.574
in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.

00:13:14.434 --> 00:13:18.352
And the reason is because
Mars and the Earth

00:13:18.352 --> 00:13:21.143
could have a common root
to their tree of life,

00:13:21.143 --> 00:13:25.290
but when you go beyond Mars,
it's not that easy.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.900
Celestial mechanics 
is not making it so easy

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.315
for an exchange
of material between planets,

00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:34.355
and so if we were to discover
life on those planets,

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.212
it would be different from us.

00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:38.050
It would be a different type of life.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.903
But in the end, it might be just us,

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.899
it might be us and Mars,

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.382
or it can be many trees of life
in the solar system.

00:13:46.382 --> 00:13:50.110
I don't know the answer yet,
but I can tell you something:

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.542
No matter what the result is,
no matter what that magic number is,

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.553
it is going to give us a standard

00:13:56.553 --> 00:14:01.081
by which we are going to be able 
to measure the life potential,

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.191
abundance and diversity
beyond our own solar system.

00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:06.751
And this can be achieved
by our generation.

00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:10.614
This can be our legacy,
but only if we dare to explore.

00:14:11.654 --> 00:14:13.740
Now, finally,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.708
if somebody tells you that looking 
for alien microbes is not cool

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:21.138
because you cannot have
a philosophical conversation with them,

00:14:21.138 --> 00:14:27.014
let me show you why and how
you can tell them they're wrong.

00:14:27.804 --> 00:14:30.572
Well, organic material
is going to tell you

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:36.231
about environment, about complexity
and about diversity.

00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:42.350
DNA, or any information carrier,
is going to tell you about adaptation,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.371
about evolution, about survival,
about planetary changes

00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:50.219
and about the transfer of information.

00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:53.307
All together, they are telling us

00:14:53.307 --> 00:14:57.208
what started as a microbial pathway,

00:14:57.208 --> 00:15:00.226
and why what started
as a microbial pathway

00:15:00.226 --> 00:15:03.686
sometimes ends up as a civilization

00:15:03.686 --> 00:15:07.308
or sometimes ends up as a dead end.

00:15:07.308 --> 00:15:10.724
Look at the solar system,
and look at the Earth.

00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:13.531
On Earth, there are many
intelligent species,

00:15:13.531 --> 00:15:16.898
but only one has achieved technology.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:20.195
Right here in the journey
of our own solar system,

00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:22.934
there is a very, very powerful message

00:15:22.934 --> 00:15:28.320
that says here's how we should look 
for alien life, small and big.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.618
So yeah, microbes are talking
and we are listening,

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:33.337
and they are taking us,

00:15:33.337 --> 00:15:35.891
one planet at a time
and one moon at a time,

00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:38.770
towards their big brothers out there.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.486
And they are telling us about diversity,

00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:44.110
they are telling us about
abundance of life,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.150
and they are telling us
how this life has survived thus far

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.192
to reach civilization,

00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:56.174
intelligence, technology
and, indeed, philosophy.

00:15:56.174 --> 00:15:57.879
Thank you.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:01.115
(Applause)
