00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.967
I am no designer, nope, no way.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.783
My dad was,

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.375
which is kind of an interesting way to grow up.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.550
I had to figure out what it is my dad did

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.350
and why it was important.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.511
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.481
you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.944
whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:43.894
or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:46.287
or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:51.806
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:54.414
It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:57.777
Every object should be about something, John.

00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:59.215
It should imagine a user.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:04.182
It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:09.423
Good design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:12.078
That's what he said.

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:15.999
Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.999
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.555
He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:30.593
I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.965
And design was in everything my dad did.

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:36.122
He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:38.818
and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.

00:01:38.818 --> 00:01:40.546
And I would ask him every once in a while,

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.457
"Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.610
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.907
And he said, "No, never, John, never.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.634
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:53.319
You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.316
Show everyone what you intend," is what he said.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:01.605
"Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.714
It's where we all belong."

00:02:03.714 --> 00:02:07.139
All of us? Designers?

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:12.073
Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:13.738
The song is just a given.

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:16.226
It's how you cover it that matters.

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:18.322
Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:21.225
It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?

00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.250
The original tune? It's a little scary.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.914
"Ooh, what happened to that dude?

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:29.025
He can't walk. Anybody know the story?

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.931
Anybody?"

00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:36.218
I don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:40.068
All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:42.010
I was in a poorly designed automobile

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.931
that hit a poorly designed guardrail

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.514
on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:53.307
and plummeted down a 200-foot embankment

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.514
and killed two people in the car.

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:59.993
But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.

00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:05.129
My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.532
Think about it. Now, in design terms,

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:10.530
a wheelchair is a very difficult object.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.698
It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.489
and it projects that message, that story, so strongly

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.748
that it almost blots out anything else.

00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:23.226
I roll swiftly through an airport, right?

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:27.210
And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.409
The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.578
And for decades, I'm going,

00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:38.058
why does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.

00:03:38.058 --> 00:03:43.217
So I would roll, I'd make no eye contact -- just kinda frown, right?

00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:48.649
Or I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.526
Or I'd make eye contact with everyone --

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:53.018
that was really creepy; that didn't work at all.

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:54.931
(Laughter)

00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:58.786
You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked.

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:02.770
Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.110
my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.234
"Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels -- you gotta get 'em!"

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:16.347
And I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:18.913
that just wouldn't do at all."

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:20.858
And of course, they immediately concluded,

00:04:20.858 --> 00:04:26.025
"Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.

00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:30.503
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:35.465
I went, "Wait a minute, all right, right -- I'll get the wheels." Purely out of protest,

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:40.383
I got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and --

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:43.911
check this out. Could I have my special light cue please?

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:45.433
(Laughter)

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:48.364
Look at that!

00:04:48.364 --> 00:04:50.829
Now ... look at, look at this! Look at this!

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:54.276
So what you are looking at here

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:57.363
has completely changed my life,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.340
I mean totally changed my life.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.212
Instead of blank stares and awkwardness,

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:06.696
now it is pointing and smiling!

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:10.764
People going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:13.364
I mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say,

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.500
"Can I have a ride?"

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.375
(Laughter)

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:19.892
And of course there's the occasional person --

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:21.708
usually a middle-aged male who will say,

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:23.349
"Oh, those wheels are great!

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.639
I guess they're for safety, right?"

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.988
(Laughter)

00:05:27.988 --> 00:05:33.956
No! They're not for safety.

00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:35.836
No, no, no, no, no.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.613
What's the difference here,

00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:39.420
the wheelchair with no lights

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.150
and the wheelchair with lights?

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.932
The difference is intent.

00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:48.589
That's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:54.501
I chose to change the situation -- I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?

00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:58.876
Intent changes the picture completely.

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:00.693
I choose to enhance

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.636
this rolling experience

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:06.340
with a simple design element.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.548
Acting with intent.

00:06:08.548 --> 00:06:10.764
It conveys authorship.

00:06:10.764 --> 00:06:13.844
It suggests that someone is driving.

00:06:13.844 --> 00:06:16.852
It's reassuring; people are drawn to it.

00:06:16.852 --> 00:06:20.364
Someone making the experience their own.

00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:22.604
Covering the tragic tune

00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:25.500
with something different,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.709
something radically different.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.756
People respond to that.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:33.548
Now it seems simple, but actually I think

00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:35.773
in our society and culture in general,

00:06:35.773 --> 00:06:37.836
we have a huge problem with intent.

00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:41.196
Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:45.212
It's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:46.948
in Olso, Norway last year,

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.308
dozens and dozens of young people --

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.020
if he intended to do that,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.604
he's a vicious criminal. We punish him.

00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:56.973
Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.

00:06:56.973 --> 00:07:01.324
But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,

00:07:01.324 --> 00:07:06.308
if he was motivated by some random mental illness,

00:07:06.308 --> 00:07:08.754
he's in a completely different category.

00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.541
We may put him away for life, but

00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:12.580
we watch him clinically.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.029
It's a completely different domain.

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:18.501
As an intentional murderer,

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:21.540
Anders Breivik is merely evil.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.725
But as a dysfunctional,

00:07:23.725 --> 00:07:25.973
as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:27.932
he's something much more complicated.

00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:29.692
He's the breath of some 

00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:33.092
primitive, ancient chaos.

00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:35.076
He's the random state of nature

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.606
we emerged from.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.876
He's something very, very different.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:42.613
It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.

00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:44.932
It's what we're supposed to do somehow.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.660
We're supposed to act with intent.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.116
We're supposed to do things by design.

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:54.956
Intent is a marker for civilization.

00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:57.548
Now here's an example a little closer to home:

00:07:57.548 --> 00:07:59.924
My family is all about intent.

00:07:59.924 --> 00:08:03.132
You can probably tell there are two sets of twins,

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:07.380
the result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.015
due to some physical limitations I won't go into.

00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:13.068
Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF,

00:08:13.068 --> 00:08:16.072
is about as intentional as agriculture.

00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:18.228
Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience.

00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:21.172
In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:25.620
for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.902
I met the dude. He's a great guy.

00:08:27.902 --> 00:08:32.844
He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:35.140
all of the animals that he'd worked with,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.639
all the different animals.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.771
Probes he designed,

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.772
and in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.

00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:45.542
He would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.780
(Laughter)

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.452
But anyway, so when my wife and I decided

00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:57.501
to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids, after all --

00:08:57.501 --> 00:08:59.492
with a little different technology

00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:02.372
that I won't explain in too much detail here --

00:09:02.372 --> 00:09:06.630
my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.206
"No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"

00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:12.766
"John, John, I looked at your chart.

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:15.023
From your sperm tests we can

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:17.031
confidently say that

00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:19.753
you're basically a form of birth control."

00:09:19.753 --> 00:09:23.031
Well!

00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:26.623
(Laughter)

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:29.998
What a liberating thought! Yes!

00:09:29.998 --> 00:09:33.063
And after a couple very liberating weekends,

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:34.503
my wife and I,

00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:38.391
utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology

00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:40.975
that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday

00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:43.006
but I won't get into it now,

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:47.758
we noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:51.418
I wasn't exactly a form of birth control.

00:09:51.418 --> 00:09:54.998
Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed.

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:56.543
I mean, did a designer come up with that?

00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:58.775
No, I don't think a designer did come up with that.

00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:00.990
In fact, maybe that's the problem.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.671
And so, little Ajax was born.

00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:05.940
He's like our other children,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.718
but the experience is completely different.

00:10:07.718 --> 00:10:11.958
It's something like my accident, right?

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.233
He came out of nowhere.

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:14.839
But we all had to change,

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:17.520
but not just react to the given;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.079
we bend to this new experience with intent.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:26.151
We're five now. Five.

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:30.063
Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:34.295
Hey, the name Ajax -- you can't get much more intentional than that, right?

00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:38.535
We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.

00:10:38.535 --> 00:10:40.368
(Laughter)

00:10:40.368 --> 00:10:44.267
But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.

00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:48.905
I did love some great designs as I was growing up:

00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:53.272
The HP 35S calculator -- God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.

00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:56.722
Man, I love that thing.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:57.945
I could afford that.

00:10:57.945 --> 00:11:02.584
Other designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.

00:11:02.584 --> 00:11:06.049
In school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;

00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:08.368
I studied useless things like the Classics,

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.185
but there were some lessons even there --

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:13.449
this guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:16.872
He designed a state in "The Republic,"

00:11:16.872 --> 00:11:18.363
a design never implemented.

00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:20.048
Listen to one of the design features

00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:23.072
of Plato's Government 4.0:

00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:27.632
"The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern

00:11:27.632 --> 00:11:30.568
is always the best and most quietly governed,

00:11:30.568 --> 00:11:34.640
and the State in which they are most eager, the worst."

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.584
Well, got that wrong, didn't we?

00:11:37.584 --> 00:11:41.881
But look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.

00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:45.336
But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:48.856
It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design,

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:52.573
common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy

00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:54.813
that emerged in the Classical period.

00:11:54.813 --> 00:11:56.246
What was going on then?

00:11:56.246 --> 00:11:58.382
They were trying to answer the question of

00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:03.348
what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:07.789
As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:12.213
a confrontation with random, brutal nature,

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:15.797
they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about.

00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:19.924
All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.

00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:22.639
Human life needed a reason.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.661
Reality itself needed a designer.

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.053
The given was replaced

00:12:28.053 --> 00:12:30.677
by various aspects of intent,

00:12:30.677 --> 00:12:33.261
by various designs,

00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:35.541
by various gods.

00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:39.485
Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.

00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:42.645
Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.

00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:48.525
Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.

00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:51.805
This young discipline called design, I think,

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:55.072
is in fact the emerging ethos

00:12:55.072 --> 00:12:57.990
formulating and then answering a very new question:

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.589
What shall we do now

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:03.332
in the face of the chaos that we have created?

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:05.236
What shall we do?

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:07.702
How shall we inscribe intent

00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:10.005
on all the objects we create,

00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:11.981
on all the circumstances we create,

00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:14.588
on all the places we change?

00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:18.716
The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.

00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:23.085
That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.

00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:25.621
And we can't just imitate the past. No.

00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:28.455
That won't do.

00:13:28.455 --> 00:13:30.230
That won't do at all.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.237
Here's my favorite design moment:

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:36.645
In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,

00:13:36.645 --> 00:13:38.933
I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:43.077
the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,

00:13:43.077 --> 00:13:45.077
who raped and pillaged that country.

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:47.645
There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:51.126
The place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,

00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:54.997
and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa

00:13:54.997 --> 00:13:57.020
to report on the rioting and the looting.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.806
People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:05.501
Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.

00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:09.015
In the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:12.765
and I was completely invisible. Completely.

00:14:12.765 --> 00:14:15.535
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.

00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:21.717
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.

00:14:21.717 --> 00:14:23.957
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.

00:14:23.957 --> 00:14:30.252
I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.

00:14:30.252 --> 00:14:35.349
And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,

00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:39.069
in this metal and wood and leather

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:44.094
pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,

00:14:44.094 --> 00:14:46.558
and he pedals up to me as fast as he can.

00:14:46.558 --> 00:14:48.333
He goes, "Hey, mister! Mister!"

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:50.630
And I looked at him --

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.214
he didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.

00:14:54.214 --> 00:15:00.085
We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.

00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:03.510
And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.750
he was full of pride over his design.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.599
I wish I could show you that contraption.

00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:10.726
His smile, our glow

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:13.237
as we talked a universal language

00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:15.949
of design,

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.766
invisible to the chaos around us.

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:22.822
His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:26.120
My machine: American-made, confident, sleek.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.342
He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat

00:15:30.342 --> 00:15:32.258
he had made in his chariot

00:15:32.258 --> 00:15:36.685
and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.

00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:40.669
Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!

00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:43.414
He would have loved those! Oh yeah.

00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:45.006
He would have understood those;

00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:48.474
a chariot of pure intent -- think about it --

00:15:48.474 --> 00:15:51.086
in a city out of control.

00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:54.134
Design blew it all away for a moment.

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:58.278
We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.

00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:00.697
He went back to the streets of Kinshasa;

00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:06.679
I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.741
And I pose this question.

00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:13.294
An object imbued with intent --

00:16:13.294 --> 00:16:14.958
it has power,

00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.358
it's treasure, we're drawn to it.

00:16:18.358 --> 00:16:20.990
An object devoid of intent --

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.502
it's random, it's imitative,

00:16:23.502 --> 00:16:27.182
it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.

00:16:27.182 --> 00:16:31.933
This is what we must demand of our lives,

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:35.758
of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:

00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:38.854
living with intent.

00:16:38.854 --> 00:16:40.958
And I have to say

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:45.989
that on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:51.694
And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.

00:16:51.694 --> 00:16:56.629
Thirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,

00:16:56.629 --> 00:17:00.785
a 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma

00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:02.582
to ask a nurse a question,

00:17:02.582 --> 00:17:05.062
but the nurse was already there with an answer.

00:17:05.062 --> 00:17:08.765
"You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back.

00:17:08.765 --> 00:17:10.406
You'll never walk again."

00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:16.022
I said, "I know all that -- what day is it?"

00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:23.046
You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:26.695
and I knew that 1976 was a leap year.

00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:31.405
"Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"

00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:33.398
And she looked at me and said,

00:17:33.398 --> 00:17:35.973
"It's March 1st."

00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:38.454
And I went, "Oh my God.

00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:40.990
I've got some catching up to do!"

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.662
And from that moment, I knew

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:46.910
the given was that accident;

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.598
I had no option but to make up

00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:53.654
this new life without walking.

00:17:53.654 --> 00:17:57.462
Intent -- a life with intent --

00:17:57.462 --> 00:17:59.286
lived by design,

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.902
covering the original

00:18:00.902 --> 00:18:02.462
with something better.

00:18:02.462 --> 00:18:07.542
It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:10.884
To get back to this,

00:18:10.884 --> 00:18:13.020
to get back to design,

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.421
and as my daddy suggested a long time ago,

00:18:16.421 --> 00:18:19.708
"Make the song your own, John.

00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:24.798
Show everybody what you intend."

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.989
Daddy,

00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:42.937
this one's for you.

00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:47.717
(Music)

00:18:47.717 --> 00:18:51.925
♫ Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner ♫

00:18:51.925 --> 00:18:54.245
♫ but he was another man. ♫

00:18:54.245 --> 00:19:00.430
♫ Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona to attend a California bash. ♫

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.373
♫ Get back, get back, ♫

00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:06.653
♫ get back to where you once belonged. ♫

00:19:06.653 --> 00:19:09.517
♫ Get back, get back, ♫

00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:18.980
♫ get back to where you once belonged. ♫

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:28.240
(Applause)
