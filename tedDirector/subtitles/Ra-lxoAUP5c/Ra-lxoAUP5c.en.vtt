00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My journey to become a polar specialist,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
photographing, specializing
in the polar regions,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
began when I was four years old,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
when my family moved from southern Canada

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
to Northern Baffin Island,
up by Greenland.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
There we lived with the Inuit

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
in the tiny Inuit community
of 200 Inuit people,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
where [we] were one
of three non-Inuit families.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And in this community,
we didn't have a television;

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
we didn't have computers,
obviously, radio.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
We didn't even have a telephone.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
All of my time was spent outside

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
with the Inuit, playing.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
The snow and the ice were my sandbox,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and the Inuit were my teachers.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And that's where I became

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
truly obsessed with this polar realm.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And I knew someday that
I was going to do something

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that had to do with trying
to share news about it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and protect it.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I'd like to share with you,
for just two minutes only,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
some images, a cross-section of my work,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
to the beautiful music
by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever."

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
I don't know why National Geographic
has done this, they've never done this before,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
but they're allowing me
to show you a few images

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
from a coverage that I've just completed
that is not published yet.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
National Geographic doesn't do this,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
so I'm very excited to be able
to share this with you.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And what these images are --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
you'll see them at the start of the slide show --
there's only about four images --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
but it's of a little bear
that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
It's pure white,
but it's not a polar bear.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It's a spirit bear,
or a Kermode bear.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
There are only 200 of these bears left.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
They're more rare than the panda bear.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I sat there on the river
for two months without seeing one.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I thought, my career's over.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
I proposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
What in the heck was I thinking?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So I had two months to sit there

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and figure out different ways
of what I was going to do in my next life,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
after I was a photographer,
because they were going to fire me.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Because National Geographic is a magazine;
they remind us all the time:

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
they publish pictures, not excuses.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.260
(Laughter)

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And after two months of sitting there --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
one day, thinking that it was all over,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
this incredible big white male came down,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
right beside me, three feet away from me,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
and he went down and grabbed a fish
and went off in the forest and ate it.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And then I spent the entire day
living my childhood dream

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
of walking around with this bear
through the forest.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
He went through this old-growth forest

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and sat up beside this 400-year-old
culturally modified tree and went to sleep.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And I actually got to sleep
within three feet of him,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
just in the forest, and photograph him.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So I'm very excited to be able
to show you those images

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and a cross-section of my work
that I've done on the polar regions.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Please enjoy.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260

(Applause)

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much.
The show's not over.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We're inundated with news all the time

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that the sea ice is disappearing

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and it's at its lowest level.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And in fact, scientists
were originally saying

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
sea ice is going to disappear
in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Now they're saying
the sea ice in the Arctic,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
the summertime extent is going to be gone
in the next four to 10 years.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And what does that mean?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
After a while of reading this in the news,
it just becomes news.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
You glaze over with it.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And what I'm trying to do
with my work is put faces to this.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And I want people to understand
and get the concept

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that, if we lose ice,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Projections are that we could
lose polar bears, they could become extinct

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
in the next 50 to 100 years.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And there's no better, sexier,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
more beautiful,
charismatic megafauna species

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
for me to hang my campaign on.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Polar bears are amazing hunters.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
This was a bear I sat with
for a while on the shores.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
There was no ice around.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
But this glacier caved into the water
and a seal got on it.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And this bear swam out to that seal --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
800 lb. bearded seal --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
grabbed it, swam back and ate it.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And he was so full,
he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that, as I approached him --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
about 20 feet away --
to get this picture,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
his only defense was to keep eating more seal.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And as he ate, he was so full --

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
he probably had about
200 lbs of meat in his belly --

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and as he ate inside
one side of his mouth,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
he was regurgitating
out the other side of his mouth.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So as long as these bears
have any bit of ice they will survive,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
but it's the ice that's disappearing.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
We're finding more and more
dead bears in the Arctic.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
When I worked on polar bears
as a biologist 20 years ago,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
we never found dead bears.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And in the last four or five years,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
we're finding dead bears
popping up all over the place.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
floating in the open ocean
where the ice has melted out.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
I found a couple in Norway last year.
We're seeing them on the ice.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
These bears are already showing signs

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
of the stress of disappearing ice.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Here's a mother and her two year-old cub

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
were traveling on a ship a hundred miles
offshore in the middle of nowhere,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and they're riding
on this big piece of glacier ice,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
which is great for them;
they're safe at this point.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
They're not going to die of hypothermia.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
They're going to get to land.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
But unfortunately,
95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
are also receding right now

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to the point that the ice
is ending up on land

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and not injecting any ice
back into the ecosystem.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
These ringed seals,
these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
These little, fat dumplings,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
150-pound bundles of blubber

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
are the mainstay of the polar bear.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And they're not like
the harbor seals that you have here.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
These ringed seals also
live out their entire life cycle

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
associated and connected to sea ice.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
They give birth inside the ice,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and they feed on the Arctic cod
that live under the ice.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And here's a picture of sick ice.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
This is a piece of multi-year ice
that's 12 years old.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And what scientists didn't predict
is that, as this ice melts,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
these big pockets
of black water are forming

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and they're grabbing the sun's energy

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and accelerating the melting process.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And here we are diving
in the Beaufort Sea.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
The visibility's 600 ft.;
we're on our safety lines;

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
the ice is moving all over the place.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
I wish I could spend half
an hour telling you

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
about how we almost died on this dive.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But what's important in this picture
is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
that big chunk of ice up in the corner.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
In that one single piece of ice,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
you have 300 species of microorganisms.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And in the spring,
when the sun returns to the ice,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
it forms the phytoplankton,
grows under that ice,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and then you get the
zooplankton feeding on all that life.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So really what the ice does

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is it acts like a garden.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
It acts like the soil in a garden.
It's an inverted garden.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Losing that ice is like
losing the soil in a garden.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Here's me in my office.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
I hope you appreciate yours.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
This is after an hour under the ice.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
I can't feel my hands;
I can't feel my feet.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And I've come up, and all I wanted
to do was get out of the water.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
After an hour in these conditions,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
it's so extreme that, when I go down,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
almost every dive I vomit into my regulator

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
because my body can't deal
with the stress of the cold on my head.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And so I'm just so happy
that the dive is over.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
I get to hand my camera to my assistant,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
and I'm looking up at him,
and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo."

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Which means, "Take my camera."

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And he thinks I'm saying,
"Take my picture."

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So we had this little
communication breakdown.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
(Laughter)

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
But it's worth it.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I'm going to show you pictures
of beluga whales, bowhead whales,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
and narwhals, and polar bears,
and leopard seals today,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
but this picture right here means more
to me than any other I've ever made.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
I dropped down in this ice hole,
just through that hole that you just saw,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
and I looked up under
the underside of the ice,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and I was dizzy;
I thought I had vertigo.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
I got very nervous --
no rope, no safety line,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
the whole world is moving around me --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
and I thought, "I'm in trouble."

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
But what happened
is that the entire underside

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
was full of these billions
of amphipods and copepods

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
moving around and feeding
on the underside of the ice,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
giving birth and living out
their entire life cycle.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
This is the foundation of the whole food chain
in the Arctic, right here.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And when you have low 
productivity in this, in ice,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
the productivity in copepods go down.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
This is a bowhead whale.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Supposedly, science is stating

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that it could be the oldest living animal
on earth right now.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
This very whale right here
could be over 250 years old.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
This whale could have been born

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
around the start
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
It could have survived
150 years of whaling.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And now its biggest threat
is the disappearance of ice in the North

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
because of the lives
that we're leading in the South.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Narwhals, these majestic narwhals

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
with their eight-foot long ivory tusks,
don't have to be here;

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
they could be out on the open water.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
But they're forcing themselves
to come up in these tiny little ice holes

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
where they can breathe, catch a breath,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
because right under that ice
are all the swarms of cod.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And the cod are there

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
because they are feeding
on all the copepods and amphipods.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Alright, my favorite part.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
When I'm on my deathbed,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
I'm going to remember
one story more than any other.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Even though that spirit bear
moment was powerful,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
I don't think I'll ever have
another experience

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
like I did with these leopard seals.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,
have had a bad reputation.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
They've got that wryly smile
on their mouth.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
They've got those black sinister eyes

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and those spots on their body.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
They look positively prehistoric
and a bit scary.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
And tragically in [2003],

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
a scientist was taken down
and drowned,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
and she was being consumed
by a leopard seal.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And people were like, "We knew
they were vicious. We knew they were."

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
And so people love to form their opinions.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And that's when I got a story idea:

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I want to go to Antarctica,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
get in the water with as many
leopard seals as I possibly can

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and give them a fair shake --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
find out if they really are these vicious
animals, or if they're misunderstood.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
So this is that story.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Oh, and they also happen
to eat Happy Feet.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
(Laughter)

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
As a species, as humans,
we like to say penguins are really cute,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
therefore, leopard seals eat them,
so leopard seals are ugly and bad.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
It doesn't work that way.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
The penguin doesn't know it's cute,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and the leopard seal doesn't
know it's kind of big and monstrous.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
This is just the food chain unfolding.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
They're also big.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
They're not these little harbor seals.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
And they're also curiously aggressive.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
floating in these icy waters,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and a leopard seal comes up
and bites the pontoon.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and get to go home and tell
the stories of how they got attacked.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
All the leopard seal was doing --

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
it's just biting a balloon.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean --
it doesn't have hands --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
it's going to take a little bite,
the boat pops, and off they go.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Laughter)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
So after five days of crossing
the Drake Passage --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
isn't that beautiful --

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
after five days of crossing
the Drake Passage,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
we have finally arrived at Antarctica.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.260
His name is Goran Ehlme
from Sweden -- Goran.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And he has a lot of experience
with leopard seals. I have never seen one.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
So we come around the cove
in our little Zodiac boat,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and there's this monstrous leopard seal.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And even in his voice, he goes,
"That's a bloody big seal, ya."

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
(Laughter)

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And this seal is taking
this penguin by the head,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and it's flipping it back and forth.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And what it's trying to do
is turn that penguin inside-out,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
so it can eat the meat off the bones,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and then it goes off and gets another one.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And so this leopard seal
grabbed another penguin,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
came under the boat, the Zodiac,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
starting hitting the hull of the boat.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
And we're trying to not fall in the water.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And we sit down,
and that's when Goran said to me,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
"This is a good seal, ya.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
It's time for you to get in the water."

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
(Laughter)

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And I looked at Goran,
and I said to him, "Forget that."

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.260
But I think I probably used a different word
starting with the letter "F."

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
But he was right.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
He scolded me out,
and said, "This is why we're here.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
And you purposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And now you've got to deliver.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And you can't publish excuses."

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
So I had such dry mouth --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
probably not as bad as now --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.260
but I had such, such dry mouth.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And my legs were just trembling.
I couldn't feel my legs.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
I put my flippers on.
I could barely part my lips.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
I put my snorkel in my mouth,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and I rolled over the side
of the Zodiac into the water.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And this was the first thing she did.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
She came racing up to me,
engulfed my whole camera --

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and her teeth are up here
and down here --

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,
had given me amazing advice.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.260
He said, "If you get scared,
you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
(Laughter)

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
So that's all I had to work
with at that point.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
But I just started to shoot these pictures.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
So she did this threat display
for a few minutes,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
and then the most amazing thing happened --
she totally relaxed.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
She went off, she got a penguin.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
She stopped about 10 feet away from me,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
and she sat there with this penguin,
the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
The penguin swims toward me, takes off.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
She grabs another one.
She does this over and over.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And it dawned on me
that she's trying to feed me a penguin.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.260
Why else would she release
these penguins at me?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And after she did this four or five times,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
she swam by me
with this dejected look on her face.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
You don't want to be too anthropomorphic,
but I swear that she looked at me

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
like, "This useless predator's
going to starve in my ocean."

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:10.260
(Laughter)

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So realizing I couldn't catch
swimming penguins,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
she'd get these other penguins
and bring them slowly towards me,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
bobbing like this,
and she'd let them go.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
This didn't work.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
I was laughing so hard and so emotional

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
that my mask was flooding,
because I was crying underwater,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
just because it was so amazing.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And so that didn't work.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
So then she'd get another penguin
and try this ballet-like sexy display

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And she would sort of bring them
over to me and offer it to me.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
This went on for four days.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
This just didn't happen a couple of times.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And then so she realized
I couldn't catch live ones,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
so she brought me dead penguins.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
(Laughter)

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Now I've got four or five penguins
floating around my head,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and I'm just sitting there shooting away.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
And she would often stop
and have this dejected look on her face

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
like, "Are you for real?"

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Because she can't believe
I can't eat this penguin.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Because in her world,
you're either breeding or you're eating --

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
and I'm not breeding, so ...

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
(Laughter)

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
And then that wasn't enough;
she started to flip penguins onto my head.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
She was trying to force-feed me.
She's pushing me around.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
She's trying to force-feed my camera,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
which is every photographer's dream.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And she would get frustrated;
she'd blow bubbles in my face.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
She would, I think, let me know
that I was going to starve.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
But yet she didn't stop.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
She would not stop
trying to feed me penguins.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And on the last day with this female

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
where I thought I had pushed her too far,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
I got nervous because she came up to me,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
she rolled over on her back,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and she did this deep, guttural
jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
And I thought, she's about to bite.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
She's about to let me know
she's too frustrated with me.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
What had happened
was another seal had snuck in behind me,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and she did that to threat display.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
She chased that big seal away,
went and got its penguin

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and brought it to me.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
(Laughter)

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
That wasn't the only seal
I got in the water with.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
I got in the water
with 30 other leopard seals,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and I never once had a scary encounter.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
They are the most remarkable animals
I've ever worked with,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
and the same with polar bears.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
And just like the polar bears,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
these animals depend
on an icy environment.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
I get emotional. Sorry.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
It's a story that lives deep in my heart,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
and I'm proud to share this with you.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
And I'm so passionate about it.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Anybody want to come with me
to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
We've got to get the story out now.
Thank you very much.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
(Applause)

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Thank you.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.260
(Applause)

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Thank you.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:42.260
(Applause)

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Thank you. Thanks very much.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
(Applause)

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Thank you.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
(Applause)
