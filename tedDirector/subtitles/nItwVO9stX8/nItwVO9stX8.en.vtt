00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Both myself and my brother

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
belong to the under 30 demographic,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
which Pat said makes 70 percent,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
but according to our statistics

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
it makes 60 percent of the region's population.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Qatar is no exception to the region.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It's a very young nation led by young people.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and the iPods,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and for me the abaya,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Now this is not a religious garment,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
nor is it a religious statement.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
that we choose to wear.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Now I remember a few years ago,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
president of Qatar University --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
who, by the way, is a woman --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
he asked her whether she thought

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Her answer was quite the contrary.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Instead, she felt more free,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
more free because she could wear whatever she wanted

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
under the abaya.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
(Laughter)

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Not that you do; I'm just saying.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
(Laughter)

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
My point is here, people have a choice --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
just like the Indian lady could wear her sari

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
We are changing our culture from within,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
but at the same time

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
we are reconnecting with our traditions.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
We know that modernization is happening.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
But at the same time

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It's important for us to grow organically.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
And we continuously make the conscious decision

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to reach that balance.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
In fact, research has shown

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that the more the world is flat,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
if I use Tom Friedman's analogy,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
or global,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the more and more people are wanting to be different.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And for us young people,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
they're looking to become individuals

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and find their differences amongst themselves.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
of globalizing the local

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and localizing the global.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
We don't want to be all the same,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
but we want to respect each other and understand each other.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And therefore tradition becomes more important,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
not less important.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Life necessitates a universal world,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
however, we believe in the security

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
of having a local identity.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And this is what the leaders of this region

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
are trying to do.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
We're trying to be part of this global village,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
but at the same time we're revising ourselves

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
through our cultural institutions and cultural development.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I'm a representation of that phenomenon.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And I think a lot of people in this room,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
they are in the same position.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
We're continuously trying to straddle

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
different worlds, different cultures

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and trying to meet the challenges

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of a different expectation

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
from ourselves and from others.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So I want to ask a question:

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
What should culture in the 21st century look like?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
In a time where the world is becoming personalized,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
everything has its own personal identity,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
how should we perceive ourselves

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and how should we perceive others?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
How does that impact our desert culture?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
opened in Qatar in 2008.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
but I also understand

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
that this has to be done organically.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
in order to develop new cultural institutions,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
but what I think is more important

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
is that we are very fortunate

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
to have visionary leaders

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
who understand that this can't happen from outside,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
it has to come from within.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And guess what?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
who are leading these cultural initiatives

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
happen to be women.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Is it because it's a soft option;

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
we have nothing else to do?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
No, I don't think so.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
I think that women in this part of the world

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
realize that culture is an important component

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to connect people

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
both locally and regionally.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's a natural component

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
for bringing people together, discussing ideas --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
in the same way we're doing here at TED.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
We're here, we're part of a community,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
sharing out ideas and discussing them.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Art becomes a very important part

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
of our national identity.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
The existential and social and political impact

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
an artist has

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
on his nation's development of cultural identity

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
is very important.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
You know, art and culture is big business.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Ask me.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
of Sotheby's and Christie's.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
They make a lot of money.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So I think women in our society

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
are becoming leaders,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
because they realize

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
that for their future generations,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
it's very important

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to maintain our cultural identities.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Why else do Greeks demand the return

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
of the Elgin Marbles?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And why is there an uproar

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
when a private collector tries to sell his collection

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
to a foreign museum?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Why does it take me months on end

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
to get an export license from London or New York

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
in order to get pieces into my country?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
who's a very important artist for us

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
will be talking to you.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Instead, she tries to engage

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
in a very important dialogue

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
about her culture, nation and heritage.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
She does that through important visual forms

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
of photography and film.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
through an organic process from within.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
We don't want to have what there is in the West.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
We don't want their collections.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
create an open dialogue

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
so that we share our ideas

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and share yours with us.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
In a few days,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
We have done extensive research

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
and Arabs who are not Muslims --

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
but we make sure that they are represented

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
in this new institution.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
This institution is government-backed

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and it has been the case

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
for the past three decades.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
We will open the museum in a few days,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and come and join us.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
(Laughter)

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Some of you might have heard

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
but I doubt a lot of people know

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
that this artist worked in Picasso's studio

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
in Paris in the 1930s.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
For me it was a new discovery.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And I think with time, in the years to come

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
our Legers and our Cezannes.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
We do have artists,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Now visual expression is just one form

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
of culture integration.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
We have realized that recently

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
more and more people

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
are using the means of YouTube and social networking

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to express their stories, share their photos

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and tell their own stories through their own voices.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
In a similar way,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
we have created the Doha Film Institute.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
to teach people about film and filmmaking.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Today I am proud to say

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
we have trained and educated

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
over 66 Qatari women filmmakers

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
to edit, tell their own stories

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
in their own voices.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.260
(Applause)

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
that has proven to show

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
in telling a big picture.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And this is one of our filmmakers' products.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Who are you playing?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Play by yourself then.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Useless.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Thank you. Thank you!

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:58.260
(Applause)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
SM: Going back to straddling between East and West,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
here in Doha.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
It attracted 42,000 people,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and we showcased 51 films.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
is not an imported festival,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
but rather an important festival

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
between the cities of New York and Doha.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
It's important for two things.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
First, it allows us to showcase

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
our Arab filmmakers and voices

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
New York City.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
At the same time, we are inviting them

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to come and explore our part of the world.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and realizing we're just as different

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and just the same as each other.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Now over and over again,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
people have said, "Let's build bridges,"

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and frankly, I want to do more than that.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
I would like break the walls of ignorance

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
between East and West --

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
no, not the soft option that we have discussed before,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
but rather the soft power

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
We should not underestimate it.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
"Know thyself,"

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
that we are traveling.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
but I know that me as an individual

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and we as a nation

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
welcome this community

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
of ideas worth spreading.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
This is a very interesting journey.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
I welcome you on board

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
for us to engage and discuss new ideas

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
of how to bring people together

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
through cultural initiatives and discussions.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Applause)
