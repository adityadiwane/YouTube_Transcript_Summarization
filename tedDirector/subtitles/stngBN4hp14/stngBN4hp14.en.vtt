00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My subject today is learning.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Ready?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
When does learning begin?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Now as you ponder that question,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
or kindergarten,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
when children are learning how to walk and talk

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and use a fork.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
which asserts that the most important years for learning

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
are the earliest ones.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And so your answer to my question would be:

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Learning begins at birth.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Well today I want to present to you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
an idea that may be surprising

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and may even seem implausible,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
but which is supported by the latest evidence

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
from psychology and biology.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
happens before we're born,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
while we're still in the womb.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Now I'm a science reporter.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I write books and magazine articles.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And I'm also a mother.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And those two roles came together for me

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
in a book that I wrote called "Origins."

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
"Origins" is a report from the front lines

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
of an exciting new field

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
called fetal origins.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
that emerged just about two decades ago,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and it's based on the theory

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that our health and well-being throughout our lives

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is crucially affected

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
by the nine months we spend in the womb.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
I was myself pregnant

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
while I was doing the research for the book.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And one of the most fascinating insights

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
I took from this work

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is that we're all learning about the world

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
even before we enter it.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
When we hold our babies for the first time,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we might imagine that they're clean slates,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
unmarked by life,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
when in fact, they've already been shaped by us

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and by the particular world we live in.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that scientists are discovering

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
about what fetuses learn

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
while they're still in their mothers' bellies.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
First of all,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Because sounds from the outside world

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
the voices fetuses hear,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
starting around the fourth month of gestation,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
are muted and muffled.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
One researcher says

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
in the old "Peanuts" cartoon.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
But the pregnant woman's own voice

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
reverberates through her body,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
reaching the fetus much more readily.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And because the fetus is with her all the time,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
it hears her voice a lot.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and it prefers listening to her voice

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
over anyone else's.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
How can we know this?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Newborn babies can't do much,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
but one thing they're really good at is sucking.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Researchers take advantage of this fact

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
by rigging up two rubber nipples,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
so that if a baby sucks on one,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
it hears a recording of its mother's voice

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
on a pair of headphones,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and if it sucks on the other nipple,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.260
it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Babies quickly show their preference

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
by choosing the first one.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Scientists also take advantage of the fact

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
that babies will slow down their sucking

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
when something interests them

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and resume their fast sucking

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
when they get bored.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
This is how researchers discovered

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
that, after women repeatedly read aloud

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.260
a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
their newborn babies recognized that passage

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
when they hear it outside the womb.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
My favorite experiment of this kind

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
is the one that showed that the babies

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
of women who watched a certain soap opera

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
every day during pregnancy

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
recognized the theme song of that show

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
once they were born.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So fetuses are even learning

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
about the particular language that's spoken

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
in the world that they'll be born into.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
A study published last year

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
found that from birth, from the moment of birth,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
babies cry in the accent

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
of their mother's native language.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
French babies cry on a rising note

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
while German babies end on a falling note,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
imitating the melodic contours

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of those languages.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Now why would this kind of fetal learning

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
be useful?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
From the moment of birth,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
the baby responds most to the voice

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
of the person who is most likely to care for it --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
its mother.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
It even makes its cries

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
sound like the mother's language,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
which may further endear the baby to the mother,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and which may give the baby a head start

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
in the critical task

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
of learning how to understand and speak

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
its native language.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
But it's not just sounds

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that fetuses are learning about in utero.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It's also tastes and smells.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
By seven months of gestation,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
are functioning.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
find their way into the amniotic fluid,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
which is continuously swallowed

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
by the fetus.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
once they're out in the world.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
during their third trimester of pregnancy,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
while another group of pregnant women

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
drank only water.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Six months later, the women's infants

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
ate more carrot-flavored cereal,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and from the looks of it,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
they seemed to enjoy it more.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
A sort of French version of this experiment

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
was carried out in Dijon, France

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
where researchers found

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
that mothers who consumed food and drink

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.260
flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
showed a preference for anise

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
on their first day of life,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and again, when they were tested later,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
on their fourth day of life.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
What this means

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
about what is safe and good to eat.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Fetuses are also being taught

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
about the particular culture that they'll be joining

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
through one of culture's most powerful expressions,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
which is food.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
of their culture's cuisine

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
even before birth.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
But before I get to that,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I want to address something that you may be wondering about.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
The notion of fetal learning

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
like playing Mozart through headphones

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
placed on a pregnant belly.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But actually, the nine-month-long process

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.260
is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
the air she breathes,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
the food and drink she consumes,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
the chemicals she's exposed to,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
even the emotions she feels --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
are shared in some fashion with her fetus.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
They make up a mix of influences

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
as individual and idiosyncratic

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
as the woman herself.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
The fetus incorporates these offerings

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
into its own body,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
makes them part of its flesh and blood.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And often it does something more.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
It treats these maternal contributions

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
as information,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
as what I like to call biological postcards

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
from the world outside.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So what a fetus is learning about in utero

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
is not Mozart's "Magic Flute"

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Will it be born into a world of abundance

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
or scarcity?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Will it be safe and protected,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
or will it face constant dangers and threats?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Will it live a long, fruitful life

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
or a short, harried one?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
provide important clues to prevailing conditions

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
like a finger lifted to the wind.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
The resulting tuning and tweaking

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
of a fetus' brain and other organs

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
are part of what give us humans

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
our enormous flexibility,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
our ability to thrive

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
in a huge variety of environments,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
from the country to the city,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
from the tundra to the desert.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
about how mothers teach their children about the world

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
even before they're born.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
In the autumn of 1944,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
the darkest days of World War II,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
German troops blockaded Western Holland,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
turning away all shipments of food.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
The opening of the Nazi's siege

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.260
so cold the water in the canals froze solid.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Soon food became scarce,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
a quarter of what they consumed before the war.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
By the beginning of May,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
the nation's carefully rationed food reserve

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
was completely exhausted.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
The specter of mass starvation loomed.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And then on May 5th, 1945,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
the siege came to a sudden end

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
when Holland was liberated

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
by the Allies.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
killed some 10,000 people

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and weakened thousands more.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
But there was another population that was affected --

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
the 40,000 fetuses

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
in utero during the siege.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
were immediately apparent

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
in higher rates of stillbirths,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
birth defects, low birth weights

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
and infant mortality.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
Decades after the "Hunger Winter,"

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
researchers documented

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.260
that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
have more obesity, more diabetes

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and more heart disease in later life

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
seems to have changed their bodies

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
in myriad ways.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
They have higher blood pressure,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
poorer cholesterol profiles

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and reduced glucose tolerance --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
a precursor of diabetes.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Why would undernutrition in the womb

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
result in disease later?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
One explanation

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
When food is scarce,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and away from other organs

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
like the heart and liver.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
but the bill comes due later on in life

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
when those other organs, deprived early on,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
become more susceptible to disease.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
But that may not be all that's going on.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
It seems that fetuses are taking cues

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
from the intrauterine environment

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and tailoring their physiology accordingly.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
They're preparing themselves

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
for the kind of world they will encounter

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
on the other side of the womb.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
The fetus adjusts its metabolism

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and other physiological processes

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And the basis of the fetus' prediction

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
is what its mother eats.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
The meals a pregnant woman consumes

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
constitute a kind of story,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
a fairy tale of abundance

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
or a grim chronicle of deprivation.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
This story imparts information

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
that the fetus uses

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
to organize its body and its systems --

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
an adaptation to prevailing circumstances

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
that facilitates its future survival.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Faced with severely limited resources,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
will, in fact, have a better chance

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
of living to adulthood.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
The real trouble comes

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
when fetuses are led

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
to expect a world of scarcity

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and are born instead into a world of plenty.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And their higher rates of obesity,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
diabetes and heart disease

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
are the result.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
of the post-war Western diet.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
The world they had learned about while in utero

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
was not the same

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
as the world into which they were born.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Here's another story.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.260
At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
there were tens of thousands of people

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
in the vicinity of the World Trade Center

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
in New York --

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
commuters spilling off trains,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
1,700 of these people were pregnant women.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
many of these women experienced the same horrors

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
inflicted on other survivors of the disaster --

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
the overwhelming chaos and confusion,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
the rolling clouds

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.260
of potentially toxic dust and debris,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
the heart-pounding fear for their lives.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
About a year after 9/11,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
researchers examined a group of women

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
who were pregnant

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
In the babies of those women

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
following their ordeal,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
researchers discovered a biological marker

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
of susceptibility to PTSD --

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
an effect that was most pronounced

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
in their third trimester.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
In other words,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
had passed on a vulnerability to the condition

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
to their children while they were still in utero.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
Now consider this:

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
What looks like pathology to us

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
may actually be a useful adaptation

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
in some circumstances.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
In a particularly dangerous environment,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
the characteristic manifestations of PTSD --

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
a quick-trigger response to danger --

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
could save someone's life.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.260
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
is still speculative,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
but I find it rather poignant.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
It would mean that, even before birth,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
mothers are warning their children

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
that it's a wild world out there,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
telling them, "Be careful."

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Let me be clear.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
for what happens during pregnancy.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
It's about discovering how best to promote

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
the health and well-being of the next generation.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
That important effort must include a focus

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
on what fetuses learn

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
during the nine months they spend in the womb.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Learning is one of life's most essential activities,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and it begins much earlier

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
than we ever imagined.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
Thank you.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:40.260
(Applause)
