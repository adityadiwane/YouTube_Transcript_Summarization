00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
The best minds in the best institutions

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
generally get it wrong.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.260
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And it's clearly in the area of finance.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
With institutions established to think about the future,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Over 20,000 economists

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
couldn't see what was happening.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Globalization is getting more complex.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And this change is getting more rapid.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
The future will be more unpredictable.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Urbanization, integration,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
coming together, leads to a new renaissance.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
It did this a thousand years ago.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
for innovation, for development.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
But there is an underbelly.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
those that are left out, those that feel angry,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
those that are not participating. Globalization

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
has not been inclusive.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
The second Achilles' heel is complexity --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
in what you can get for the same price

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
in computing by 2030.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It will continue.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Our computers, our systems will be as primitive

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
as the Apollo's are for today.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Our mobile phones are more powerful than

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So what will this do?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
It will create huge opportunities in technology.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Miniaturization as well.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in our brains, and in the air.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
not least in the area of medicine.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
from an embryonic stem cell.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We can develop any part of the body.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
able to replicate parts of the body.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
But the question is, "Who will have it?"

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The other major development is going to be

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
in the area of what can happen in genetics.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.260
The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
something which goes three times faster,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
lasts for three times longer, we could produce,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.260
as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
using about the same amount of food.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
But will this only be available for the super rich,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Will only those that are able to afford it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
be able to be this super race of the future?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.260
(Laughter)

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So the big question for us is,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
"How do we manage this technological change?"

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
How do we ensure that it creates

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
a more inclusive technology,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
a technology which means

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
that not only as we grow older,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the populations of the future?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
will be moving from population pyramids

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
to what we might term population coffins.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
There is unlikely to be a pension

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
or a retirement age in 2030.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
type of new pyramids

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
that will take place in China and in many other countries.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
So forget about retirements if you're young.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Of course, migration will become even more important.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
The war on talent, the need to attract people

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
at all skill ranges,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
to push us around in our wheelchairs,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
The employment in the rich countries

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
will go down from about 800

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
to about 700 million of these people.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
This would imply a massive leap in migration.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
of migration, will be turned on their head,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
as we search for people to help us sort out

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
our pensions and our economies in the future.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And then, the systemic risks.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
We understand that these will become much more virulent,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
that what we see today

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is this interweaving of societies, of systems,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
The collapse in biodiversity,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
climate change, pandemics, financial crises:

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
these will be the currency that we will think about.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And so a new awareness will have to arise,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
in a new way, and come together as a community

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to manage systemic risk.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
It's going to require innovation.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
could also be its downfall.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
or it could be our worst.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And of course we need to worry about the individuals,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
particularly the individuals that feel that they've

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
been left out in one way or another.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
will have the capacity, by 2030,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
How do we think about complex systems in new ways?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
That will be the challenge of the scholars,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
collectively, through collective wisdom.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
We know, and I know from my own experience,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
that amazing things can happen,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
when individuals and societies come together

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
to change their future.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
I left South Africa, and 15 years later,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
after thinking I would never go back,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
This was a miracle. We can create miracles,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
collectively, in our lifetime.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It is vital that we do so.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that the ideas that we think about

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Thank you. (Applause)
