00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
We utter about six metaphors a minute.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Metaphorical thinking is essential

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
to how we understand ourselves and others,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
how we communicate, learn, discover

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and invent.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.260
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Now, to assist me in explaining this,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
the reigning king of the metaphorians,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
a man whose contributions to the field

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
are so great that he himself

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
has become a metaphor.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I am, of course, referring to none other

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
than Elvis Presley.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.260
(Laughter)

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
It's also a great example of how

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
whenever we deal with anything abstract --

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.260
ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we inevitably resort to metaphor.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260
In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
She is not she, but a buttercup.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And love is not love, but being all shook up.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
as the process of giving the thing

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
a name that belongs to something else.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
This is the mathematics of metaphor.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And fortunately it's very simple.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
X equals Y.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
(Laughter)

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
This formula works wherever metaphor is present.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Juliet is the sun.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.260
a name that belongs to something else, the sun.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
we give it a whole network of analogies too.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
in this case the sun,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
with what we know about its target, Juliet.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.260
than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So, how do we make and understand metaphors?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
This might look familiar.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
The first step is pattern recognition.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Look at this image. What do you see?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Three wayward Pac-Men,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and three pointy brackets are actually present.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
What we see, however,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
are two overlapping triangles.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
it is the creation of patterns.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Second step, conceptual synesthesia.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
in another sense organ as well,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
such as colored hearing.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
People with colored hearing

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
actually see colors when they hear the sounds

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
of words or letters.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
We all have synesthetic abilities.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
What you have to do is identify which of these shapes

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.260
(Laughter)

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
If you are like 98 percent of other people,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Can we do a quick show of hands?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Does that correspond?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Why do we do that?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Because we instinctively find, or create,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
a pattern between the round shape

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and the round sound of Bouba,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Silence is sweet.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Neckties are loud.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Sexually attractive people are hot.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
in which we understand one concept

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
in the context of another.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Third step is cognitive dissonance.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
This is the Stroop test.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
What you need to do here is identify

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
as quickly as possible

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
the color of the ink in which these words are printed.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
You can take the test now.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
If you're like most people, you will experience

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
a moment of cognitive dissonance

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
when the name of the color

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
is printed in a differently colored ink.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.260
The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
the literally false sentences.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
They took longer to reject metaphors as false

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
than they did to reject literally false sentences.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Why? Because we cannot ignore

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
the metaphorical meaning of words either.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
One of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Now, unless you're a prison guard,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Sadly, it's metaphorically true.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
to identify it as literally false.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
Metaphor matters because

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
it's around us every day, all the time.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Agent metaphors describe price movements

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
as the deliberate action of a living thing,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.260
as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Object metaphors describe price movements

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
as non-living things,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
as in, "The Dow fell like a brick."

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Researchers asked a group of people

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
to read a clutch of market commentaries,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and then predict the next day's price trend.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Those exposed to agent metaphors

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
had higher expectations that price trends would continue.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And they had those expectations because

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
agent metaphors imply the deliberate action

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
of a living thing pursuing a goal.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
If, for example, house prices

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
are routinely described as climbing and climbing,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
higher and higher, people might naturally assume

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
that that rise is unstoppable.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
They may feel confident, say,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
That's a hypothetical example of course.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
But this is how metaphor misleads.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
by activating analogies.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
A group of students was told that a small democratic country

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And they had to make a decision.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
What should they do?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
They were each then given one of three

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Each of which was designed to trigger

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
a different historical analogy:

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
World War II, Vietnam,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and the third was historically neutral.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Those exposed to the World War II scenario

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
made more interventionist recommendations

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
than the others.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
we cannot ignore the analogies

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260
that are triggered by metaphor.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
we compare what we know with what we don't know.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And the only way to find out about the latter

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
He famously used thought experiments,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
which are essentially elaborate analogies,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
By bringing together what we know

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and what we don't know through analogy,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
metaphorical thinking strikes the spark

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that ignites discovery.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
But you just have to look at the words around you

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and you'll find it.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
as "fossil poetry."

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
But before it was fossil poetry

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
language was fossil metaphor.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And these fossils still breathe.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
"Cogito ergo sum."

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
But there is a better translation.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
The Latin word "cogito"

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
So, the original meaning of "cogito"

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
is to shake together.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.260
is "I shake things up, therefore I am."

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
(Laughter)

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Metaphor shakes things up,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.260
giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The mind is a plastic snow dome,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
the most beautiful, most interesting,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and most itself, when, as Elvis put it,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
it's all shook up.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And metaphor keeps the mind shaking,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Thank you very much.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
(Applause)
