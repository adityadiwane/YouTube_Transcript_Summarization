00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.329
Before I get to bulk
of what I have to say,

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.913
I feel compelled just to mention
a couple of things about myself.

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:24.613
I am not some mystical,

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.475
spiritual sort of person.

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:29.516
I'm a science writer.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.811
I studied physics in college.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.797
I used to be a science
correspondent for NPR.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:37.427
OK, that said:

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.611
in the course of working
on a story for NPR,

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:43.913
I got some advice from an astronomer

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:46.044
that challenged my outlook,

00:00:46.068 --> 00:00:48.066
and frankly, changed my life.

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.204
You see, the story was about an eclipse,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:55.772
a partial solar eclipse
that was set to cross the country

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:57.628
in May of 1994.

00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:00.635
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.936
and he explained what was going to happen
and how to view it,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.181
but he emphasized that, as interesting
as a partial solar eclipse is,

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:13.715
a much rarer total solar eclipse
is completely different.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.593
In a total eclipse,
for all of two or three minutes,

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:20.948
the moon completely blocks
the face of the sun,

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:26.212
creating what he described
as the most awe-inspiring spectacle

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:27.632
in all of nature.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.789
And so the advice he gave me was this:

00:01:31.907 --> 00:01:34.904
"Before you die," he said,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.205
"you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse."

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:42.406
Well honestly,
I felt a little uncomfortable

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.838
hearing that from someone
I didn't know very well;

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:46.253
it felt sort of intimate.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:50.008
But it got my attention,
and so I did some research.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.872
Now the thing about total eclipses is,

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:55.282
if you wait for one to come to you,

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:58.698
you're going to be waiting a long time.

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:03.242
Any given point on earth
experiences a total eclipse

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:06.322
about once every 400 years.

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:10.746
But if you're willing to travel,
you don't have to wait that long.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.087
And so I learned
that a few years later, in 1998,

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:17.898
a total eclipse was going
to cross the Caribbean.

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.550
Now, a total eclipse is visible
only along a narrow path,

00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:24.254
about a hundred miles wide,

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.372
and that's where the moon's shadow falls.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.527
It's called the "path of totality."

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:30.974
And in February 1998,

00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:34.445
the path of totality
was going to cross Aruba.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.785
So I talked to my husband,
and we thought: February? Aruba?

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.528
Sounded like a good idea anyway.

00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:41.624
(Laughter)

00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:44.283
So we headed south,

00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:46.779
to enjoy the sun
and to see what would happen

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:48.618
when the sun briefly went away.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.347
Well, the day of the eclipse
found us and many other people

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.552
out behind the Hyatt Regency,

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:55.739
on the beach,

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:57.474
waiting for the show to begin.

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:00.669
And we wore eclipse glasses
with cardboard frames

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:04.812
and really dark lenses that enabled us
to look at the sun safely.

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:10.022
A total eclipse begins
as a partial eclipse,

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.822
as the moon very slowly makes its way
in front of the sun.

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:18.074
So first it looked the sun
had a little notch in its edge,

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.219
and then that notch grew
larger and larger,

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.091
turning the sun into a crescent.

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:27.399
And it was all very interesting,
but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:29.347
I mean, the day remained bright.

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:32.381
If I hadn't known
what was going on overhead,

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:34.818
I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:40.682
Well, about 10 minutes before
the total solar eclipse was set to begin,

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.497
weird things started to happen.

00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:45.610
A cool wind kicked up.

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:50.541
Daylight looked odd,
and shadows became very strange;

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:52.799
they looked bizarrely sharp,

00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:56.614
as if someone had turned up
the contrast knob on the TV.

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:01.454
Then I looked offshore,
and I noticed running lights on boats,

00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:04.041
so clearly it was getting dark,

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:05.651
although I hadn't realized it.

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:07.948
Well soon, it was obvious
it was getting dark.

00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.116
It felt like my eyesight was failing.

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:12.780
And then all of a sudden,

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:14.168
the lights went out.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.288
Well, at that,

00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:19.929
a cheer erupted from the beach,

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:21.846
and I took off my eclipse glasses,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.461
because at this point
during the total eclipse,

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:27.580
it was safe to look at the sun
with the naked eye.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.001
And I glanced upward,

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:34.636
and I was just dumbstruck.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:42.098
Now, consider that, at this point,
I was in my mid-30s.

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:48.735
I had lived on earth long enough
to know what the sky looks like.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.640
I mean --

00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:51.746
(Laughter)

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.864
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:58.829
and starry skies and angry skies

00:04:58.853 --> 00:05:00.961
and pink skies at sunrise.

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:04.766
But here was a sky I had never seen.

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:08.413
First, there were the colors.

00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:11.402
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,

00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:12.839
like twilight.

00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:14.573
But on the horizon it was orange,

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:15.898
like sunset,

00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:17.516
360 degrees.

00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:20.888
And up above, in the twilight,

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:23.337
bright stars and planets had come out.

00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:24.963
So there was Jupiter

00:05:24.987 --> 00:05:26.723
and there was Mercury

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:28.020
and there was Venus.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.925
They were all in a line.

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:35.302
And there, along this line,

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:38.574
was this thing,

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:42.122
this glorious, bewildering thing.

00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:46.897
It looked like a wreath
woven from silvery thread,

00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:50.115
and it just hung out there
in space, shimmering.

00:05:52.322 --> 00:05:55.962
That was the sun's outer atmosphere,

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:57.795
the solar corona.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.178
And pictures just don't do it justice.

00:06:00.202 --> 00:06:04.735
It's not just a ring or halo
around the sun;

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.369
it's finely textured,
like it's made out of strands of silk.

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:12.084
And although it looked
nothing like our sun,

00:06:12.108 --> 00:06:14.362
of course, I knew that's what it was.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:18.218
So there was the sun,
and there were the planets,

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:22.273
and I could see how the planets
revolve around the sun.

00:06:22.297 --> 00:06:25.082
It's like I had left our solar system

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:27.702
and was standing on some alien world,

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:29.491
looking back at creation.

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.990
And for the first time in my life,

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:37.036
I just felt viscerally connected
to the universe

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.681
in all of its immensity.

00:06:39.927 --> 00:06:41.435
Time stopped,

00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:44.755
or it just kind of felt nonexistent,

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.863
and what I beheld with my eyes --

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:49.372
I didn't just see it,

00:06:50.255 --> 00:06:52.002
it felt like a vision.

00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:56.536
And I stood there in this nirvana

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.986
for all of 174 seconds --
less than three minutes --

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.393
when all of a sudden, it was over.

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:06.768
The sun burst out,

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.454
the blue sky returned,

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:11.655
the stars and the planets
and the corona were gone.

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:13.496
The world returned to normal.

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:16.116
But I had changed.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.695
And that's how I became an umbraphile --

00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:22.567
an eclipse chaser.

00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:23.600
(Laughter)

00:07:23.624 --> 00:07:28.294
So, this is how I spend my time
and hard-earned money.

00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:34.447
Every couple of years, I head off
to wherever the moon's shadow will fall

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:36.861
to experience another couple minutes

00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:38.345
of cosmic bliss,

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.656
and to share the experience with others:

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.687
with friends in Australia,

00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:45.264
with an entire city in Germany.

00:07:45.288 --> 00:07:49.626
In 1999, in Munich,
I joined hundreds of thousands

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.411
who filled the streets and the rooftops
and cheered in unison

00:07:54.435 --> 00:07:56.362
as the solar corona emerged.

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.755
And over time, I've become something else:

00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:02.406
an eclipse evangelist.

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:04.776
I see it as my job

00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:10.385
to pay forward the advice
that I received all those years ago.

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.218
And so let me tell you:

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.583
before you die,

00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:21.585
you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse.

00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:25.490
It is the ultimate experience of awe.

00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:31.184
Now, that word, "awesome,"
has grown so overused

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:33.372
that it's lost its original meaning.

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:37.875
True awe, a sense of wonder
and insignificance

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:40.430
in the face of something
enormous and grand,

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:41.689
is rare in our lives.

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:45.541
But when you experience it, it's powerful.

00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:48.659
Awe dissolves the ego.

00:08:48.683 --> 00:08:50.677
It makes us feel connected.

00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:53.796
Indeed, it promotes
empathy and generosity.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.415
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome
than a total solar eclipse.

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:02.702
Unfortunately, few Americans
have seen one,

00:09:02.726 --> 00:09:04.946
because it's been 38 years

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.140
since one last touched
the continental United States

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:12.232
and 99 years since one last crossed
the breadth of the nation.

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:15.543
But that is about to change.

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.999
Over the next 35 years,

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:22.958
five total solar eclipses will visit
the continental United States,

00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:26.118
and three of them
will be especially grand.

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:31.640
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --

00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:34.343
(Applause)

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:38.453
the moon's shadow will race
from Oregon to South Carolina.

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:44.519
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow
heads north from Texas to Maine.

00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:46.715
In 2045, on August 12,

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:49.477
the path cuts from California to Florida.

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:52.524
I say:

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.084
What if we made these holidays?

00:09:56.108 --> 00:09:57.314
What if we --

00:09:57.338 --> 00:09:58.366
(Laughter)

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.072
(Applause)

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:07.153
What if we all stood together,

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:09.253
as many people as possible,

00:10:09.277 --> 00:10:11.049
in the shadow of the moon?

00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:16.913
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe
would help heal our divisions,

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:19.833
get us to treat each other
just a bit more humanely.

00:10:20.738 --> 00:10:26.564
Now, admittedly, some folks consider
my evangelizing a little out there;

00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:29.165
my obsession, eccentric.

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:34.692
I mean, why focus so much attention
on something so brief?

00:10:34.716 --> 00:10:38.418
Why cross the globe --
or state lines, for that matter --

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:41.459
for something that lasts three minutes?

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:44.135
As I said:

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:46.934
I am not a spiritual person.

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:50.397
I don't believe in God.

00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:51.729
I wish I did.

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:54.951
But when I think of my own mortality --

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:57.398
and I do, a lot --

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:02.371
when I think of everyone I have lost,

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.114
my mother in particular,

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.398
what soothes me

00:11:07.422 --> 00:11:10.514
is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:14.532
I picture myself on that beach,

00:11:14.556 --> 00:11:15.992
looking at that sky,

00:11:16.857 --> 00:11:19.029
and I remember how I felt.

00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:23.093
My existence may be temporary,

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:26.305
but that's OK because, my gosh,

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.418
look at what I'm a part of.

00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:32.163
And so this is a lesson I've learned,

00:11:32.187 --> 00:11:34.750
and it's one that applies
to life in general:

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.025
duration of experience
does not equal impact.

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:44.551
One weekend, one conversation --
hell, one glance --

00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:46.708
can change everything.

00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:51.814
Cherish those moments
of deep connection with other people,

00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.249
with the natural world,

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:55.012
and make them a priority.

00:11:55.036 --> 00:11:57.450
Yes, I chase eclipses.

00:11:57.474 --> 00:11:59.491
You might chase something else.

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:02.821
But it's not about the 174 seconds.

00:12:04.132 --> 00:12:06.820
It's about how they change

00:12:06.844 --> 00:12:08.411
the years that come after.

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:10.104
Thank you.

00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:14.761
(Applause)
