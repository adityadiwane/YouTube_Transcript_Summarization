00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.776
Great things happen at intersections.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.016
In fact, I would argue
that some of the most interesting things

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.816
of the human experience
occur at the intersections,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.496
in the liminal space,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.576
where by liminal
I mean the space in-between.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.296
There's freedom in that in-between,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.096
freedom to create from the indefiniteness
of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.336
a new self-definition.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.375
Some of the great intersections
of the world come to mind,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.616
like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.096
or Times Square in New York City,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.056
both bustling with the excitement
of a seemingly endless stream of people.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.576
Other intersections,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.456
like the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma, Alabama,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.176
or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court
in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.136
because of the tremendous energy
at the intersection of human beings,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.096
ideologies and the ongoing
struggle for justice.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.456
Beyond the physical
landscape of our planet,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.496
some of the most famous celestial images
are of intersections.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.896
Stars are born at the messy
intersection of gas and dust,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.416
instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.776
Stars die by this same intersection,
this time flung outward

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.176
in a violent collision of smaller atoms,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.920
intersecting and efficiently fusing
into altogether new and heavier things.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.736
We can all think of intersections
that have special meaning to us.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.576
To be intersectional, then,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.400
is to occupy a position
at an intersection.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.976
I've lived the entirety of my life
in the in-between,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.256
in the liminal space
between dreams and reality,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.576
race and gender,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.616
poverty and plenty,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.696
science and society.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.656
I am both black and a woman.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.016
Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.536
this robust combination of knowing
results in a shining example

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.056
of the explosive fusion of identities.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.176
I am also an astrophysicist.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.256
I study blazars, supermassive,
hyperactive black holes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.936
that sit at the centers
of massive galaxies

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.816
and shoot out jets
nearby those black holes

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.576
at speeds approaching the speed of light

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.240
in a process we are still trying
to completely understand.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.696
I have dreamed
of becoming an astrophysicist

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.176
since I was 12 years old.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.576
I had no idea that at that time,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.296
according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive
of African-American women in physics,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.656
only 18 black women in the United States
had ever earned a PhD

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.656
in a physics-related discipline,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.336
and that the first black woman to graduate
with a PhD in an astronomy-related field

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.000
did so just one year before my birth.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.696
As I journeyed along my path,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.576
I encountered the best and worst
of life at an intersection:

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.416
the tremendous opportunity to self-define,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.976
the collision of expectation
and experience,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.736
the exhilaration
of victorious breakthroughs

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.456
and, sometimes,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.520
the explosive pain of regeneration.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.096
I began my college experience
just after my family had fallen apart.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.736
Our financial situation disintegrated

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.176
just after my father's
departure from our lives.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.096
This thrust my mother, my sister and I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.096
out of the relative comfort
of middle-class life

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.496
and into the almost constant struggle
to make ends meet.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.336
Thus, I was one of roughly
60 percent of women of color

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.216
who find finances to be a major barrier
to their educational goals.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.856
Thankfully, Norfolk State University
provided me with full funding,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.816
and I was able to achieve
my bachelor's in physics.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.856
After graduation, and despite knowing
that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.056
I fell through the cracks.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.176
It was a poster that saved my dream,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.976
and some really incredible
people and programs.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.616
The American Physical Society
had this beautiful poster

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.336
encouraging students of color
to become physicists.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.856
It was striking to me
because it featured a young black girl,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.656
probably around 12 years old,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.720
looking studiously
at some physics equations.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.376
I remember thinking

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.096
I was looking directly back
at the little girl

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.936
who first dared to dream this dream.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.896
I immediately wrote to the Society

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.816
and requested my personal
copy of the poster,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.216
which to this day
still hangs in my office.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.096
I described to them in the email
my educational path,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.016
and my desire to find myself again
in pursuit of the PhD.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.776
They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
University Bridge Program,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.576
itself an intersection
of the master's and PhD degrees

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.280
at two institutions.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.056
After two years out of school,
they accepted me into the program,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.496
and I found myself again
on the path to the PhD.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.976
After receiving my master's at Fisk,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.336
I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.496
Once I was physically occupying
the space that would ultimately give way

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.496
to my childhood aspirations,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.696
I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.696
(Laughter)

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.776
It became immediately apparent

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.816
that not everyone was thrilled
to have that degree of liminality

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.456
in their space.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.536
I was ostracized by many of my classmates,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.896
one of whom went so far as to invite me
to "do what I really came here to do"

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.360
as he pushed all the dirty dishes
from our meal in front of me to clean up.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.456
I wish that were an isolated occurrence,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.216
but for many women of color

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.056
in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics, or STEM,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.656
this is something they have long endured.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.816
One hundred percent
of the 60 women of color

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.176
interviewed in a recent study
by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.576
reported facing racialized gender bias,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.320
including being mistaken
for the janitorial staff.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.176
This mistaken identity was not reported

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.736
by any of the white women
interviewed for this study,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.360
which comprised 557 women in total.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.616
While there is nothing inherently wrong
with a janitorial position,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.056
and in fact my forefathers and foremothers
were able to attend college

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.936
because many of their parents
worked these jobs,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.760
it was a clear attempt
to put me in my place.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.056
While there was certainly
the acute pain of the encounter,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.656
the real issue is that my appearance

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.216
can tell anyone anything about my ability.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.576
Beyond that, though, it underscores

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.576
that the women of color in STEM
do not experience the same set of barriers

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.696
that just women
or just people of color face.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.576
That's why today I want to highlight
women of color in STEM,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.496
who are inexorably, unapologetically

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.320
living as the inseparable
sum of identities.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.576
STEM itself is an intersectional term,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.856
such that its true richness
cannot be appreciated

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.736
without considering
the liminal space between disciplines.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.536
Science, the pursuit
of understanding the physical world

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.656
by way of chemistry, physics, biology,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.456
cannot be accomplished
in the absence of mathematics.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.536
Engineering requires the application
of basic science and math

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.576
to the lived experience.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.296
Technology sits firmly
on the foundation of math,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.656
engineering and science.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.696
Math itself serves
the critical role of Rosetta Stone,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.456
decoding and encoding
the physical principles of the world.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.416
STEM is utterly incomplete
without each individual piece.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.816
This is to say nothing
of the enrichment that is realized

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.456
when STEM is combined
with other disciplines.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.056
The purpose for this talk is twofold:

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.816
first, to say directly to every black,
Latina, indigenous, First Nation

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.856
or any other woman or girl

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.096
who finds herself resting
at the blessed intersection

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.135
of race and gender,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:49.120
that you can be anything you want to be.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:53.655
My personal hope is
that you'll become an astrophysicist,

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:56.736
but beyond that, anything you want.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.816
Do not think for one minute

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.096
that because you are who you are,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.656
you cannot be
who you imagine yourself to be.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.136
Hold fast to those dreams

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.840
and let them carry you
into a world you can't even imagine.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.376
Secondly, among the most
pressing issues of our time,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.016
most now find
their intersection with STEM.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.056
We have as a global society solved

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.776
most of the single-faceted
issues of our time.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.256
Those that remain
require a thorough investigation

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.056
of the liminal space between disciplines

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.496
to create the multifaceted
solutions of tomorrow.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.616
Who better to solve these liminal problems

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.976
than those who have faced
their whole lives at the intersections.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.936
We as thought leaders and decision makers

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.376
must push past
the first steps of diversity

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.696
and into the richer
and more robust territory

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.736
of full inclusion and equal opportunity.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.816
One of my favorite examples
of liminal excellence

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.696
comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.456
a black woman plasma physicist,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.536
who passed away this past July
after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.656
She was a NASA project scientist
who spearheaded the NASA side

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.136
of the Rosetta mission,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.616
which became famous this year
for landing a rover on a comet,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.136
and the 1.5 billion dollar
Galileo mission to Jupiter,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.136
two high-profile scientific victories

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.256
for NASA, the United States
and the world.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.976
Dr. Alexander said it this way:

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.696
"I'm used to walking between two cultures.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.856
For me, it's among the purposes of my life

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.496
to take us from states of ignorance
to states of understanding

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.896
with bold exploration
that you can't do every day."

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.696
This shows exactly
the power of a liminal person.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.096
She had the technical ability to spearhead

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.216
some of the most ambitious
space missions of our time,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.576
and she perfectly understood her place

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.240
of being exactly who she was
in any place she was.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.856
Jessica Matthews, inventor
of the SOCCKET line of sports products,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.856
like soccer balls, that generate
renewable energy as you play with them,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.736
said it this way:

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.216
"A major part of invention
isn't just creating things,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.056
it's understanding people

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.320
and understanding the systems
that make this world."

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.136
The reason I tell my story

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.216
and the story of Dr. Alexander
and Jessica Matthews

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.096
is because they are fundamentally
intersectional stories,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.120
the stories of lives lived at the nexus
of race, gender and innovation.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.376
Despite implicit and explicit questions
of my right to be in an elite space,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.976
I'm proud to report that when I graduated,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.456
I was the first black woman
to earn a PhD in astrophysics

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.576
in Yale's then 312-year history.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.496
(Applause)

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.936
I am now part of a small but growing cadre
of women of color in STEM

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.976
who are poised to bring new perspectives
and new ideas to life

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.776
on the most pressing issues of our time:

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.976
things like educational inequities,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.976
police brutality, HIV/AIDS,
climate change, genetic editing,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.376
artificial intelligence
and Mars exploration.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.696
This is to say nothing of the things
we haven't even thought of yet.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.216
Women of color in STEM
occupy some of the toughest

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.016
and most exciting sociotechnological
issues of our time.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.376
Thus, we are uniquely positioned

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.816
to contribute to
and drive these conversations

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.976
in ways that are more inclusive
of a wider variety of lived experience.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.576
This outlook can be expanded
to the many intersectional people

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.656
whose experiences, positive and negative,

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.736
enrich the conversations
in ways that outmatch

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.840
even the best-resourced homogenous groups.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.776
This is not a request
born out of a desire to fit in.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.296
It's a reminder that we cannot get
to the best possible outcomes

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.496
for the totality of humanity

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.976
without precisely this collaboration,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.536
this bringing together of the liminal,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.056
the differently lived,
distinctly experienced

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.616
and disparately impacted.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.656
Simply put, we cannot be
the most excellent expression

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.456
of our collective genius

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.976
without the full measure
of humanity brought to bear.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.216
Thank you.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:41.120
(Applause)
