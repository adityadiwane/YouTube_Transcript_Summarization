00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:17.546
In Oxford in the 1950s,

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:21.314
there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:23.346
named Alice Stewart.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.489
And Alice was unusual partly because, of course,

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.969
she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.080
And she was brilliant, she was one of the,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.896
at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:40.653
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.748
after she had kids,

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:45.756
and even after she got divorced and was a single parent,

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.039
she continued her medical work.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.159
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.783
the emerging field of epidemiology,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.271
the study of patterns in disease.

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.439
But like every scientist, she appreciated

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.695
that to make her mark, what she needed to do

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:07.213
was find a hard problem and solve it.

00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:09.757
The hard problem that Alice chose

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:13.155
was the rising incidence of childhood cancers.

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.345
Most disease is correlated with poverty,

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:17.614
but in the case of childhood cancers,

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:20.218
the children who were dying seemed mostly to come

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:22.663
from affluent families.

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:24.406
So, what, she wanted to know,

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.488
could explain this anomaly?

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:30.271
Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:32.262
In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:34.517
from the Lady Tata Memorial prize.

00:01:34.517 --> 00:01:37.060
And that meant she knew she only had one shot

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.102
at collecting her data.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:41.579
Now, she had no idea what to look for.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.695
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.317
so she asked everything she could think of.

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:49.150
Had the children eaten boiled sweets?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.223
Had they consumed colored drinks?

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:52.870
Did they eat fish and chips?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.878
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?

00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:58.294
What time of life had they started school?

00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:01.662
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:04.582
one thing and one thing only jumped out

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.118
with the statistical clarity of a kind that

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:09.958
most scientists can only dream of.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.878
By a rate of two to one,

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:13.959
the children who had died

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.254
had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:24.759
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.666
Conventional wisdom held

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:30.663
that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.

00:02:30.663 --> 00:02:32.990
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.448
which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:40.094
of that age, which was the X-ray machine.

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:44.318
And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:48.126
which was as people who helped patients,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.822
they didn't harm them.

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:54.510
Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.094
her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:02.102
People got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,

00:03:02.102 --> 00:03:04.222
and Alice really was in a big hurry

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:08.013
to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.166
before they disappeared.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.510
In fact, she need not have hurried.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.701
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical --

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.573
British and American medical establishments

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:27.677
abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:33.158
The data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,

00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:37.382
but nobody wanted to know.

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:40.066
A child a week was dying,

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:42.799
but nothing changed.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.054
Openness alone can't drive change.

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:54.671
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.918
So, how did she know that she was right?

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:01.581
Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking.

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:03.826
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale,

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.210
and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.279
So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.737
and George was a recluse.

00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:15.751
Alice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.

00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:19.790
George frankly preferred numbers to people.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.768
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.

00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:30.104
He said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:33.661
He actively sought disconfirmation.

00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:35.998
Different ways of looking at her models,

00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:39.255
at her statistics, different ways of crunching the data

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:42.318
in order to disprove her.

00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:47.942
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.

00:04:47.942 --> 00:04:51.038
Because it was only by not being able to prove

00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:53.406
that she was wrong,

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:56.527
that George could give Alice the confidence she needed

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:59.509
to know that she was right.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.184
It's a fantastic model of collaboration --

00:05:04.184 --> 00:05:09.191
thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.

00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.543
I wonder how many of us have,

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:18.462
or dare to have, such collaborators.

00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:22.239
Alice and George were very good at conflict.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.375
They saw it as thinking.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:29.648
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require?

00:05:29.648 --> 00:05:33.023
Well, first of all, it requires that we find people

00:05:33.023 --> 00:05:35.671
who are very different from ourselves.

00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:40.007
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:44.511
which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.735
and it means we have to seek out people

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:49.207
with different backgrounds, different disciplines,

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:53.358
different ways of thinking and different experience,

00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:57.223
and find ways to engage with them.

00:05:57.223 --> 00:06:01.867
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:03.678
And the more I've thought about this,

00:06:03.678 --> 00:06:08.839
the more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.908
Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy

00:06:11.908 --> 00:06:16.599
and time if you don't really care.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.059
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.423
Alice's daughter told me

00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:26.535
that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:30.719
they made her think and think and think again.

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.737
"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight,

00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:39.879
but she was really good at them."

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:44.049
So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.336
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:50.210
many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.161
mostly haven't come from individuals,

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.049
they've come from organizations,

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:56.057
some of them bigger than countries,

00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:58.317
many of them capable of affecting hundreds,

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:02.320
thousands, even millions of lives.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.758
So how do organizations think?

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:10.784
Well, for the most part, they don't.

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:13.777
And that isn't because they don't want to,

00:07:13.777 --> 00:07:16.182
it's really because they can't.

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:19.529
And they can't because the people inside of them

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:23.737
are too afraid of conflict.

00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:26.601
In surveys of European and American executives,

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.571
fully 85 percent of them acknowledged

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:33.088
that they had issues or concerns at work

00:07:33.088 --> 00:07:36.721
that they were afraid to raise.

00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:39.880
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.248
afraid to get embroiled in arguments

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:44.279
that they did not know how to manage,

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:48.856
and felt that they were bound to lose.

00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:55.033
Eighty-five percent is a really big number.

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:57.848
It means that organizations mostly can't do

00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:00.176
what George and Alice so triumphantly did.

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:04.575
They can't think together.

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:06.816
And it means that people like many of us,

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:09.000
who have run organizations,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.567
and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,

00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:18.840
mostly fail to get the best out of them.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.176
So how do we develop the skills that we need?

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:26.259
Because it does take skill and practice, too.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:29.673
If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,

00:08:29.673 --> 00:08:31.832
we have to see it as thinking,

00:08:31.832 --> 00:08:36.168
and then we have to get really good at it.

00:08:36.168 --> 00:08:40.432
So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,

00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:43.904
and Joe worked for a medical device company.

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:46.879
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:49.904
He thought that it was too complicated

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.768
and he thought that its complexity

00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:56.035
created margins of error that could really hurt people.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:00.175
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.

00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:02.480
But when he looked around his organization,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.941
nobody else seemed to be at all worried.

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:09.496
So, he didn't really want to say anything.

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:11.680
After all, maybe they knew something he didn't.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.264
Maybe he'd look stupid.

00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:16.470
But he kept worrying about it,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.516
and he worried about it so much that he got to the point

00:09:19.516 --> 00:09:21.675
where he thought the only thing he could do

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:25.805
was leave a job he loved.

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:29.805
In the end, Joe and I found a way

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:31.660
for him to raise his concerns.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.531
And what happened then is what almost always

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.125
happens in this situation.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:39.346
It turned out everybody had exactly the same

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.092
questions and doubts.

00:09:41.092 --> 00:09:45.124
So now Joe had allies. They could think together.

00:09:45.124 --> 00:09:48.388
And yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:52.692
and argument, but that allowed everyone around the table

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:56.772
to be creative, to solve the problem,

00:09:56.772 --> 00:10:01.100
and to change the device.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.476
Joe was what a lot of people might think of

00:10:04.476 --> 00:10:06.748
as a whistle-blower,

00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:09.463
except that like almost all whistle-blowers,

00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:11.836
he wasn't a crank at all,

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:15.284
he was passionately devoted to the organization

00:10:15.284 --> 00:10:18.732
and the higher purposes that that organization served.

00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:22.548
But he had been so afraid of conflict,

00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:27.628
until finally he became more afraid of the silence.

00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:29.487
And when he dared to speak,

00:10:29.487 --> 00:10:32.885
he discovered much more inside himself

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:38.127
and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.

00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:41.458
And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:46.586
They think of him as a leader.

00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:50.954
So, how do we have these conversations more easily

00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:52.867
and more often?

00:10:52.867 --> 00:10:54.853
Well, the University of Delft

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.250
requires that its PhD students

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.163
have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.

00:11:01.163 --> 00:11:04.547
It doesn't really matter what the statements are about,

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:08.339
what matters is that the candidates are willing and able

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:10.942
to stand up to authority.

00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:13.306
I think it's a fantastic system,

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:15.819
but I think leaving it to PhD candidates

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:20.124
is far too few people, and way too late in life.

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:23.290
I think we need to be teaching these skills

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.370
to kids and adults at every stage of their development,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.819
if we want to have thinking organizations

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:33.466
and a thinking society.

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:39.084
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed

00:11:39.084 --> 00:11:45.475
rarely come from information that is secret or hidden.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:49.779
It comes from information that is freely available and out there,

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:52.163
but that we are willfully blind to,

00:11:52.163 --> 00:11:55.291
because we can't handle, don't want to handle,

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:59.698
the conflict that it provokes.

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:02.627
But when we dare to break that silence,

00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:05.284
or when we dare to see,

00:12:05.284 --> 00:12:07.539
and we create conflict,

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:10.164
we enable ourselves and the people around us

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:14.410
to do our very best thinking.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.786
Open information is fantastic,

00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:20.970
open networks are essential.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.947
But the truth won't set us free

00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:26.711
until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent

00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:30.848
and the moral courage to use it.

00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:34.608
Openness isn't the end.

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:37.250
It's the beginning.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:48.729
