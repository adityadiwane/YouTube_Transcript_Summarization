00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm sure that, throughout the hundred-thousand-odd years

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
of our species' existence,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
and even before,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
our ancestors looked up at the night sky,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
and wondered what stars are.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
Wondering, therefore,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
how to explain what they saw

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.330
in terms of things unseen.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
Okay, so, most people

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
only wondered that occasionally, like today,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
in breaks from whatever

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
normally preoccupied them.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
But what normally preoccupied them

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
also involved yearning to know.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
They wished they knew

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
how to prevent their food supply

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
from sometimes failing,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
and how they could rest when they were tired

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.330
without risking starvation,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.330
be warmer, cooler, safer,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
in less pain.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I bet those prehistoric cave artists

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
would have loved to know

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
how to draw better.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.330
In every aspect of their lives,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.330
they wished for progress, just as we do.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.330
But they failed, almost completely, to make any.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
They didn't know how to.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
Discoveries like fire

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
the world never improved.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Nothing new was learned.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
The first clue to the origin of starlight

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.330
happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
Within 40 years,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
physicists discovered the whole explanation,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.330
expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
But never mind the symbols.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Think how many discoveries

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
they represent.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.330
But isotopes, particles of electricity,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
antimatter,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
neutrinos,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 --

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
gamma rays,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
transmutation.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.330
That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
was achieved through these same theories

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
that explained starlight

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
and other ancient mysteries,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
and new, unexpected phenomena.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
That all that, discovered in 40 years,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
had not been in the previous hundred thousand,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
was not for lack of thinking

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.330
about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
They even arrived at answers,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
such as myths,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
that dominated their lives,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
yet bore almost no resemblance

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
to the truth.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.330
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
These were people with brains of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
essentially the same design

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.330
that eventually did discover all those things.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.330
But that ability to make progress

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
remained almost unused,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
until the event that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
revolutionized the human condition

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
and changed the universe.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Or so we should hope.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Because that event was the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
Scientific Revolution,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
ever since which our knowledge

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
of the physical world,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
and of how to adapt it to our wishes,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
has been growing relentlessly.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
Now, what had changed?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
What were people now doing for the first time

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
that made that difference

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
between stagnation

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and rapid, open-ended discovery?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
How to make that difference

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
is surely the most important universal truth

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
that it is possible to know.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Worryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
So, I'll tell you.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Before the Scientific Revolution,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
they believed that everything important, knowable,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
was already known,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
enshrined in ancient writings, institutions,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
along with many falsehoods.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
So they believed that knowledge came from authorities

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
that actually knew very little.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
And therefore progress

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
depended on learning how to reject

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
the authority of learned men,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
priests, traditions and rulers.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Which is why the Scientific Revolution

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
had to have a wider context.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.330
The Enlightenment, a revolution in how

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
people sought knowledge,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
trying not to rely on authority.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
"Take no one's word for it."

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
But that can't be what made the difference.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
Authorities had been rejected before, many times.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
And that rarely, if ever,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
caused anything like the Scientific Revolution.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
At the time, what they thought

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
distinguished science

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.330
was a radical idea about things unseen,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
known as empiricism.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.330
All knowledge derives from the senses.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
It did help by promoting

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
observation and experiment.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
But, from the outset, it was obvious

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
that there was something horribly wrong with it.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Knowledge comes from the senses.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
in which, Galileo rightly said,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
the book of nature is written.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
Look at the world. You don't see equations

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
carved on to the mountainsides.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
If you did, it would be because people

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
had carved them.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
By the way, why don't we do that?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
What's wrong with us?

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.330
(Laughter)

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Empiricism is inadequate

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
because, well,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
And the unseen, you have to admit,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
doesn't come to us through the senses.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.330
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
We don't see the origin of species.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.330
We don't see the curvature of space-time,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
and other universes.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
But we know about those things.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
How?

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.330
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
The unseen resembles the seen.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
But it doesn't.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.330
You know what the clinching evidence was

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
that space-time is curved?

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
It was a photograph, not of space-time,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.330
but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And the evidence for evolution?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
Some rocks and some finches.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
And parallel universes? Again: dots there,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
rather than there, on a screen.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
What we see, in all these cases,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.330
bears no resemblance to the reality

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
that we conclude is responsible --

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
only a long chain of theoretical reasoning

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
and interpretation connects them.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
"Ah!" say creationists.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
"So you admit it's all interpretation.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
No one has ever seen evolution.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
We see rocks.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
You have your interpretation. We have ours.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
Yours comes from guesswork,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.330
ours from the Bible."

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:49.330
But what creationist and empiricists both ignore

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
is that, in that sense,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
no one has ever seen a bible either,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
Brains only detect nerve impulses.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
And they don't perceive even those as what they really are,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
namely electrical crackles.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
Our connection to reality

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
is never just perception.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
theory-laden.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.330
It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
tested by observation,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.330
not derived from it.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
So, were testable conjectures

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
No. Contrary to what's usually said,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
testability is common,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330
in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.330
Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
has got a testable prediction.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
Consider the ancient Greek myth

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
explaining seasons.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
Hades, God of the Underworld,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
kidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
and negotiates a forced marriage contract,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
requiring her to return regularly, and lets her go.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
And each year,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
she is magically compelled to return.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
And her mother, Demeter,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
Goddess of the Earth,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.330
is sad, and makes it cold and barren.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
That myth is testable.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.330
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.330
is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
they'd have known that their theory is false.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.330
So what was wrong with that myth,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
and with all pre-scientific thinking,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.330
and what, then, made that momentous difference?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.330
I think there is one thing you have to care about.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And that implies

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
testability, the scientific method,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
the Enlightenment, and everything.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
And here is the crucial thing.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
There is such a thing as a defect in a story.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:25.330
I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
What does that mean? Well, explanation

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
is an assertion about what's there, unseen,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
that accounts for what's seen.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
Because the explanatory role

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
of Persephone's marriage contract

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
could be played equally well

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
by infinitely many other

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
ad hoc entities.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Why a marriage contract and not any other reason

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
for regular annual action?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Here is one. Persephone wasn't released.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.330
She escaped, and returns every spring

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
to take revenge on Hades,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
with her Spring powers.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:08.330
She cools his domain with Spring air,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.330
That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
It's equally testable.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
Yet what it asserts about reality

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
is, in many ways, the opposite.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
And that is possible because

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
the details of the original myth

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
are unrelated to seasons,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.330
except via the myth itself.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
This easy variability

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.330
is the sign of a bad explanation,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.330
because, without a functional reason to prefer

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.330
one of countless variants,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
advocating one of them, in preference to the others,

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
is irrational.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
So, for the essence of what

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
makes the difference to enable progress,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330
seek good explanations,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
the ones that can't be easily varied,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.330
while still explaining the phenomena.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
Now, our current explanation of seasons

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.330
is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and away for the other half.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Better put that up.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.330
(Laughter)

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:31.330
That's a good explanation: hard to vary,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
because every detail plays a functional role.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
For instance, we know, independently of seasons,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
that surfaces tilted away

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
from radiant heat are heated less,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.330
and that a spinning sphere, in space,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
points in a constant direction.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And the tilt also explains

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and predicts that the seasons

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
If they'd been observed in phase,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
the theory would have been refuted.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.330
But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:14.330
hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
If the ancient Greeks had found out

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
about seasons in Australia,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
they could have easily varied their myth

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
to predict that.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
For instance, when Demeter is upset,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
she banishes heat from her vicinity,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.330
into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
So, being proved wrong by observation,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
and changing their theory accordingly,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
one jot closer to understanding seasons,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
because their explanation was bad: easy to vary.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
And it's only when an explanation is good

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
that it even matters whether it's testable.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
its defenders would have had nowhere to go.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
No easily implemented change

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
could make that tilt

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.330
cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
The search for hard-to-vary explanations

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
is the origin of all progress.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
It's the basic regulating principle

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
of the Enlightenment.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
One is well known: untestable theories.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
But the more important one is explanationless theories.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.330
Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
of what causes that trend,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
you're being told a wizard did it.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
When you are told that carrots have human rights

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
because they share half our genes --

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:50.330
but not how gene percentages confer rights -- wizard.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
has been settled because there is evidence

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
that a given percentage of our

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
political opinions are genetically inherited,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.330
but they don't explain how genes cause opinions,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
they've settled nothing. They are saying that our

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
opinions are caused by wizards,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.330
and presumably so are their own.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
That the truth consists of

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.330
hard to vary assertions about reality

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
is the most important fact

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
about the physical world.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
It's a fact that is, itself, unseen,

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.330
yet impossible to vary. Thank you.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.330
(Applause)
