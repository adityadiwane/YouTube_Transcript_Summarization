00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I work with a species called "Bonobo."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I'm happy most of the time,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's kind of a well-kept secret.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This species lives only in the Congo.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Their sexual behavior is too human-like

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for most of us to be comfortable with.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughter)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that they sort of set aside.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It permeates their entire life.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And it's used for communication.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And it's used for conflict resolution.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
divided our lives up into lots of parts.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We divided our world up with lots of categories.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But I don't think that we were that way initially.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and that there's something very, very special about man.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Maybe it's something special in his brain

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that allows him to have language.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Maybe it's something special in his brain

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
around the 1600s and they had no fire.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They had no stone tools.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
To our knowledge they had no music.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So when you compare them to the Bonobo,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the Bonobo is a little hairier.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
He doesn't stand quite as upright.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But there are a lot of similarities.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I think that as we look at culture,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we kind of come to understand

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
how we got to where we are.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I don't really think it's in our biology;

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I think we've attributed it to our biology,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but I don't really think it's there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So what I want to do now is introduce you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to a species called the Bonobo.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is Kanzi.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He's a Bonobo.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And she came to us when she was just at puberty,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
about six or seven years of age.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and a chimpanzee on your left.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is more upright, just as we are.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
between the way a Bonobo walks

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
As they turn toward us you'll see

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And now we see all four.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
encircled by the Congo River.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
grow densely in the area.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It was a Japanese scientist

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
almost three decades ago.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
None of them are tricks.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
by NHK of Japan.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We have eight Bonobos.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
SS: An entire family at our research centre.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Video: You going to help get some sticks?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Good.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We need more sticks, too.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
That's a wasps' nest.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You can get it out.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I hope I have a lighter.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You can use the lighter to start the fire.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
make a fire without a lighter.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
He's learning the uses for a fire,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
just by watching what we do with fire.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
(Laughter)

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
These are happy vocalizations.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Video: You're happy.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
You're very happy about this part.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Good job.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But he likes to carry things from place to place.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
farther than we can hear.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This is his sister.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Video: Goodbye.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
(Laughter)

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
She switches from reverse to forward

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
(Laughter)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
(Music)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and documenting their development across two decades,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
scientists are exploring how cultural forces

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
(Laughter)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
may have operated during human evolution.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
His name is Nyota.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It means "star" in Swahili.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
(Music)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
to groom Nyota.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Very impressive.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to perform delicate tasks like this.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Panbanisha, like any human mother,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
carefully tugs to get the scissors back.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
He can now cut through tough animal hide.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
just as our ancestors may have made them,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
two-and-a-half million years ago --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
He has learned that by using both hands

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and aiming his glancing blows,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
he can make much larger, sharper flakes.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
requiring great skill.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and is identical to that used by our African ancestors

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
two-and-a-half million years ago.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
These are the rocks Kanzi used

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and these are the flakes he made.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
She keeps staring out the window.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
SS: I normally talk about language.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I haven't told you that these apes have language.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It's a geometric language.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Video: She takes a piece of chalk

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and begins writing something on the floor.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
What is she writing?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
(Music)

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They speak when she touches them.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
SS: That's an institutional requirement.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and several straight lines.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Panbanisha watched.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Soon she began to write as well.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
How did they develop?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
SS (video): We found that the most important thing

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's simply to use language around them,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
because the driving force in language acquisition

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Once you have that capacity,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
the ability to produce language

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
comes rather naturally and rather freely.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
we want to create an environment in which they have fun,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and an environment in which the others

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
are meaningful individuals for them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in Kanzi and Panbanisha.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Is he looking for where the sound came from?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
She wasn't forced to learn the piano;

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Kanzi and Panbanisha

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Laughter)

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Take the cherries too.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Now watch out, stay away from them now.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Now you have to stay away. Get away.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Run away. Run.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh no!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
We're learning how to become like them.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
We're learning how to communicate with them,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in really high-pitched tones.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And they're learning to become like us.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So we're sharing tools and technology and language

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
with another species.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Thank you.
