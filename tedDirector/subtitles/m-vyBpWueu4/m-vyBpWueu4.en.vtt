00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:20.341
There's a group of people in Kenya.

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:24.345
People cross oceans to go see them.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:26.379
These people are tall.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.886
They jump high. They wear red.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:32.998
And they kill lions.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.055
You might be wondering, who are these people?

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.649
These are the Maasais.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.551
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.911
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.

00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:52.158
The girls are brought up to be mothers.

00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:54.686
When I was five years old,

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:57.254
I found out that I was engaged

00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:00.340
to be married as soon as I reached puberty.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.326
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties,

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.504
they constantly reminded me that

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:08.224
your husband just passed by.

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:13.170
(Laughter) Cool, yeah?

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.335
And everything I had to do from that moment

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.966
was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:24.543
My day started at 5 in the morning,

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:26.700
milking the cows, sweeping the house,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.239
cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.481
I did everything that I needed to do

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.108
to become a perfect wife.

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:41.172
I went to school not because the Maasais'

00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:43.813
women or girls were going to school.

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:46.970
It's because my mother was denied an education,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.439
and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.387
she never wanted us to live the life she was living.

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:56.916
Why did she say that?

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.244
My father worked as a policeman in the city.

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:01.874
He came home once a year.

00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:05.231
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:09.119
And whenever he came home, it was a different case.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.124
My mother worked hard in the farm

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.990
to grow crops so that we can eat.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.093
She reared the cows and the goats

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.108
so that she can care for us.

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:19.938
But when my father came, he would sell the cows,

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:22.321
he would sell the products we had,

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.516
and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:27.909
Because my mother was a woman,

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.910
she was not allowed to own any property,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.404
and by default, everything in my family anyway

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:36.076
belongs to my father, so he had the right.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.365
And if my mother ever questioned him,

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:45.153
he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:48.159
When I went to school, I had a dream.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.564
I wanted to become a teacher.

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.370
Teachers looked nice.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.623
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:57.726
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:00.981
(Laughter)

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.482
But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board --

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:07.556
not hard work, that's what I thought,

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.436
compared to what I was doing in the farm.

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:12.383
So I wanted to become a teacher.

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:16.286
I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:18.690
it was a determining factor.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.263
In our tradition, there is a ceremony

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.096
that girls have to undergo to become women,

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:26.677
and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.

00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:30.245
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade,

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.796
and that was a transition for me to go to high school.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.377
This was the crossroad.

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:39.899
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:44.141
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.656
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:49.220
to figure these things out.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.356
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:56.556
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:59.136
if you let me go back to school."

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:01.724
The reason why, if I ran away,

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:05.170
my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.211
the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.

00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:12.230
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.082
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,

00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:18.415
you'll go to school after the ceremony."

00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.035
I did. The ceremony happened.

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.616
It's a whole week long of excitement.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:26.781
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.

00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:29.749
And the day before the actual ceremony happens,

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.237
we were dancing, having excitement,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:36.160
and through all the night we did not sleep.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.490
The actual day came, and we walked out of the house

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.644
that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.

00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:45.513
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.

00:04:45.513 --> 00:04:48.124
They were all in a circle.

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:49.783
And as we danced and danced,

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:52.628
and we approached this circle of women,

00:04:52.628 --> 00:04:55.779
men, women, children, everybody was there.

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.347
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it,

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:02.885
and this woman was waiting to hold us.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.560
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.554
and as I approached her,

00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:12.273
she looked at me, and I sat down.

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:15.851
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.

00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:19.319
As I opened my leg, another woman came,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.675
and this woman was carrying a knife.

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:26.259
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.648
and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.

00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:35.911
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.

00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:41.009
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.132
It's something that so many girls --

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:47.030
I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.441
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,

00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:56.242
and it was difficult.

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:58.979
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.976
that most women don't do.

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:04.803
Three days later, after everybody has left the home,

00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:06.525
my mom went and brought a nurse.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.379
We were taken care of.

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.972
Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:16.443
I was so determined to be a teacher now

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:20.443
so that I could make a difference in my family.

00:06:20.443 --> 00:06:24.210
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.824
I met a young gentleman from our village

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:29.057
who had been to the University of Oregon.

00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:34.933
This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.229
white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.156
There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:45.619
They were sneakers, and this is in a village

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.689
that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.676
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:58.924
because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.

00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:01.189
And he told me, "Well,

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:02.323
what do you mean, you want to go?

00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:04.643
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"

00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:07.448
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.

00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:10.606
Just tell me how to get there."

00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:13.208
This gentleman, he helped me.

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:16.055
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:19.323
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,

00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:22.643
so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:26.334
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.

00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:29.779
Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.423
is my father by default --

00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:35.606
my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:38.739
So the news came, I applied to school

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:42.971
and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:47.411
and I couldn't come without the support of the village,

00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:49.403
because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:52.683
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.

00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:55.371
But I needed the support of the village,

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.953
and here again, when the men heard,

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:03.030
and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.455
they said, "What a lost opportunity.

00:08:05.455 --> 00:08:09.100
This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.427
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:15.745
There's a belief among our people

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.115
that morning brings good news.

00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:21.977
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning,

00:08:21.977 --> 00:08:24.379
because there's good news in the morning.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:28.583
And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:32.235
who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.

00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:35.890
So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.651
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.200
"My child, what are you doing here?"

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.475
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:48.707
I promised him that I would be the best girl,

00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:51.941
I will come back, anything they wanted after that,

00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.100
I will do it for them.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.194
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."

00:08:56.194 --> 00:08:59.741
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went --

00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:02.278
16 more men -- every single morning

00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:03.862
I went and visited them.

00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:05.603
They all came together.

00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:08.593
The village, the women, the men, everybody came together

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:11.912
to support me to come to get an education.

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:16.675
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?

00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:19.884
I found snow!

00:09:19.884 --> 00:09:23.042
I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:26.118
and lots of food in the cafeteria.

00:09:26.118 --> 00:09:28.771
I was in a land of plenty.

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:34.536
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:37.168
I discovered a lot of things.

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:40.209
I learned that that ceremony that I went through

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:45.404
when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:49.078
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.

00:09:49.078 --> 00:09:53.030
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.108
to get an education. I had a right.

00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:00.547
And as we speak right now, three million girls

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:05.888
in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.

00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:09.063
I learned that my mom had a right to own property.

00:10:09.063 --> 00:10:11.952
I learned that she did not have to be abused

00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:14.395
because she is a woman.

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:17.482
Those things made me angry.

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:19.383
I wanted to do something.

00:10:19.383 --> 00:10:21.952
As I went back, every time I went,

00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:24.920
I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.994
They were getting mutilated, and here,

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:30.530
after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.053
I went back to school to get my graduate work,

00:10:33.053 --> 00:10:37.163
the constant cry of these girls was in my face.

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:39.989
I had to do something.

00:10:39.989 --> 00:10:42.909
As I went back, I started talking to the men,

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.496
to the village, and mothers, and I said,

00:10:44.496 --> 00:10:46.516
"I want to give back the way I had promised you

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:49.228
that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"

00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:51.346
As I spoke to the women, they told me,

00:10:51.346 --> 00:10:53.322
"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:56.078
Because there had not been any school for girls.

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:57.891
And the reason they wanted the school for girls

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:01.517
is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,

00:11:01.517 --> 00:11:03.725
the mother is blamed for that.

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:07.137
If she got pregnant before she got married,

00:11:07.137 --> 00:11:09.506
the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.147
She's beaten.

00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:14.882
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.525
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:19.898
the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:

00:11:19.898 --> 00:11:22.301
"We want a school for boys."

00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:25.605
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village

00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:28.277
who have been out and they have gotten an education.

00:11:28.277 --> 00:11:30.349
Why can't they build a school for boys,

00:11:30.349 --> 00:11:32.646
and I'll build a school for girls?"

00:11:32.646 --> 00:11:35.921
That made sense. And they agreed.

00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:40.580
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.372
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.831
We have.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.963
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:52.603
Angeline came to apply for the school,

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:56.203
and she did not meet any criteria that we had.

00:11:56.203 --> 00:11:58.946
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.

00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:01.690
But she was older. She was 12 years old,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.802
and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.

00:12:04.802 --> 00:12:06.597
Angeline had been moving from one place --

00:12:06.597 --> 00:12:08.938
because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father --

00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:11.292
moving from one grandmother's house to another one,

00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:14.926
from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.

00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:17.514
And I looked at her, I remember that day,

00:12:17.514 --> 00:12:22.046
and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:24.942
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.

00:12:24.942 --> 00:12:27.912
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.

00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:31.139
Five months later, that is Angeline.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:33.905
A transformation had begun in her life.

00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:36.647
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world

00:12:36.647 --> 00:12:38.380
and make a difference.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.180
She was not the top student when we took her.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.676
Now she's the best student, not just in our school,

00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:45.825
but in the entire division that we are in.

00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:50.146
That's Sharon. That's five years later.

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:57.315
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.

00:12:57.315 --> 00:13:00.590
As a new dawn is happening in my school,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.849
a new beginning is happening.

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:08.193
As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.

00:13:08.193 --> 00:13:12.889
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:18.857
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.

00:13:18.857 --> 00:13:21.130
This is the thing that we are doing,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.457
giving them opportunities where they can rise.

00:13:24.457 --> 00:13:28.112
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten

00:13:28.112 --> 00:13:31.658
because of the revolutions we've started in our community.

00:13:31.658 --> 00:13:39.338
(Applause)

00:13:39.338 --> 00:13:42.173
I want to challenge you today.

00:13:42.173 --> 00:13:45.077
You are listening to me because you are here,

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:47.521
very optimistic.

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:51.035
You are somebody who is so passionate.

00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:54.882
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.

00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:59.388
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.

00:13:59.388 --> 00:14:02.137
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.

00:14:02.137 --> 00:14:05.703
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.

00:14:05.703 --> 00:14:09.481
I want to challenge you today that to be the first,

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.978
because people will follow you.

00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:14.202
Be the first. People will follow you.

00:14:14.202 --> 00:14:19.485
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.

00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:22.765
Move out, because as you change your world,

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.204
as you change your community,

00:14:25.204 --> 00:14:30.004
as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,

00:14:30.004 --> 00:14:33.324
one village, one country at a time.

00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:36.189
We are making a difference, so if you change your world,

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:38.238
you are going to change your community,

00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:40.030
you are going to change your country,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.997
and think about that. If you do that, and I do that,

00:14:42.997 --> 00:14:46.597
aren't we going to create a better future for our children,

00:14:46.597 --> 00:14:48.832
for your children, for our grandchildren?

00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:53.037
And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

00:14:53.037 --> 00:15:10.189
(Applause)
