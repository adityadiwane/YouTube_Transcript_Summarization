00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.722
In Kenya, 1984 is known

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.333
as the year of the cup,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.753
or the goro goro.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.671
The goro goro is a cup used to measure

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:26.981
two kilograms of maize flower on the market,

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:30.121
and the maize flower is used to make ugali,

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.078
a polenta-like cake that is eaten
together with vegetables.

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:36.393
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:38.518
on most Kenyan farms,

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:40.791
which means that most families can feed themselves

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.972
from their own farm.

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:46.900
One goro goro can feed three meals

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.881
for an average family,

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.970
and in 1984, the whole harvest

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.142
could fit in one goro goro.

00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:57.992
It was and still is one of the worst droughts

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.635
in living memory.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:03.594
Now today, I insure farmers against droughts

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:05.655
like those in the year of the cup,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:10.641
or to be more specific, I insure the rains.

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.090
I come from a family of missionaries

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.241
who built hospitals in Indonesia,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.518
and my father built a psychiatric hospital

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:18.774
in Tanzania.

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:21.875
This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.196
I don't think they thought I'd grow up

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:27.162
to sell insurance. (Laughter)

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:30.203
So let me tell you how that happened.

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:31.920
In 2008, I was working

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.204
for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:36.200
and my boss had just been promoted

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.607
to become the minister.

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:39.495
She launched an ambitious plan

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.824
to start a green revolution in her country,

00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:43.444
and before we knew it, we were importing

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.737
tons of fertilizer and seed

00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:48.462
and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:49.997
and plant.

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:51.890
A couple of weeks later,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.603
the International Monetary Fund visited us,

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:56.133
and asked my minister,

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.945
"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:03.118
reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:05.267
My minister answered proudly

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.281
and somewhat defiantly,

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:11.871
"I am going to pray for rain."

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:15.071
That ended the discussion.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.225
On the way back to the ministry in the car,

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:19.306
she turned around to me and said,

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.376
"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:24.515
Go find us some insurance."

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.552
It's been six years since,

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:28.542
and last year I was fortunate enough

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:30.048
to be part of a team that insured

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:33.953
over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.890
against drought.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.970
They owned an average of half an acre

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.423
and paid on average two Euros in premium.

00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:43.800
It's microinsurance.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.855
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.768
with two to three Euros of premium,

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:50.675
because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:52.617
A farmer here in Germany would be visited

00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:55.102
for the start of the season, halfway through,

00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:57.589
and at the end, and again if there was a loss,

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.995
to estimate the damages.

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:04.130
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.959
the maths of doing those visits

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.030
simply don't add up.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.871
So instead, we rely on technology and data.

00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:15.077
This satellite measures

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:17.239
whether there were clouds or not,

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.407
because think about it:

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:23.109
If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.808
but if there are no clouds,

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:27.659
then it's actually impossible for it to rain.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.939
These images show the onset of the rains

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.794
this season in Kenya.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.830
You see that around March 6,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.935
the clouds move in and then disappear,

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:38.963
and then around the March 11,

00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:42.213
the clouds really move in.

00:03:42.213 --> 00:03:45.140
That, and those clouds,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.028
were the onset of the rains this year.

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.715
This satellite covers the whole of Africa

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.632
and goes back as far as 1984,

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.980
and that's important, because if you know

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.421
how many times a place has had a drought

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.370
in the last 30 years,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.200
you can make a pretty good estimate

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.957
what the chances are of drought in the future,

00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:07.070
and that means that you can put a price tag

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.760
on the risk of drought.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.156
The data alone isn't enough.

00:04:12.156 --> 00:04:14.641
We devise agronomic algorithms

00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:18.335
which tell us how much rainfall
a crop needs and when.

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:20.749
For example, for maize at planting,

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.144
you need to have two days of rain

00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:25.000
for farmers to plant,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.194
and then it needs to rain once every two weeks

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:29.673
for the crop to properly germinate.

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:32.998
After that, you need rain every three weeks

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.901
for the crop to form its leaves,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.667
whereas at flowering, you
need it to rain more frequently,

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.527
about once every 10 days
for the crop to form its cob.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.032
At the end of the season,

00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:46.244
you actually don't want it to rain,

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:49.795
because rains then can damage the crop.

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:53.150
Devising such a cover is difficult,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.046
but it turned out the real challenge

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:59.574
was selling insurance.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.061
We set ourselves a modest target

00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:06.061
of 500 farmers insured after our first season.

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.631
After a couple of months' intense marketing,

00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:10.450
we had signed up the grand total

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.108
of 185 farmers.

00:05:14.108 --> 00:05:17.030
I was disappointed and confounded.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.684
Everybody kept telling me that farmers

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:21.267
wanted insurance,

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:24.264
but our prime customers simply weren't buying.

00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:26.928
They were waiting to see what would happen,

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:29.677
didn't trust insurance companies,

00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:31.963
or thought, "I've managed for so many years.

00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:35.720
Why would I buy insurance now?"

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.102
Now many of you know microcredit,

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:41.596
the method of providing small loans to poor people

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:43.598
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,

00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:45.119
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.268
for his work with the Grameen Bank.

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:49.752
Turns out, selling microcredit

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:53.153
isn't the same as selling insurance.

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:57.038
For credit, a farmer needs
to earn the trust of a bank,

00:05:57.038 --> 00:06:00.982
and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.

00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:03.091
That's an attractive proposition.

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.337
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust

00:06:06.337 --> 00:06:07.879
the insurance company, and needs

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.103
to advance the insurance company money.

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:14.470
It's a very different value proposition.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.159
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.735
with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:22.288
taking up insurance in 2012,

00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:24.280
and half of that number is in one country,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.323
South Africa.

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:27.970
We tried for some years

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.421
selling insurance directly to farmers,

00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:32.420
with very high marketing cost

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.506
and very limited success.

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:37.460
Then we realized that there were many organizations

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.169
working with farmers:

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.606
seed companies, microfinance institutions,

00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:45.552
mobile phone companies,

00:06:45.552 --> 00:06:46.874
government agencies.

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:49.624
They were all providing loans to farmers,

00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:52.246
and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:54.346
the farmer would say,

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.498
"But what if it doesn't rain?

00:06:56.498 --> 00:06:59.965
How do you expect me to repay my loan?"

00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:02.042
Many of these organizations

00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:03.660
were taking on the risk themselves,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.628
simply hoping that that year,

00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:07.990
the worst wouldn't happen.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.996
Most of the organizations, however,

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.319
were limiting their growth in agriculture.

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.991
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.714
These organizations became our customers,

00:07:18.714 --> 00:07:21.913
and when combining credit and insurance,

00:07:21.913 --> 00:07:24.632
interesting things can happen.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:28.020
Let me tell you one more story.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.870
At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.869
the rains started, and they started early,

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:37.940
and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.506
because it usually means that
the season is going to be good.

00:07:41.506 --> 00:07:44.262
So they took out loans and planted.

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:45.752
For the next three weeks,

00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:48.060
there wasn't a single drop of rain,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.624
and the crops that had germinated so well

00:07:50.624 --> 00:07:53.937
shriveled and died.

00:07:53.937 --> 00:07:56.692
We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:57.812
that had provided those loans

00:07:57.812 --> 00:08:01.360
to about 6,000 farmers in that area,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.650
and we called them up and said,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.350
"Look, we know about the drought.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.014
We've got you.

00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:10.327
We'll give you 200,000 Euros
at the end of the season."

00:08:10.327 --> 00:08:12.126
They said, "Wow, that's great,

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:14.252
but that'll be late.

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:16.435
Could you give us the money now?

00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:18.865
Then these farmers can still replant

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:22.442
and can get a harvest this season."

00:08:22.442 --> 00:08:24.523
So we convinced our insurance partners,

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:27.898
and later that April, these farmers replanted.

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:30.692
We took the idea of replanting to a seed company

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:32.802
and convinced them to price the cost of insurance

00:08:32.802 --> 00:08:34.941
into every bag of seed,

00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:36.920
and in every bag, we packed a card

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.494
that had a number on it,

00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:40.476
and when the farmers would open the card,

00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:42.477
they'd text in that number,

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:43.850
and that number would actually help us

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.225
to locate the farmer

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.349
and allocate them to a satellite pixel.

00:08:48.349 --> 00:08:50.891
A satellite would then measure the rainfall

00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:52.424
for the next three weeks,

00:08:52.424 --> 00:08:54.154
and if it didn't rain,

00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.560
we'd replace their seed.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.800
One of the first —

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.023
(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:07.180
One of the first beneficiaries
of this replanting guarantee

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.396
was Bosco Mwinyi.

00:09:09.396 --> 00:09:12.087
We visited his farm later that August,

00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:15.643
and I wish I could show you the smile on his face

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:18.107
when he showed us his harvest,

00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:19.740
because it warmed my heart

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.678
and it made me realize why selling insurance

00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.388
can be a good thing.

00:09:24.388 --> 00:09:25.936
But you know, he insisted

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:28.890
that we get his whole harvest in the picture,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.753
so we had to zoom out a lot.

00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:35.982
Insurance secured his harvest that season,

00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:38.502
and I believe that today,

00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:41.685
we have all the tools to enable African farmers

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:44.452
to take control of their own destiny.

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:45.951
No more years of the cup.

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.289
Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.945
the year of the insurance,

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.648
or the year of the great harvest.

00:09:54.648 --> 00:09:57.850
Thank you.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.464
(Applause)
