00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.160
The first patient to ever be 
treated with an antibiotic

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.693
was a policeman in Oxford.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:19.800
On his day off from work,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.173
he was scratched by a rose thorn
while working in the garden.

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:26.848
That small scratch became infected.

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:29.163
Over the next few days, 
his head was swollen

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:30.884
with abscesses,

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.167
and in fact his eye was so infected

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.070
that they had to take it out,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.050
and by February of 1941,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.487
this poor man was on the verge of dying.

00:00:40.487 --> 00:00:43.685
He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.991
and fortunately for him,

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:47.041
a small team of doctors

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.930
led by a Dr. Howard Florey

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.997
had managed to synthesize

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:53.820
a very small amount of penicillin,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.901
a drug that had been discovered

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.223
12 years before by Alexander Fleming

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:01.930
but had never actually been 
used to treat a human,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.340
and indeed no one even 
knew if the drug would work,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.980
if it was full of impurities 
that would kill the patient,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.894
but Florey and his team figured

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:11.616
if they had to use it, 
they might as well use it

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:14.181
on someone who was going to die anyway.

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.836
So they gave Albert Alexander,

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:20.715
this Oxford policeman, the drug,

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:23.132
and within 24 hours,

00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:25.394
he started getting better.

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:29.370
His fever went down, 
his appetite came back.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.683
Second day, he was doing much better.

00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:33.921
They were starting to 
run out of penicillin,

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.983
so what they would do 
was run with his urine

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:38.833
across the road to re-synthesize 
the penicillin from his urine

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.768
and give it back to him,

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.016
and that worked.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:44.496
Day four, well on the way to recovery.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.134
This was a miracle.

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:50.370
Day five, they ran out of penicillin,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.637
and the poor man died.

00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:55.350
So that story didn't end that well,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.700
but fortunately for 
millions of other people,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.706
like this child who was treated 
again in the early 1940s,

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:05.740
who was again dying of a sepsis,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.890
and within just six days, you can see,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.243
recovered thanks to this 
wonder drug, penicillin.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:14.201
Millions have lived,

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.785
and global health has been transformed.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:20.578
Now, antibiotics have been used

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:23.705
for patients like this,

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:25.842
but they've also been 
used rather frivolously

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:27.586
in some instances,

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:29.949
for treating someone 
with just a cold or the flu,

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.423
which they might not have 
responded to an antibiotic,

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:36.161
and they've also been 
used in large quantities

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.803
sub-therapeutically, which
means in small concentrations,

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:42.986
to make chicken and hogs grow faster.

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:46.552
Just to save a few pennies
on the price of meat,

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:49.252
we've spent a lot of 
antibiotics on animals,

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.614
not for treatment, not for sick animals,

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:54.730
but primarily for growth promotion.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.587
Now, what did that lead us to?

00:02:57.587 --> 00:03:00.298
Basically, the massive use of antibiotics

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:01.783
around the world

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:05.587
has imposed such large
selection pressure on bacteria

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.240
that resistance is now a problem,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.010
because we've now selected for just

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.985
the resistant bacteria.

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:14.825
And I'm sure you've all read
about this in the newspapers,

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.629
you've seen this in every magazine

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.528
that you come across,

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:20.328
but I really want you to appreciate

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:22.499
the significance of this problem.

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:23.950
This is serious.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.766
The next slide I'm about to show you is 
of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:31.154
Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:32.487
and carbapenem is pretty much

00:03:32.487 --> 00:03:34.265
the strongest class of antibiotics

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:36.721
that we can throw at this bug.

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.990
And you can see in 1999

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.185
this is the pattern of resistance,

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.218
mostly under about 10 percent
across the United States.

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:49.215
Now watch what happens 
when we play the video.

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.516
So I don't know where you live,

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:03.418
but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:05.915
than it was in 1999,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:09.886
and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.573
It's a global issue

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:14.001
affecting both rich and poor countries,

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:16.242
and at the heart of it, 
you might say, well,

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:18.170
isn't this really just a medical issue?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.731
If we taught doctors how not 
to use antibiotics as much,

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:23.676
if we taught patients how 
not to demand antibiotics,

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:25.131
perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.120
and maybe the pharmaceutical companies

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.875
should be working harder to develop

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:30.511
more antibiotics.

00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:33.890
Now, it turns out that there's something 
fundamental about antibiotics

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.673
which makes it different from other drugs,

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:37.694
which is that if I misuse antibiotics

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.431
or I use antibiotics,

00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:43.291
not only am I affected but 
others are affected as well,

00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.629
in the same way as if I 
choose to drive to work

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.268
or take a plane to go somewhere,

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:50.242
that the costs I impose on others

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:52.682
through global climate change go everywhere,

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:55.455
and I don't necessarily take
these costs into consideration.

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.334
This is what economists might 
call a problem of the commons,

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.314
and the problem of the commons is exactly

00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.739
what we face in the case 
of antibiotics as well:

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:04.889
that we don't consider —

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.891
and we, including individuals, patients,

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.050
hospitals, entire health systems —

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.198
do not consider the costs 
that they impose on others

00:05:13.198 --> 00:05:15.554
by the way antibiotics are actually used.

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:17.959
Now, that's a problem that's similar

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.941
to another area that we all know about,

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:21.870
which is of fuel use and energy,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.369
and of course energy use

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:26.451
both depletes energy as well as

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.713
leads to local pollution 
and climate change.

00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:31.523
And typically, in the case of energy,

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:33.831
there are two ways in which
you can deal with the problem.

00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:37.576
One is, we can make better
use of the oil that we have,

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:39.691
and that's analogous to making better use

00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.239
of existing antibiotics,

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:42.930
and we can do this in a number of ways

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.160
that we'll talk about in a second,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.847
but the other option is the 
"drill, baby, drill" option,

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:53.038
which in the case of antibiotics 
is to go find new antibiotics.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.100
Now, these are not separate.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.522
They're related, because if we invest heavily

00:05:58.522 --> 00:06:00.806
in new oil wells,

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:03.760
we reduce the incentives 
for conservation of oil

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.286
in the same way that's going 
to happen for antibiotics.

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:08.454
The reverse is also going 
to happen, which is that

00:06:08.454 --> 00:06:10.792
if we use our antibiotics appropriately,

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:13.573
we don't necessarily have 
to make the investments

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.750
in new drug development.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.466
And if you thought that these two were entirely,

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:20.288
fully balanced between these two options,

00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:22.471
you might consider the fact that

00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:24.743
this is really a game that we're playing.

00:06:24.743 --> 00:06:27.184
The game is really one of coevolution,

00:06:27.184 --> 00:06:30.116
and coevolution is, in 
this particular picture,

00:06:30.116 --> 00:06:32.472
between cheetahs and gazelles.

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:34.090
Cheetahs have evolved to run faster,

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.667
because if they didn't run faster,

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:37.613
they wouldn't get any lunch.

00:06:37.613 --> 00:06:40.300
Gazelles have evolved to run faster because

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.509
if they don't run faster, they would be lunch.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.395
Now, this is the game we're
playing against the bacteria,

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:48.452
except we're not the cheetahs,

00:06:48.452 --> 00:06:49.929
we're the gazelles,

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.716
and the bacteria would,

00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:54.549
just in the course of this little talk,

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:55.975
would have had kids and grandkids

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.360
and figured out how to be resistant

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.834
just by selection and trial and error,

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:02.746
trying it over and over again.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:06.518
Whereas how do we stay 
ahead of the bacteria?

00:07:06.518 --> 00:07:08.572
We have drug discovery processes,

00:07:08.572 --> 00:07:10.202
screening molecules,

00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:11.930
we have clinical trials,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.078
and then, when we think we have a drug,

00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:17.823
then we have the FDA regulatory process.

00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:20.001
And once we go through all of that,

00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:22.266
then we try to stay one step ahead

00:07:22.266 --> 00:07:24.562
of the bacteria.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:27.339
Now, this is clearly not a 
game that can be sustained,

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:28.476
or one that we can win

00:07:28.476 --> 00:07:30.313
by simply innovating to stay ahead.

00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:33.618
We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,

00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:37.300
and there are ideas that we 
can borrow from energy

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.070
that are helpful in thinking about

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.607
how we might want to do this in the case

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:42.153
of antibiotics as well.

00:07:42.153 --> 00:07:44.393
Now, if you think about how we deal with

00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:45.816
energy pricing, for instance,

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.665
we consider emissions taxes,

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:50.249
which means we're imposing 
the costs of pollution

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:53.080
on people who actually use that energy.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.060
We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.771
and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics

00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:01.172
actually get used appropriately.

00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:03.200
There are clean energy subsidies,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.255
which are to switch to fuels
which don't pollute as much

00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:09.100
or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.960
Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.220
to move away from using antibiotics,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.936
and if you think about it, what are 
good substitutes for antibiotics?

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:20.100
Well, turns out that anything that reduces

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.343
the need for the antibiotic would really work,

00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:25.485
so that could include improving
hospital infection control

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:28.380
or vaccinating people,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.677
particularly against 
the seasonal influenza.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.208
And the seasonal flu is probably

00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:36.212
the biggest driver of antibiotic use,

00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:39.131
both in this country as well
as in many other countries,

00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:41.151
and that could really help.

00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:45.254
A third option might include
something like tradeable permits.

00:08:45.254 --> 00:08:49.500
And these seem like faraway scenarios,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.927
but if you consider the 
fact that we might not

00:08:51.927 --> 00:08:55.310
have antibiotics for many 
people who have infections,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.547
we might consider the fact that we might

00:08:57.547 --> 00:08:59.858
want to allocate who actually gets to use

00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.572
some of these antibiotics over others,

00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:05.898
and some of these might have to
be on the basis of clinical need,

00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:07.833
but also on the basis of pricing.

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.743
And certainly consumer education works.

00:09:09.743 --> 00:09:12.344
Very often, people overuse antibiotics

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.621
or prescribe too much without necessarily

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.227
knowing that they do so,

00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:17.658
and feedback mechanisms

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.560
have been found to be useful,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.489
both on energy —

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:23.029
When you tell someone that they're using

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.946
a lot of energy during peak hour,

00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:26.416
they tend to cut back,

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:28.183
and the same sort of example has been performed

00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:29.993
even in the case of antibiotics.

00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:31.974
A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up

00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:36.166
on a chart the names of surgeons

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:38.385
in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used

00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:40.329
in the previous month,

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.671
and this was purely an 
informational feedback,

00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:43.854
there was no shaming,

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:45.989
but essentially that provided 
some information back

00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:47.943
to surgeons that maybe they could rethink

00:09:47.943 --> 00:09:50.172
how they were using antibiotics.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.186
Now, there's a lot that can be done

00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:54.335
on the supply side as well.

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:56.112
If you look at the price of penicillin,

00:09:56.112 --> 00:09:57.763
the cost per day is about 10 cents.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.521
It's a fairly cheap drug.

00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:01.658
If you take drugs that have
been introduced since then —

00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:04.302
linezolid or daptomycin —

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:06.180
those are significantly more expensive,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.631
so to a world that has been used to
paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.163
the idea of paying 180 dollars per day

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:15.730
seems like a lot.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.717
But what is that really telling us?

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.682
That price is telling us

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:21.580
that we should no longer

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.697
take cheap, effective 
antibiotics as a given

00:10:25.697 --> 00:10:27.464
into the foreseeable future,

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:29.994
and that price is a signal to us

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:31.603
that perhaps we need to be paying

00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:34.156
much more attention to conservation.

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:36.860
That price is also a signal

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.735
that maybe we need to start
looking at other technologies,

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:42.387
in the same way that 
gasoline prices are a signal

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:44.977
and an impetus, to, say,

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.845
the development of electric cars.

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:48.622
Prices are important signals

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:50.208
and we need to pay attention,

00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:52.660
but we also need to consider the fact that

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.912
although these high prices
seem unusual for antibiotics,

00:10:56.912 --> 00:10:59.151
they're nothing compared to the price per day

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:00.535
of some cancer drugs,

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:03.905
which might save a patient's life only
for a few months or perhaps a year,

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:05.675
whereas antibiotics would potentially

00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:07.501
save a patient's life forever.

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:08.820
So this is going to involve

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.782
a whole new paradigm shift,

00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:12.638
and it's also a scary shift because

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.967
in many parts of this country,

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.711
in many parts of the world,

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:18.780
the idea of paying 200 dollars

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.671
for a day of antibiotic treatment

00:11:21.671 --> 00:11:24.213
is simply unimaginable.

00:11:24.213 --> 00:11:25.947
So we need to think about that.

00:11:25.947 --> 00:11:27.760
Now, there are backstop options,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.436
which is other alternative technologies

00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:31.630
that people are working on.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.282
It includes bacteriophages, probiotics,

00:11:34.282 --> 00:11:38.330
quorum sensing, synbiotics.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.369
Now, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,

00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:43.979
and they will become even more lucrative

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:47.060
when the price of new 
antibiotics starts going higher,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.957
and we've seen that the
market does actually respond,

00:11:49.957 --> 00:11:51.965
and the government is now considering

00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:55.732
ways of subsidizing new 
antibiotics and development.

00:11:55.732 --> 00:11:57.455
But there are challenges here.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.030
We don't want to just throw money at a problem.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.549
What we want to be able to do

00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:02.828
is invest in new antibiotics

00:12:02.828 --> 00:12:05.804
in ways that actually encourage

00:12:05.804 --> 00:12:08.824
appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:11.287
and that really is the challenge here.

00:12:11.287 --> 00:12:13.616
Now, going back to these technologies,

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:15.979
you all remember the line from that famous

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:18.205
dinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:21.524
So it's not as if these are 
permanent solutions.

00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:25.610
We really have to remember that,
whatever the technology might be,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.486
that nature will find some 
way to work around it.

00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:30.557
You might think, well, 
this is just a problem

00:12:30.557 --> 00:12:33.301
just with antibiotics and with bacteria,

00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:35.247
but it turns out that we 
have the exact same

00:12:35.247 --> 00:12:37.981
identical problem in 
many other fields as well,

00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:40.933
with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:44.495
which is a serious problem 
in India and South Africa.

00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:46.282
Thousands of patients are dying because

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:48.116
the second-line drugs are so expensive,

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:50.343
and in some instances, even those don't work

00:12:50.343 --> 00:12:52.413
and you have XDR TB.

00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:54.224
Viruses are becoming resistant.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:57.390
Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.173
Right now, much of the world depends on

00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:02.870
one drug, artemisinin drugs,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.826
essentially to treat malaria.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.413
Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,

00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:09.767
and if this were to become widespread,

00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:11.115
that puts at risk

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:14.006
the single drug that we have to 
treat malaria around the world

00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:17.220
in a way that's currently 
safe and efficacious.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.018
Mosquitos develop resistance.

00:13:19.018 --> 00:13:21.255
If you have kids, you probably 
know about head lice,

00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:22.968
and if you're from New York City,

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.701
I understand that the 
specialty there is bedbugs.

00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:27.956
So those are also resistant.

00:13:27.956 --> 00:13:30.835
And we have to bring an
example from across the pond.

00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:33.190
Turns out that rats are 
also resistant to poisons.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.891
Now, what's common 
to all of these things is

00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.597
the idea that we've had these technologies

00:13:38.597 --> 00:13:43.218
to control nature only for 
the last 70, 80 or 100 years

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.246
and essentially in a blink,

00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:48.797
we have squandered our ability to control,

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:51.288
because we have not recognized

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:54.100
that natural selection and 
evolution was going to find

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.274
a way to get back,

00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:57.323
and we need to completely rethink

00:13:57.323 --> 00:13:59.666
how we're going to use

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:02.760
measures to control biological organisms,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.224
and rethink how we incentivize

00:14:06.224 --> 00:14:08.450
the development, introduction,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.118
in the case of antibiotics prescription,

00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:14.890
and use of these valuable resources.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.270
And we really now need to 
start thinking about them

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.228
as natural resources.

00:14:19.228 --> 00:14:21.466
And so we stand at a crossroads.

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:24.625
An option is to go through that rethinking

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.438
and carefully consider incentives

00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:28.992
to change how we do business.

00:14:28.992 --> 00:14:31.253
The alternative is

00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:34.336
a world in which even a blade of grass

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:36.765
is a potentially lethal weapon.

00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:38.565
Thank you.

00:14:38.565 --> 00:14:41.300
(Applause)
