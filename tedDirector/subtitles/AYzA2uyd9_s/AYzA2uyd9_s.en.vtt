00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.956
In the last couple of years,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.716
I have produced what I call
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.996
32 short films and counting
about dead malls.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.436
Now, for those of you who are
not familiar with what a dead mall is,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.876
it's basically a shopping mall

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.380
that has fallen into hard times.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.796
So it either has few shops
and fewer shoppers,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.060
or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.316
No sale at Penny's.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.156
(Laughter)

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.556
I started producing this series

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.900
in early 2015

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.916
after going through
kind of a dark period in my life

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.436
where I just didn't want
to create films anymore.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.700
I put my camera away

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.020
and I just stopped.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.340
So in 2015, I decided to make
a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.396
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.300
I should know because
I was there on opening day.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.716
I was there with my family,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.900
along with every other
family in Baltimore,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.476
and you had to drive around

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.196
for 45 minutes

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.996
just to find a parking spot.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.556
So if you can imagine,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.500
that's not happening at the malls today.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.636
My first mall job that I had as a teenager

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.196
was at a sporting goods store
called Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.436
Maybe you remember.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.356
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.956
You guys remember that?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.876
(Laughter)

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.500
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.716
I worked in a leather goods store,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.620
and I also worked in a video store,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.500
and not being one who was
very fond of the retail arts --

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.356
(Laughter)

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.236
I got fired from every single job.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.076
(Laughter)

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
In between these low-paying retail jobs,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.036
I did what any normal teenager did

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.260
in the 1990s.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.940
I shoplifted.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.115
I'm just kidding.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.036
I hung out with my friends at the mall.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.596
(Laughter)

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.636
Everyone's like, "Oh my God,
what kind of talk is this?"

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.900
(Laughter)

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.236
Hanging out at the mall could be fun,
but it could be really lame, too,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.716
like sharing a cigarette
with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.876
who has put on
black lipstick for the night

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860
while you're on your break
from your crappy minimum wage job.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.500
As I stand here today,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.620
Owings Mills has been gutted

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.622
and it's ready for the wrecking ball.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.956
The last time I was there,
it was in the evening,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.900
and it was about three days
before they closed the mall for good.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.916
And you kind of felt --

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.956
they never announced the mall was closing,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.596
but you had this sort of feeling,
this ominous feeling,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.396
that something big was going to happen,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.956
like it was the end of the road.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.516
It was a very creepy walk
through the mall.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.780
Let me show you.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.180
(Music)

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.236
So when I started producing
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.996
I put the videos up onto YouTube,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.156
and while I thought they were interesting,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.756
frankly I didn't think others
would share the enthusiasm

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.220
for such a drab and depressing topic.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.436
But apparently I was wrong,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.516
because a lot of people
started to comment.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.420
And at first the comments were like --

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.316
basically like, "Oh my God,
that's the mall from my childhood.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.540
What happened?"

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.940
And then I would get comments
from people who were like,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.620
"There's a dead mall in my town.
You should come and film it."

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.876
So I started to travel around
the mid-Atlantic region

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.516
filming these dead malls.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.740
Some were open.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.900
Some were abandoned.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.356
It was kind of always hard
to get into the ones that were abandoned,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.876
but I somehow always found a way in.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.276
(Laughter)

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.356
The malls that are still open,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.996
they always do this weird thing --
like the dead malls.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.556
They'll have three stores left,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.596
but they try to spruce it up

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.956
to make it appear
like things are on the up-and-up.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.836
For example,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.876
you'll have an empty store

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.676
and they bring the gate down.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.876
So at Owings Mills, for example,
they put this tarp over the gate.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.156
Right?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.756
And it's got a stock photo

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.436
of a woman who is so happy

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.076
and she's holding a blouse,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.316
and she's like --

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.260
(Laughter)

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.596
And then there's a guy
standing next to her, with, like,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.876
an espresso cup, and he's like --

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.676
(Laughter)

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.460
And it says, "What brings you today?"

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.356
(Laughter)

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.556
I wanted to be scared and depressed.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.780
Thank you.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.900
So the comments just kept pouring in

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.116
on the videos,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.300
from all over the country,
and then all over the world.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.436
And I started to think,
this could really be something,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.756
but I had to get creative,
because I'm like,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.596
how long are people going to sit and watch
me waddling through an empty mall?

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.380
(Laughter)

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.476
So the original episodes
I filmed with an iPhone.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.300
So I'd walk through the mall
with an iPhone, and, you know.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.996
Like that.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.476
(Laughter)

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.316
And security -- because malls,
they don't like photography --

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.076
so the security would come up and be like,
"Put that away," and I'm like, "OK."

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.436
So I had to get creative and sneaky,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.036
so I started using a hidden camera
and different techniques

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.676
to get the footage that I needed,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.836
and basically what I wanted to do

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.076
was make the video

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.436
like it was a first-person experience,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.500
like you are sitting --

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.556
put your headphones on
watching the screen --

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.476
it's like, you're there in the video,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.220
like a video game, basically.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.796
I also started to use music,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.076
collaborating with artists
who create music called vaporwave.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.036
And vaporwave is a music genre

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.036
that emerged in the early 2010s
among internet communities.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.356
Here's an example.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.700
(Music)

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.796
That's by an artist named Disconscious

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.996
from an album he did
called "Hologram Plaza."

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.676
So if you look that up,
you can hear more of those tunes.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.380
Vaporwave is more than an art form.
It's like a movement.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.340
It's nihilistic, it's angsty,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.676
but it's somehow comforting.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.916
The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing
with things you can't do anything about,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.076
like no jobs, or sitting in your parents'
basement eating ramen noodles.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.276
Vaporwave came out of this generation's
desire to express their hopelessness,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.036
the same way that
the pre-internet generation did

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.340
sitting around in the food court.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.380
One of my favorite malls

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.780
I've been to

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.436
is in Corpus Christi,
and it's called the Sunrise Mall.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.276
When I was a kid,

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.356
my favorite thing to do was watch movies,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.316
and I used to watch movies
over and over and over again.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.900
And one of my favorite films
was "The Legend of Billie Jean."

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.196
Now, for those of you who have seen
"The Legend of Billie Jean,"

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.556
you'll know that it's a great film.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.796
I love it.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.725
And Helen Slater and Christian Slater --

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.876
and if you didn't know,
they are not related.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.076
Many people thought that they
were brother and sister. They're not.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.476
But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used
in the film as a filming location.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.036
The mall is exactly the same
as it was in 1984.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.796
We're talking 32 years later.
Let me show you.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.316
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean
running across the fountain,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.180
being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.020
And she jumps over here.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.580
And you can see the shot right here
is what it looks like today.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.836
It's pretty incredible.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.900
I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.236
And there they are
falling in the fountain,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.596
and she runs up the stairs.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.460
This is a nice shot
of the whole thing here.

00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:55.036
Dan Bell: I love that so much.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.420
(Laughter)

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.556
I always think in my head,
if I owned a dead mall --

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.236
why don't they embrace their vintage look?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.460
Put in a bar,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.756
like, put vegan food in the food court

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.876
and invite millennials and hipsters

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.676
to come and drink and eat,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.636
and I guarantee you within three weeks

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.796
H&amp;M and Levi's will be banging
on the door trying to get space.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.556
I don't know why they don't do this,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.956
but apparently,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.436
it's only in my mind, it goes all day.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.820
(Laughter)

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.116
Anyway, in closing --

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.180
(Laughter)

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.300
When they first asked me to do this talk,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.660
I said,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.956
"Do you have the right person?"

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.260
(Laughter)

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.116
These talks are supposed
to be kind of inspiring and --

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.780
(Laughter)

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.236
I remembered something, though.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.780
I put my camera down
three or four years ago,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.276
and it took going to these malls

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.940
for me to be inspired again.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.116
And to see my audience

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.036
and people from all over the world
writing me and saying,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.276
"God, I love your videos,"

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.220
is incredible.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.796
I don't know how to even explain it,

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.196
as an artist,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.116
how fulfilling that is.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.260
If you would have told me a year ago

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.260
that I would be standing on this stage

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.156
talking to all of you wonderful people,

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.676
I would have never believed it.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.116
I am humbled

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.420
and so appreciative.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.196
Thank you very much.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.620
