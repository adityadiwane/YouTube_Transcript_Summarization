00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:17.010
Cities are like siblings
in a large polygamous family.

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:22.572
Each one has a unique personality
and is headed in a distinct direction.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.445
But they all have somewhat shared origins.

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:29.544
Sometimes I think postcolonial cities
are like the children

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:31.267
of the two least-favorite wives,

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:32.875
who are constantly being asked,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.102
"Ah, why can't you be
more like your sister?"

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:36.736
(Laughter)

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.712
The "why" of cities is largely the same,
no matter where they are:

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:46.432
an advantageous location that makes
trade and administration possible;

00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:48.648
the potential for scalable opportunities

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:51.049
for the skilled and unskilled alike;

00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:54.092
a popular willingness
to be in constant flux

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:55.869
and, of course, resilience.

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:59.418
The "how" of cities, however,
is a whole other story.

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.698
How are they run?

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.515
How do they grow?

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.417
How do they decide who belongs
and who doesn't?

00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:09.349
Lagos is my home.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.031
You can always find the Nigerians

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.285
by following the noise
and the dancing, right?

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:15.445
(Laughter)

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.309
Like any major city,
that place is a lot of things,

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.632
many of which are highly contradictory.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.466
Our public transportation
doesn't quite work,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.645
so we have these privately owned
bright yellow buses

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.704
that regularly cause accidents.

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:34.902
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained
and often flooded roads.

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:38.377
Street evangelism is only
slightly less ubiquitous

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.865
than street harassment.

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:43.747
Sex workers sometimes
have two degrees, a bank job

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.579
and a prominent role in church.

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:46.607
(Laughter)

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:47.793
On any given day,

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:51.146
there can be either a party
or a burned body

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.565
in the middle of a street.

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:57.325
There is so much that is possible in Lagos

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.539
and so much that isn't,

00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:01.776
and very often the difference
between possibility and impossibility

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.414
is simply who you are,

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:05.957
and if you're lucky enough,
who you're connected to.

00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:08.861
Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:13.013
determined by ethnic origin,
sexual orientation, gender,

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:16.372
but most visibly and often most violently,

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:17.705
class.

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:20.913
Before Nigeria became a country,

00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:24.848
fisherpeople from the inland creeks
started to come down the Lagos lagoon

00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:27.246
and establish villages along the coast.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.274
About 60 years later, my grandfather,
Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:33.820
also arrived in Lagos.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.903
Like me, he was an alumnus
of the University of Ibadan,

00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:41.462
a young member of the educated elite
in the independence era.

00:02:42.082 --> 00:02:45.675
Over time, he built an illustrious career
as a land surveyor,

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.765
mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.031
when they were just waist-high wild grass.

00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:52.579
He died when I was nine.

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:56.390
And by that time, my family,
like the families of those fisherpeople,

00:02:56.414 --> 00:02:57.960
knew Lagos as home.

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.184
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.678
"Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,"

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:08.417
which can be translated to mean
that Lagos will welcome anyone.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.776
But that saying is becoming
less and less true.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:15.929
Many Lagosians, including
the descendants of those fisherpeople

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:18.305
who arrived generations
before my grandfather,

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.043
are now being pushed out

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.770
to make room for an emergent city

00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:24.389
that has been described
as "the new Dubai."

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:29.427
You see, Lagos inspires big dreams,
even in its leaders,

00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:32.135
and successive governments
have declared aspirations

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.962
towards a megacity
where poverty does not exist.

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:39.586
Unfortunately, instead of focusing
on the eradication of poverty

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.113
as you would expect,

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:44.670
the strategy of choice focuses
on eliminating the poor.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.195
Last October, the Governor announced plans

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.743
to demolish every single
waterfront settlement in Lagos.

00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:56.258
There are more than 40
of these indigenous communities

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:57.444
all over the city,

00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:59.584
with over 300,000 people living in them.

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.247
Otodo Gbame,

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.237
a hundred-year-old fishing village

00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:07.195
with a population about
three-quarters that of Monaco

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.856
and similar potential
for beachfront luxury --

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.913
(Laughter)

00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:12.902
was one of the first to be targeted.

00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:17.891
I first heard of Otodo Gbame
after the demolition started.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:22.797
When I visited in November 2016,
I met Magdalene Aiyefoju.

00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:25.559
She is a now-homeless woman

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.918
whose surname means, "the world is blind."

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:33.232
Magdalene's son Basil
was one of over 20 people

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:35.081
who were shot, drowned

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.249
or presumed dead in that land grab.

00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:42.961
Standing outside her shelter,
I saw the two white-sand football fields

00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:44.475
where Basil used to play.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.109
Spread all around us were the ruins
of schools, churches,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.253
a primary health center, shops,

00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:52.819
thousands of homes.

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:57.201
Young children enthusiastically helped
to put up shelters,

00:04:57.225 --> 00:05:00.280
and about 5,000 of the residents,
with nowhere else to go,

00:05:00.304 --> 00:05:01.727
simply stayed put.

00:05:02.658 --> 00:05:04.076
And then in April,

00:05:04.773 --> 00:05:06.886
state security personnel came back.

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:11.530
This time, they cleared
the community out completely,

00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:14.375
with beatings, bullets and fire.

00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:20.273
As I speak, there are construction crews
preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches

00:05:20.297 --> 00:05:23.485
for anyone who can afford
a multi-million-dollar view.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:26.883
The new development
is called "Periwinkle Estate."

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:35.099
Forced evictions are incredibly violent
and, of course, unconstitutional.

00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:38.416
And yet, they happen so often
in so many of our cities,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.185
because the first thing we are taught
to forget about poor people

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:43.632
is that they are people.

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:47.795
We believe that a home is a thing
a person absolutely has a right to,

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.793
unless the person is poor
and the home is built a certain way

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:52.166
in a certain neighborhood.

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:56.149
But there is no single definition
of the word "home."

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.511
After all, what is a slum
besides an organic response

00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:03.621
to acute housing deficits
and income inequality?

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.814
And what is a shanty if not a person
making a home for themselves

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:09.404
against all odds?

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:13.527
Slums are an imperfect housing solution,

00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.244
but they are also prime examples
of the innovation, adaptability

00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:19.994
and resilience at the foundation --

00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:21.405
and the heart --

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:23.094
of every functional city.

00:06:24.303 --> 00:06:26.654
You don't need to be the new Dubai

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.248
when you're already Lagos.

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:35.358
(Applause)

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.817
We have our own identity,

00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:40.541
our own rhythm,

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:42.860
and as anyone who knows
Lagos can tell you,

00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:46.420
poor Lagosians are very often
the source of the city's character.

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:49.677
Without its poor, Lagos would not
be known for its music

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.979
or its endless energy

00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:54.652
or even the fact that you can buy
an ice cold drink or a puppy

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:56.079
through your car window.

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:58.711
(Laughter)

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.640
The conditions that cause us
to define certain neighborhoods as slums

00:07:03.664 --> 00:07:05.635
can be effectively improved,

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.722
but not without recognizing
the humanity and the agency

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:10.286
of the people living in them.

00:07:11.012 --> 00:07:14.038
In Lagos, where public goods
are rarely publicly available,

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:17.664
slum dwellers are often at the forefront
of innovating solutions.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.922
After being disconnected
from the grid for months

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:24.211
because the power company
couldn't figure out how to collect bills,

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.696
one settlement designed a system
that collectivized remittances

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.349
and got everyone cheaper rates
into the bargain.

00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.634
Another settlement created
a reform program

00:07:33.658 --> 00:07:36.412
that hires local bad boys as security.

00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:38.562
They know every trick and every hideout,

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:42.016
so now troublemakers are more likely
to get caught and reported to police

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.367
and fewer of the youth end up
engaging in criminal activity.

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:48.253
Yet another settlement recently completed

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:51.391
a flood-safe, eco-friendly
communal toilet system.

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:54.986
Models like these are being
adopted across Lagos.

00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:59.693
Informal settlements are incorrectly
named as the problem.

00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:03.799
In fact, the real problems
are the factors that create them,

00:08:03.823 --> 00:08:05.756
like the entrenchment of poverty,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.975
social exclusion

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.426
and state failures.

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:11.828
When our governments
frame slums as threats

00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:14.742
in order to justify violent land grabs
or forced evictions,

00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:17.731
they're counting on those of us
who live in formal housing

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:21.553
to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:24.473
Rather, we must remind them

00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:27.118
that governments exist to serve
not only those who build

00:08:27.142 --> 00:08:28.645
and live in luxury homes,

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.046
but also those who clean and guard them.

00:08:32.043 --> 00:08:33.202
Our --

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:36.588
(Applause)

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.837
our realities may differ,

00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:41.843
but our rights don't.

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.614
The Lagos state government,

00:08:45.638 --> 00:08:47.561
like far too many on our continent,

00:08:47.585 --> 00:08:50.258
pays lip service to ideas of inclusion,

00:08:50.282 --> 00:08:53.329
while acting as though
progress can only be achieved

00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:56.785
by the erasure, exploitation
and even elimination of groups

00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:58.568
it considers expendable.

00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:03.195
People living with disabilities
who hawk or beg on Lagos streets

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:05.414
are rounded up, extorted

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:06.651
and detained.

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.393
Women in low-income
neighborhoods are picked up

00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.912
and charged with prostitution,

00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:13.820
regardless of what they actually
do for a living.

00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:18.363
Gay citizens are scapegoated
to distract from real political problems.

00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:23.355
But people, like cities, are resilient,

00:09:23.912 --> 00:09:27.317
and no amount of legislation
or intimidation or violence

00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:29.276
can fully eliminate any of us.

00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.766
Prostitutes, women
and women who work as prostitutes

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.301
still haven't gone extinct,

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.981
despite centuries of active suppression.

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:41.345
Queer Africans continue to exist,

00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:45.154
even though queerness is now criminalized
in most parts of the continent.

00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:49.727
And I'm fairly certain that poor people
don't generally tend to just disappear

00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:52.478
because they've been stripped
of everything they have.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:56.692
We are all already here,

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.955
and that answers the question

00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:00.784
of whether or not we belong.

00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:06.698
When those fisherpeople
started to sail down the lagoon

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.157
in search of new homes,

00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:10.244
it could not have occurred to them

00:10:10.268 --> 00:10:12.392
that the city that would
rise up around them

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:15.145
would one day insist
that they do not belong in it.

00:10:16.645 --> 00:10:18.837
I like to believe that my grandfather,

00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:20.726
in mapping new frontiers for Lagos,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.661
was trying to open it up

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:25.699
to make room for other people
to be welcomed by the city

00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:27.382
in the same way that he was.

00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:31.393
On my way here, my grandma called me

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:34.154
to remind me how proud she was,

00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:37.170
how proud [my grandfather]
and my mother would have been.

00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:40.132
I am their dreams come true.

00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:46.277
But there is no reason why their dreams --
or mine, for that matter --

00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:47.673
are allowed to come true

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.131
while those of others
are turned to nightmares.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.637
And lest we forget:

00:10:53.204 --> 00:10:55.403
the minimum requirement for a dream

00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:58.312
is a safe place to lay your head.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.615
It is too late now for Basil,

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:06.264
but not for Magdalene,

00:11:06.288 --> 00:11:08.227
not for the hundreds of thousands,

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.645
the millions still under threat in Lagos

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:12.387
or any of our cities.

00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:16.014
The world does not have to remain blind

00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:20.467
to the suffering that is created
when we deny people's humanity,

00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:23.781
or even to the incredible potential
for growth that exists

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:27.826
when we recognize and value
all contributions.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.814
We must hold our governments

00:11:31.838 --> 00:11:33.543
and ourselves

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:34.987
accountable

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:38.719
for keeping our shared cities safe
for everyone in them,

00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:42.101
because the only cities worth building --

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:46.083
indeed, the only futures
worth dreaming of --

00:11:46.107 --> 00:11:48.140
are those that include all of us,

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:51.082
no matter who we are

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:53.433
or how we make homes for ourselves.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:55.467
Thank you.

00:11:55.491 --> 00:12:00.185
(Applause)
