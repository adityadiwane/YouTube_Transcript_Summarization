00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Who are we?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
That is the big question.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
super-intelligent ape.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
This could be us.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and it's important to remember that,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
in terms of our place in the world today

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and our future on planet Earth.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
We are one species

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.330
of about five and a half thousand mammalian species

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
that exist on planet Earth today.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
that have ever lived on the planet in past times.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
We're one species out of approximately,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
that have existed over the past six to eight million years.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
And it's important to remember that,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
because the bonobos are so human,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
It's important to remember that we evolved.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.330
but we evolved from common ancestors

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.330
with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
We have a common past, and we have a common future.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
as we ourselves have today.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.330
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and it's this journey that has been the focus

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
of the past three generations of my family,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.330
of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
And this is how we look for them.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.330
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
out across vast areas of Africa,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.330
looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
I doubt many of you in the audience can see

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
the fossil that's in this picture,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
(Laughter)

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.330
and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
to begin to piece together our past.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.330
When we find a fossil, we mark it.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
We mark it with a GPS fix,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
so we could essentially put it back on the surface,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
exactly where we found it.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.330
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.330
When we then find something very important,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
like the bones of a human ancestor,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
And all the sediment is then put through these screens,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
and where we go again through it very carefully,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.330
were digging up some remains of human ancestors.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And it is one of the most special things

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
to ever do with your mother.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
(Laughter)

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
Not many people can say that.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.330
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.330
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.330
it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
or runs down to Lake Malawi.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
And the Rift Valley is a depression.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.330
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.330
carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
where your bones will be rapidly buried.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
as to bring the bones back up to the surface.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
And then you hope that one of us lot

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
will walk around and find small pieces of you.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.330
(Laughter)

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
as we do know today about our ancestors,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
because it's incredibly difficult,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.330
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.330
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.330
in the very north of our country, Kenya.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.330
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
of the animals that lived there.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.330
which represents some 20,000 square miles.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
actually lived in this region.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.330
in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
Homo erectus, up in the far right corner,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.330
lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
which I just pulled off the shelf there.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
(Laughter)

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.330
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
In fact, if you go back in time,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.330
it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
Where did these things come from?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
That's what we're still trying to find answers to,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.330
and it is important to realize that there is diversity

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.330
in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.330
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
that have been found from Lake Turkana.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
in search of human remains.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.330
fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.330
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.330
when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.330
because I was the same age that he was when he died.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.330
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.330
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.330
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.330
actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.330
members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
and couldn't get out.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
and beautifully preserved.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.330
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
walked along a small hillside

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.330
amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.330
Well, an excavation was begun immediately,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and more and more little bits of skull

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.330
started to be extracted from the sediment.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
And what was so fun about it was this:

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.330
the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and fairly recently the tree had grown up,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:09.330
but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.330
holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.330
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.330
things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
It was truly exciting.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.330
He had a body very similar to our own,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.330
and he was on the threshold of becoming human.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.330
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
started to move northwards out of Africa,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:57.330
in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.330
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
and begin its spread across the globe.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
But also, surprising finds

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:22.330
where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.330
But they lived only 18,000 years ago,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
and that is truly extraordinary to think about.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
Just to put this in terms of generations,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
because people do find it hard to think of time,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
We evolved essentially from an African stock.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.330
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.330
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.330
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
shared the planet Earth.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
The question now is, well, who are we?

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.330
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.330
(Laughter)

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:20.330
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:29.330
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.330
to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
And what is it that really makes us us?

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
I think it's our collective intelligence.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
It's our ability to write things down,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
our language and our consciousness.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:51.330
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.330
we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
has really reached unprecedented levels:

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.330
and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
And we've also managed to communicate with people

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
all over the world, from extraordinary places.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.330
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
we can talk to people about what we're doing.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.330
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.330
we have reached extraordinary numbers

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
of people on this planet.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
if you look at the fossil record,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
for about, on average, a million years at a time.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.330
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.330
yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.330
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
But what's happened is our technology

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
as anything else that's being done in the world today.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
But we have to control our numbers,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.330
because we can't really hold it together as a species.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
My father so appropriately put it,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.330
that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
that are bad for our survival as a species."

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Can we hold it together?

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.330
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
We all have an African origin.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.330
We have a common past and we share a common future.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.330
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:59.330
and we have the tools and the technology at our hands

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
to communicate what needs to be done

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.330
to hold it together today.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:14.330
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Well, to end on a very positive note,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
I think evolutionarily speaking,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.330
(Applause)
