00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:16.080
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:19.174
in a distant, distant galaxy,

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:22.552
two black holes locked into a spiral,

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.655
falling inexorably towards each other

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:26.608
and collided,

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.575
converting three Suns' worth of stuff

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.428
into pure energy in a tenth of a second.

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.801
For that brief moment in time,

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:39.950
the glow was brighter than all the stars

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:41.635
in all the galaxies

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.683
in all of the known Universe.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:45.814
It was a very

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.377
big

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.551
bang.

00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:53.111
But they didn't release
their energy in light.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:55.491
I mean, you know, they're black holes.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.070
All that energy was pumped
into the fabric of space and time itself,

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:05.707
making the Universe explode
in gravitational waves.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.825
Let me give you a sense
of the timescale at work here.

00:01:09.317 --> 00:01:11.928
1.3 billion years ago,

00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:15.067
Earth had just managed to evolve
multicellular life.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.902
Since then, Earth has made and evolved

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:25.317
corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people
and even -- God save us -- the Internet.

00:01:26.063 --> 00:01:28.578
And about 25 years ago,

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.620
a particularly audacious set of people --

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:36.023
Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne
and Ronald Drever at Caltech --

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:37.841
decided that it would be really neat

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.578
to build a giant laser detector

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.984
with which to search
for the gravitational waves

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.260
from things like colliding black holes.

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:48.414
Now, most people thought they were nuts.

00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:53.201
But enough people realized
that they were brilliant nuts

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:58.264
that the US National Science Foundation
decided to fund their crazy idea.

00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:01.633
So after decades of development,

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:04.136
construction and imagination

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.144
and a breathtaking amount of hard work,

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:11.319
they built their detector, called LIGO:

00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:15.040
The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.961
For the last several years,

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:21.584
LIGO's been undergoing
a huge expansion in its accuracy,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:24.600
a tremendous improvement
in its detection ability.

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:26.970
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:30.362
In early September of 2015,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.861
LIGO turned on for a final test run

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.739
while they sorted out
a few lingering details.

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:42.256
And on September 14 of 2015,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.771
just days after the detector
had gone live,

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:50.629
the gravitational waves
from those colliding black holes

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:52.128
passed through the Earth.

00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:55.016
And they passed through you and me.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.611
And they passed through the detector.

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:01.644
(Audio) Scott Hughes:
There's two moments in my life

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:03.359
more emotionally intense than that.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.922
One is the birth of my daughter.

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:09.033
The other is when I had to say goodbye
to my father when he was terminally ill.

00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:13.222
You know, it was the payoff
of my career, basically.

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:20.146
Everything I'd been working on --
it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:25.586
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend
and collaborator, Scott Hughes,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.801
a theoretical physicist at MIT,

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:30.610
who has been studying
gravitational waves from black holes

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:34.163
and the signals that they could impart
on observatories like LIGO,

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:36.202
for the past 23 years.

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:40.648
So let me take a moment to tell you
what I mean by a gravitational wave.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.557
A gravitational wave is a ripple

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.010
in the shape of space and time.

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.479
As the wave passes by,

00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:51.882
it stretches space and everything in it

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:53.065
in one direction,

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.080
and compresses it in the other.

00:03:55.893 --> 00:03:58.942
This has led to countless instructors
of general relativity

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.898
doing a really silly dance to demonstrate
in their classes on general relativity.

00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:05.679
"It stretches and expands,
it stretches and expands."

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.256
So the trouble with gravitational waves

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.898
is that they're very weak;
they're preposterously weak.

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:16.700
For example, the waves that hit us
on September 14 --

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:21.418
and yes, every single one of you
stretched and compressed

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.012
under the action of that wave --

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:26.639
when the waves hit, they stretched
the average person

00:04:26.663 --> 00:04:29.774
by one part in 10 to the 21.

00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:32.670
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,

00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:33.860
and a one.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.984
That's why everyone thought
the LIGO people were nuts.

00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:45.405
Even with a laser detector five kilometers
long -- and that's already crazy --

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:48.307
they would have to measure
the length of those detectors

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:53.059
to less than one thousandth
of the radius of the nucleus

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:54.241
of an atom.

00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:56.105
And that's preposterous.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.624
So towards the end
of his classic text on gravity,

00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:03.270
LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:07.495
described the hunt
for gravitational waves as follows:

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.670
He said, "The technical difficulties
to be surmounted

00:05:10.694 --> 00:05:13.007
in constructing such detectors

00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:14.296
are enormous.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:17.646
But physicists are ingenious,

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:21.408
and with the support
of a broad lay public,

00:05:21.972 --> 00:05:24.947
all obstacles will surely be overcome."

00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:29.658
Thorne published that in 1973,

00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:33.006
42 years before he succeeded.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.408
Now, coming back to LIGO,

00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:39.646
Scott likes to say that LIGO
acts like an ear

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.248
more than it does like an eye.

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.839
I want to explain what that means.

00:05:43.863 --> 00:05:46.185
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.782
that's much smaller
than the things around you,

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.305
the features on people's faces,

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:53.082
the size of your cell phone.

00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:54.789
And that's really useful,

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:58.020
because it lets you make an image
or a map of the things around you,

00:05:58.044 --> 00:06:00.432
by looking at the light
coming from different spots

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.607
in the scene about you.

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.574
Sound is different.

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:07.561
Audible sound has a wavelength
that can be up to 50 feet long.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.362
And that makes it really difficult --

00:06:09.386 --> 00:06:12.426
in fact, in practical purposes,
impossible -- to make an image

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.268
of something you really care about.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:15.632
Your child's face.

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:20.907
Instead, we use sound
to listen for features like pitch

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.049
and tone and rhythm and volume

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:27.446
to infer a story behind the sounds.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:29.919
That's Alice talking.

00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.476
That's Bob interrupting.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.750
Silly Bob.

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.854
So, the same is true
of gravitational waves.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:42.752
We can't use them to make simple images
of things out in the Universe.

00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:44.452
But by listening to changes

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:47.919
in the amplitude and frequency
of those waves,

00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:51.002
we can hear the story
that those waves are telling.

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:53.765
And at least for LIGO,

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.987
the frequencies that it can hear
are in the audio band.

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.563
So if we convert the wave patterns
into pressure waves and air, into sound,

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.899
we can literally hear
the Universe speaking to us.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:11.220
For example, listening to gravity,
just in this way,

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:13.934
can tell us a lot about the collision
of two black holes,

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.752
something my colleague Scott has spent
an awful lot of time thinking about.

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:20.247
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes
are non-spinning,

00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.016
you get a very simple chirp: whoop!

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.122
If the two bodies are spinning
very rapidly, I have that same chirp,

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:27.868
but with a modulation on top of it,

00:07:27.892 --> 00:07:30.257
so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!

00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:34.832
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin
imprinted on this waveform.

00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:38.500
AA: So on September 14, 2015,

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:41.450
a date that's definitely
going to live in my memory,

00:07:41.474 --> 00:07:43.719
LIGO heard this:

00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:45.273
[Whirring sound]

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:51.296
So if you know how to listen,
that is the sound of --

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.534
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes,
each of about 30 solar masses,

00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:56.250
that were whirling around at a rate

00:07:56.274 --> 00:07:58.815
comparable to what goes on
in your blender.

00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.133
AA: It's worth pausing here
to think about what that means.

00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:05.442
Two black holes, the densest thing
in the Universe,

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:07.646
one with a mass of 29 Suns

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.457
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:13.154
whirling around each other
100 times per second

00:08:13.178 --> 00:08:14.336
before they collide.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.073
Just imagine the power of that.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:18.057
It's fantastic.

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:21.922
And we know it because we heard it.

00:08:23.827 --> 00:08:26.207
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.

00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:30.758
It's an entirely new way
to observe the Universe

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:32.639
that we've never had before.

00:08:32.663 --> 00:08:35.727
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe

00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:37.361
and hear the invisible.

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.794
And there's a lot out there
that we can't see --

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.184
in practice or even in principle.

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:46.217
So supernova, for example:

00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:50.685
I would love to know why very massive
stars explode in supernovae.

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:51.860
They're very useful;

00:08:51.884 --> 00:08:54.228
we've learned a lot
about the Universe from them.

00:08:54.252 --> 00:08:57.259
The problem is, all the interesting
physics happens in the core,

00:08:57.283 --> 00:08:59.788
and the core is hidden behind
thousands of kilometers

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:01.887
of iron and carbon and silicon.

00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:04.216
We'll never see through it,
it's opaque to light.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.156
Gravitational waves go through iron
as if it were glass --

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.635
totally transparent.

00:09:10.512 --> 00:09:12.909
The Big Bang: I would love
to be able to explore

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:15.772
the first few moments of the Universe,

00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.444
but we'll never see them,

00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:21.774
because the Big Bang itself
is obscured by its own afterglow.

00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:24.322
With gravitational waves,

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:27.830
we should be able to see
all the way back to the beginning.

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:30.219
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:30.243 --> 00:09:32.681
I'm positive that there
are things out there

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.891
that we've never seen

00:09:34.915 --> 00:09:36.668
that we may never be able to see

00:09:36.692 --> 00:09:38.533
and that we haven't even imagined --

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.358
things that we'll only
discover by listening.

00:09:43.255 --> 00:09:45.915
And in fact, even
in that very first event,

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.985
LIGO found things that we didn't expect.

00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:53.055
Here's my colleague and one of the key
members of the LIGO collaboration,

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:56.717
Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,
addressing exactly that:

00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:59.951
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars
which produce the black holes

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.237
that we observed here

00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.039
are the dinosaurs of the Universe.

00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:06.738
They're these massive things
that are old, from prehistoric times,

00:10:06.762 --> 00:10:09.408
and the black holes are kind of like
the dinosaur bones

00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:11.050
with which we do this archeology.

00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:13.622
So it lets us really get
a whole nother angle

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.527
on what's out there in the Universe

00:10:15.551 --> 00:10:18.314
and how the stars came to be,
and in the end, of course,

00:10:18.338 --> 00:10:21.037
how we came to be out of this whole mess.

00:10:22.304 --> 00:10:23.956
AA: Our challenge now

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.074
is to be as audacious as possible.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.742
Thanks to LIGO, we know how
to build exquisite detectors

00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:32.335
that can listen to the Universe,

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:35.430
to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.078
Our job is to dream up and build
new observatories --

00:10:39.102 --> 00:10:41.133
a whole new generation of observatories --

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:43.156
on the ground, in space.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:48.385
I mean, what could be more glorious
than listening to the Big Bang itself?

00:10:48.973 --> 00:10:50.711
Our job now is to dream big.

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:52.783
Dream with us.

00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:53.966
Thank you.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.513
