00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.773
I'm thrilled to be here tonight

00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:17.152
to share with you something
we've been working on

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.242
for over two years,

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:21.796
and it's in the area
of additive manufacturing,

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:24.513
also known as 3D printing.

00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:26.231
You see this object here.

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:30.039
It looks fairly simple,
but it's quite complex at the same time.

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.800
It's a set of concentric
geodesic structures

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.795
with linkages between each one.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:42.797
In its context, it is not manufacturable
by traditional manufacturing techniques.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.290
It has a symmetry such
that you can't injection mold it.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.879
You can't even manufacture it
through milling.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.117
This is a job for a 3D printer,

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:58.598
but most 3D printers would take between
three and 10 hours to fabricate it,

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:02.824
and we're going to take the risk tonight
to try to fabricate it onstage

00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:05.401
during this 10-minute talk.

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:07.440
Wish us luck.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.624
Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:15.399
It's actually 2D printing
over and over again,

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:19.761
and it in fact uses the technologies
associated with 2D printing.

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:25.360
Think about inkjet printing where you
lay down ink on a page to make letters,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.346
and then do that over and over again
to build up a three-dimensional object.

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:32.417
In microelectronics, they use something

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:34.737
called lithography to do
the same sort of thing,

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:36.945
to make the transistors
and integrated circuits

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:38.997
and build up a structure several times.

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:41.399
These are all 2D printing technologies.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.987
Now, I'm a chemist,
a material scientist too,

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:48.711
and my co-inventors
are also material scientists,

00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.010
one a chemist, one a physicist,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.936
and we began to be
interested in 3D printing.

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:59.531
And very often, as you know,
new ideas are often simple connections

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:03.274
between people with different experiences
in different communities,

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:04.751
and that's our story.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.122
Now, we were inspired

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:12.893
by the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:17.836
and we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer
operate in this fashion,

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:22.362
where you have an object
arise out of a puddle

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:25.520
in essentially real time

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.749
with essentially no waste

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.071
to make a great object?

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:31.488
Okay, just like the movies.

00:02:31.488 --> 00:02:34.877
And could we be inspired by Hollywood

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.384
and come up with ways
to actually try to get this to work?

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:40.450
And that was our challenge.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.817
And our approach would be,
if we could do this,

00:02:43.817 --> 00:02:47.671
then we could fundamentally address
the three issues holding back 3D printing

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:50.086
from being a manufacturing process.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.617
One, 3D printing takes forever.

00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:57.841
There are mushrooms that grow faster
than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.417
The layer by layer process

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:04.319
leads to defects
in mechanical properties,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.266
and if we could grow continuously,
we could eliminate those defects.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:13.398
And in fact, if we could grow really fast,
we could also start using materials

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:18.042
that are self-curing,
and we could have amazing properties.

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:22.151
So if we could pull this off,
imitate Hollywood,

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.912
we could in fact address 3D manufacturing.

00:03:26.702 --> 00:03:29.953
Our approach is to use
some standard knowledge

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.553
in polymer chemistry

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:39.152
to harness light and oxygen
to grow parts continuously.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.099
Light and oxygen work in different ways.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.141
Light can take a resin
and convert it to a solid,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.295
can convert a liquid to a solid.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:50.829
Oxygen inhibits that process.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.080
So light and oxygen
are polar opposites from one another

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.588
from a chemical point of view,

00:03:56.588 --> 00:04:00.001
and if we can control spatially
the light and oxygen,

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.948
we could control this process.

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:05.739
And we refer to this as CLIP.
[Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.615
It has three functional components.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:12.326
One, it has a reservoir
that holds the puddle,

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.205
just like the T-1000.

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.621
At the bottom of the reservoir
is a special window.

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:18.112
I'll come back to that.

00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:21.892
In addition, it has a stage
that will lower into the puddle

00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:24.481
and pull the object out of the liquid.

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:28.285
The third component
is a digital light projection system

00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:30.305
underneath the reservoir,

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:33.578
illuminating with light
in the ultraviolet region.

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:37.271
Now, the key is that this window
in the bottom of this reservoir,

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.150
it's a composite,
it's a very special window.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.796
It's not only transparent to light
but it's permeable to oxygen.

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:46.455
It's got characteristics
like a contact lens.

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.716
So we can see how the process works.

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:53.130
You can start to see that
as you lower a stage in there,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.309
in a traditional process,
with an oxygen-impermeable window,

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.148
you make a two-dimensional pattern

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:03.370
and you end up gluing that onto the window
with a traditional window,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.922
and so in order to introduce
the next layer, you have to separate it,

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.451
introduce new resin, reposition it,

00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.910
and do this process over and over again.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.234
But with our very special window,

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:18.563
what we're able to do is,
with oxygen coming through the bottom

00:05:18.563 --> 00:05:19.816
as light hits it,

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:23.926
that oxygen inhibits the reaction,

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:26.550
and we form a dead zone.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.869
This dead zone is on the order
of tens of microns thick,

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.096
so that's two or three diameters
of a red blood cell,

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.627
right at the window interface
that remains a liquid,

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:38.577
and we pull this object up,

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:40.969
and as we talked about in a Science paper,

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.682
as we change the oxygen content,
we can change the dead zone thickness.

00:05:45.682 --> 00:05:49.374
And so we have a number of key variables
that we control: oxygen content,

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:52.439
the light, the light intensity,
the dose to cure,

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.401
the viscosity, the geometry,

00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:57.817
and we use very sophisticated software
to control this process.

00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:01.460
The result is pretty staggering.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.196
It's 25 to 100 times faster
than traditional 3D printers,

00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:08.170
which is game-changing.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.506
In addition, as our ability
to deliver liquid to that interface,

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:16.246
we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,

00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:19.803
and that in fact opens up the opportunity
for generating a lot of heat,

00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:23.866
and as a chemical engineer,
I get very excited at heat transfer

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:28.045
and the idea that we might one day
have water-cooled 3D printers,

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:30.437
because they're going so fast.

00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:34.500
In addition, because we're growing things,
we eliminate the layers,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.474
and the parts are monolithic.

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:38.564
You don't see the surface structure.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.057
You have molecularly smooth surfaces.

00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:45.297
And the mechanical properties
of most parts made in a 3D printer

00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:49.593
are notorious for having properties
that depend on the orientation

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:53.354
with which how you printed it,
because of the layer-like structure.

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:55.699
But when you grow objects like this,

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.368
the properties are invariant
with the print direction.

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.317
These look like injection-molded parts,

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:05.729
which is very different
than traditional 3D manufacturing.

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.259
In addition, we're able to throw

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.835
the entire polymer
chemistry textbook at this,

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:16.826
and we're able to design chemistries
that can give rise to the properties

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:19.868
you really want in a 3D-printed object.

00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:21.205
(Applause)

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:24.439
There it is. That's great.

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.627
You always take the risk that something
like this won't work onstage, right?

00:07:30.177 --> 00:07:33.056
But we can have materials
with great mechanical properties.

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:35.494
For the first time, we can have elastomers

00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:37.955
that are high elasticity
or high dampening.

00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:41.368
Think about vibration control
or great sneakers, for example.

00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:43.978
We can make materials
that have incredible strength,

00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:48.404
high strength-to-weight ratio,
really strong materials,

00:07:48.404 --> 00:07:50.517
really great elastomers,

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:53.242
so throw that in the audience there.

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:55.878
So great material properties.

00:07:55.878 --> 00:07:59.293
And so the opportunity now,
if you actually make a part

00:07:59.293 --> 00:08:02.973
that has the properties
to be a final part,

00:08:02.973 --> 00:08:06.073
and you do it in game-changing speeds,

00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:08.860
you can actually transform manufacturing.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.716
Right now, in manufacturing,
what happens is,

00:08:11.716 --> 00:08:14.678
the so-called digital thread
in digital manufacturing.

00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:19.717
We go from a CAD drawing, a design,
to a prototype to manufacturing.

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:22.440
Often, the digital thread is broken
right at prototype,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.872
because you can't go
all the way to manufacturing

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:28.587
because most parts don't have
the properties to be a final part.

00:08:28.587 --> 00:08:30.978
We now can connect the digital thread

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:35.227
all the way from design
to prototyping to manufacturing,

00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:38.176
and that opportunity
really opens up all sorts of things,

00:08:38.176 --> 00:08:43.129
from better fuel-efficient cars
dealing with great lattice properties

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:45.080
with high strength-to-weight ratio,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.508
new turbine blades,
all sorts of wonderful things.

00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:54.623
Think about if you need a stent
in an emergency situation,

00:08:54.623 --> 00:08:58.593
instead of the doctor pulling off
a stent out of the shelf

00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:00.822
that was just standard sizes,

00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:04.978
having a stent that's designed
for you, for your own anatomy

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.789
with your own tributaries,

00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:10.038
printed in an emergency situation
in real time out of the properties

00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:13.477
such that the stent could go away
after 18 months: really-game changing.

00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:17.633
Or digital dentistry, and making
these kinds of structures

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:20.814
even while you're in the dentist chair.

00:09:20.814 --> 00:09:23.530
And look at the structures
that my students are making

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.504
at the University of North Carolina.

00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:28.313
These are amazing microscale structures.

00:09:28.313 --> 00:09:31.309
You know, the world is really good
at nano-fabrication.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:35.599
Moore's Law has driven things
from 10 microns and below.

00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:37.201
We're really good at that,

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.241
but it's actually very hard to make things
from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:43.261
the mesoscale.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.094
And subtractive techniques
from the silicon industry

00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:47.510
can't do that very well.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.159
They can't etch wafers that well.

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:51.109
But this process is so gentle,

00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:53.594
we can grow these objects
up from the bottom

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.590
using additive manufacturing

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.843
and make amazing things
in tens of seconds,

00:09:57.843 --> 00:09:59.932
opening up new sensor technologies,

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.417
new drug delivery techniques,

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:06.149
new lab-on-a-chip applications,
really game-changing stuff.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.983
So the opportunity of making
a part in real time

00:10:11.983 --> 00:10:14.816
that has the properties to be a final part

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:17.792
really opens up 3D manufacturing,

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:20.992
and for us, this is very exciting,
because this really is owning

00:10:20.992 --> 00:10:27.589
the intersection between hardware,
software and molecular science,

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:31.755
and I can't wait to see what designers
and engineers around the world

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.029
