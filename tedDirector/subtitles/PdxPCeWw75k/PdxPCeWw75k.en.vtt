00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:19.767
When I was little, I thought my country
was the best on the planet.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.371
And I grew up singing a song
called "Nothing To Envy."

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:25.942
And I was very proud.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.865
In school, we spent a lot of time
studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.964
but we never learned much
about the outside world,

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:38.185
except that America, South Korea,
Japan are the enemies.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.455
Although I often wondered
about the outside world,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.119
I thought I would spend
my entire life in North Korea,

00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:48.527
until everything suddenly changed.

00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:54.368
When I was seven years old,
I saw my first public execution.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:57.460
But I thought my life
in North Korea was normal.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.953
My family was not poor,

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:03.206
and myself, I had never
experienced hunger.

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:08.215
But one day, in 1995,
my mom brought home a letter

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.239
from a coworker's sister.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:13.274
It read, "When you read this,

00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:18.130
our five family members
will not exist in this world,

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.092
because we haven't eaten
for the past three weeks.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.669
We are lying on the floor together,

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:30.362
and our bodies are so weak,
we are waiting to die."

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:35.391
I was so shocked.

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:41.344
This was the first time I heard
that people in my country were suffering.

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:46.260
Soon after, when I was walking
past a train station,

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.466
I saw something terrible that to this day
I can't erase from my memory.

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:54.637
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.826
while an emaciated child in her arms

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.085
just stared helplessly
at his mother's face.

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:04.658
But nobody helped them,

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:09.623
because they were so focused on taking
care of themselves and their families.

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.876
A huge famine hit North Korea
in the mid-1990s.

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:20.026
Ultimately, more than a million
North Koreans died during the famine,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.616
and many only survived by eating
grass, bugs and tree bark.

00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:30.203
Power outages also became
more and more frequent,

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:34.642
so everything around me
was completely dark at night,

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.112
except for the sea of lights in China,

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.642
just across the river from my home.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:43.888
I always wondered
why they had lights, but we didn't.

00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:49.236
This is a satellite picture
showing North Korea at night,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.781
compared to neighbors.

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:54.615
This is the Amnok River,

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.093
which serves as a part of the border
between North Korea and China.

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:03.809
As you can see, the river can be
very narrow at certain points,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.704
allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:09.672
But many die.

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:14.464
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies
floating down the river.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:22.363
I can't reveal many details
about how I left North Korea,

00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:26.525
but I only can say that
during the ugly years of the famine,

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.123
I was sent to China to live
with distant relatives.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.243
But I only thought that I would
be separated from my family

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.835
for a short time.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.775
I could have never imagined

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.044
that it would take 14 years
to live together.

00:03:44.298 --> 00:03:48.322
In China, it was hard living
as a young girl without my family.

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:51.665
I had no idea what life
was going to be like

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.172
as a North Korean refugee.

00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:57.329
But I soon learned it's not
only extremely difficult,

00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:59.751
it's also very dangerous,

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:06.488
since North Korean refugees are considered
in China as illegal migrants.

00:04:07.422 --> 00:04:11.993
So I was living in constant fear
that my identity could be revealed,

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:15.368
and I would be repatriated
to a horrible fate,

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:17.086
back in North Korea.

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.927
One day, my worst nightmare came true,

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.674
when I was caught by the Chinese police,

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:27.765
and brought to the police station
for interrogation.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.447
Someone had accused me
of being North Korean,

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.852
so they tested my Chinese
language abilities,

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:37.422
and asked me tons of questions.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.652
I was so scared.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:42.747
I thought my heart was going to explode.

00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:48.281
If anything seemed unnatural,
I could be imprisoned and repatriated.

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:50.995
I thought my life was over.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.768
But I managed to control
all the emotions inside me,

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.537
and answer the questions.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.898
After they finished questioning me,

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:01.347
one official said to another,

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:04.537
"This was a false report.
She's not North Korean."

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:08.083
And they let me go. It was a miracle.

00:05:09.503 --> 00:05:13.686
Some North Koreans in China
seek asylum in foreign embassies.

00:05:14.473 --> 00:05:17.941
But many can be caught
by the Chinese police,

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:19.225
and repatriated.

00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:21.427
These girls were so lucky.

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.116
Even though they were caught,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.847
they were eventually released,
after heavy international pressure.

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.186
These North Koreans were not so lucky.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.208
Every year, countless North Koreans
are caught in China

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:37.803
and repatriated to North Korea,

00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:43.006
where they can be tortured, imprisoned,
or publicly executed.

00:05:44.037 --> 00:05:47.117
Even though I was
really fortunate to get out,

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.973
many other North Koreans
have not been so lucky.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.976
It's tragic that North Koreans
have to hide their identities

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.241
and struggle so hard just to survive.

00:05:58.194 --> 00:06:01.208
Even after learning a new
language and getting a job,

00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:04.851
their whole world can be turned
upside down in an instant.

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:09.019
That's why, after 10 years
of hiding my identity,

00:06:09.043 --> 00:06:12.375
I decided to risk going to South Korea.

00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:16.182
And I started a new life yet again.

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:17.794
Settling down in South Korea

00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:20.829
was a lot more challenging
than I had expected.

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:24.924
English was so important in South Korea,

00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:27.511
so I had to start learning
my third language.

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:33.257
Also, I realized there was a wide gap
between North and South.

00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:35.434
We are all Korean, but inside,

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:40.183
we have become very different,
due to 67 years of division.

00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:44.171
I even went through an identity crisis.

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:47.568
Am I South Korean or North Korean?

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:50.690
Where am I from? Who am I?

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:56.215
Suddenly, there was no country
I could proudly call my own.

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.714
Even though adjusting to life
in South Korea was not easy,

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:07.039
I made a plan -- I started studying
for the university entrance exam.

00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:11.321
Just as I was starting
to get used to my new life,

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.781
I received a shocking phone call.

00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:16.511
The North Korean authorities
intercepted some money

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.170
that I sent to my family,

00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:23.216
and, as a punishment, my family
was going to be forcibly removed

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.033
to a desolate location in the countryside.

00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:28.414
They had to get out quickly.

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:31.986
So I started planning
how to help them escape.

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:36.365
North Koreans have to travel
incredible distances

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.143
on the path to freedom.

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:41.618
It's almost impossible to cross the border

00:07:41.642 --> 00:07:44.575
between North Korea and South Korea.

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:47.942
So, ironically, I took
a flight back to China

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.988
and headed toward the North Korean border.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.781
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,

00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:59.654
I had to guide them somehow
through more than 2,000 miles

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:03.225
in China, and then into Southeast Asia.

00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:06.097
The journey by bus took one week,

00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:08.842
and we were almost caught several times.

00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:15.596
One time, our bus was stopped
and boarded by a Chinese police officer.

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:18.362
He took everyone's I.D. cards,

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:21.103
and he started asking them questions.

00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:25.905
Since my family couldn't
understand Chinese,

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:28.465
I thought my family
was going to be arrested.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.813
As the Chinese officer
approached my family,

00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:34.491
I impulsively stood up, and I told him

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:38.578
that these are deaf and dumb people
that I was chaperoning.

00:08:39.277 --> 00:08:41.368
He looked at me suspiciously,

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:44.364
but luckily, he believed me.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.157
We made it all the way
to the border of Laos.

00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:53.228
But I had to spend almost all my money

00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:55.466
to bribe the border guards in Laos.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.587
But even after we got past the border,

00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:03.538
my family was arrested and jailed
for illegal border crossing.

00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:06.217
After I paid the fine and bribe,

00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.210
my family was released in one month.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.812
But soon after, my family
was arrested and jailed again,

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:15.670
in the capital of Laos.

00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:19.949
This was one of the lowest
points in my life.

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:26.018
I did everything to get
my family to freedom,

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:28.392
and we came so close,

00:09:28.416 --> 00:09:30.689
but my family was thrown in jail,

00:09:30.713 --> 00:09:33.684
just a short distance
from the South Korean embassy.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.313
I went back and forth
between the immigration office

00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:39.215
and the police station,

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:42.152
desperately trying to get my family out.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:45.859
but I didn't have enough money
to pay a bribe or fine anymore.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:47.748
I lost all hope.

00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:51.946
At that moment, I heard
one man's voice ask me,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.083
"What's wrong?"

00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:58.055
I was so surprised that a total stranger
cared enough to ask.

00:09:58.762 --> 00:10:01.167
In my broken English,
and with a dictionary,

00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:05.121
I explained the situation,
and without hesitating,

00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:07.392
the man went to the ATM,

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:10.169
and he paid the rest
of the money for my family,

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:13.262
and two other North Koreans
to get out of jail.

00:10:14.452 --> 00:10:17.785
I thanked him with all my heart,
and I asked him,

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:19.485
"Why are you helping me?"

00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:21.946
"I'm not helping you," he said.

00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:24.739
"I'm helping the North Korean people."

00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:29.417
I realized that this
was a symbolic moment in my life.

00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:35.299
The kind stranger symbolized new hope
for me and the North Korean people,

00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:36.791
when we needed it most.

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:40.124
And he showed me
that the kindness of strangers

00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:43.128
and the support
of the international community

00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:47.011
are truly the rays of hope
we North Korean people need.

00:10:48.337 --> 00:10:50.544
Eventually, after our long journey,

00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:53.742
my family and I were reunited
in South Korea.

00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:57.250
But getting to freedom
is only half the battle.

00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:01.313
Many North Koreans
are separated from their families,

00:11:01.337 --> 00:11:03.897
and when they arrive in a new country,

00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:06.432
they start with little or no money.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.742
So we can benefit
from the international community

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:15.558
for education, English language training,
job training, and more.

00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:18.145
We can also act as a bridge

00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:21.812
between the people inside North Korea
and the outside world.

00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:27.765
Because many of us stay in contact
with family members still inside,

00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:29.933
and we send information and money

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:33.163
that is helping to change
North Korea from inside.

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:39.745
I've been so lucky, received
so much help and inspiration in my life,

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:42.990
so I want to help give
aspiring North Koreans

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:47.671
a chance to prosper
with international support.

00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:52.126
I'm confident that you will see
more and more North Koreans

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.277
succeeding all over the world,
