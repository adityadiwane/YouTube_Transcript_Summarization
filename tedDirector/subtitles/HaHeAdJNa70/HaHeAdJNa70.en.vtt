00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:18.441
Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:22.089
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.131
Roy Chapman Andrews.

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:26.975
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History,

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:31.075
Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:32.810
like here in the Gobi Desert.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.218
He was quite a figure.

00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:37.892
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.089
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.222
I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:45.791
And I'm here to tell you,

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.495
if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:50.327
it'll be trying to hold the attention

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:54.220
of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.099
Don't try that one.

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:59.641
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.943
but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:04.860
There was a young girl who stood up,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.191
and she asked the question:

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.239
"Where should we explore?"

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.370
I think there's a sense that many of us have

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.189
that the great age of exploration on Earth is over,

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.721
that for the next generation

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.139
they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.689
in order to find something significant to explore.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.189
But is that really the case?

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.185
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.910
left here on Earth?

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.093
It sort of made me think back

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:31.843
to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.

00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.177
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.

00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:37.635
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.000
of tobacco mosaic disease.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.552
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:46.489
and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.055
And he reached the point

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:51.066
where he felt that there must be something out there

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.510
that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known --

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.554
bacteria, at the time.

00:01:56.554 --> 00:01:59.942
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:01.968
He called it the virus --

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:04.243
Latin for "poison."

00:02:04.243 --> 00:02:07.020
And in uncovering viruses,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.641
Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.

00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:12.635
We now know that viruses make up the majority

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.927
of the genetic information on our planet,

00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:16.593
more than the genetic information

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.343
of all other forms of life combined.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:21.437
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:22.691
associated with this world --

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:25.093
things like the eradication of smallpox,

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:28.748
the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:32.347
which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:34.020
And Beijerinck's discovery,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.741
this was not something that occurred 500 years ago.

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.420
It was a little over 100 years ago

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840
that Beijerinck discovered viruses.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.727
So basically we had automobiles,

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:45.970
but we were unaware of the forms of life

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.976
that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:51.158
We now have these amazing tools

00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:53.468
to allow us to explore the unseen world --

00:02:53.468 --> 00:02:55.481
things like deep sequencing,

00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:59.045
which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.135
and look at individual genomes from a particular species,

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.630
but to look at entire metagenomes,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.810
the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.331
and to document all of the genetic information in these species.

00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:13.802
We can apply these techniques

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:18.312
to things from soil to skin and everything in between.

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:21.302
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.681
to identify the causes of outbreaks

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.970
that are unclear exactly what causes them.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.302
And just to give you a sense of how this works,

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:32.302
imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.

00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:33.664
And this is something we commonly do

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:36.658
to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:38.510
The first thing we would see

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.560
is a tremendous amount of genetic information.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.968
And if we started looking into that genetic information,

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:46.303
we'd see a number of usual suspects out there --

00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:48.096
of course, a lot of human genetic information,

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.968
but also bacterial and viral information,

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:54.135
mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:57.047
But we'd also see something very, very surprising.

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.122
As we started to look at this information,

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:03.468
we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:06.385
doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before --

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.556
no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:13.060
Basically we have no clue what this is.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.180
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.895
a few of us have actually begun to call this information

00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:23.297
biological dark matter.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:26.245
We know it's not anything that we've seen before;

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:29.352
it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.070
right within our own genetic information.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.447
And there's a lot of it.

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.933
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:38.552
of biological dark matter,

00:04:38.552 --> 00:04:40.302
if we looked at your gut,

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:43.998
up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.237
And even in the relatively sterile blood,

00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:49.218
around one to two percent of this information is dark matter --

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:53.966
can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:56.593
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:59.845
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:01.918
But as they become more and more accurate,

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:05.506
we've determined that this information is a form of life,

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:08.093
or at least some of it is a form of life.

00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:12.458
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.396
are really only in their infancy,

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:18.073
there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:

00:05:18.073 --> 00:05:21.552
that buried in this life, in this genetic information,

00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:26.040
are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.975
That as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:33.310
we may uncover a completely new class of life

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.722
that, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:37.918
the way that we think about the nature of biology.

00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:42.347
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:45.879
or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.773
or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.

00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:50.458
I'm pleased to announce that,

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:55.400
along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.039
we're currently starting an initiative

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.012
to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:03.156
A little over a hundred years ago,

00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:05.860
people were unaware of viruses,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.099
the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.681
A hundred years from now, people may marvel

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.135
that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:19.439
that literally was right under our noses.

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.762
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:25.843
and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:29.399
but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.404
Beijerinck and his kind

00:06:31.404 --> 00:06:35.091
provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers --

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.423
people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.

00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:42.218
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:46.447
Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:51.510
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.629
There are unknowns all around us

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.010
and they're just waiting to be discovered.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.679
Thank you.

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:02.627
(Applause)
