00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:14.973
Do you remember
these glow-in-the-dark little stars

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:17.887
which you had on the ceiling
when you were a boy or a girl?

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.121
Yes?

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:20.341
It is light.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:21.549
It is pure light.

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:23.475
I think I stared at them way too long

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.272
when I was a five-year-old, you know?

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:26.520
It's so beautiful:

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:29.301
no energy bill, no maintenance.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:30.529
It is there.

00:00:30.553 --> 00:00:32.610
So two years ago, we went back to the lab,

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.932
making it more durable,
more light-emitting,

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:36.336
with the experts.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.041
And at the same time,
we got a request from this guy --

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.643
Van Gogh, the famous
Van Gogh Foundation --

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.643
who wanted to celebrate
his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:48.917
And they came to me and asked,

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:52.742
"Can you make a place
where he feels more alive again

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.972
in the Netherlands?"

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:55.550
And I liked that question a lot,

00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:56.728
so in way,

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:59.801
we sort of started to connect
these two different worlds.

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:02.144
This is how my brain works,

00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:03.318
by the way.

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:04.393
(Laughter)

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:06.628
I would love to keep on
doing this for an hour,

00:01:06.652 --> 00:01:07.803
but OK --

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:08.835
(Laughter)

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:10.637
And this is the result that we made:

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:13.383
a bicycle path which charges
at daytime via the sun

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.529
and glows at night, up to eight hours.

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:16.781
(Applause)

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.131
Thank you.

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:22.522
... hinting towards a future
which should be energy friendly

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:24.242
and linking up the local grounds

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.693
as Van Gogh literally walked
and lived there in 1883.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:31.024
And you can go there every night
for free, no ticket needed.

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:34.254
People experience the beauty
of cycling through the starry night,

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:36.303
thinking about green energy and safety.

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:40.042
I want to create places
where people feel connected again.

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:43.674
And it was somehow great
to make these projects happen

00:01:43.698 --> 00:01:46.544
with the industry,
with the infrastructure companies.

00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:48.857
So when these sheikhs of Qatar
started to call:

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.382
"How much for 10 kilometers?"

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:51.421
(Laughter)

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.157
Yeah, really, that's a weird call
you're going to get.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.341
But it's fascinating

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.773
that this is not just a sort
of one-off, nice-to-have special.

00:01:58.797 --> 00:02:02.220
I think this kind of creative thinking,
these kinds of connections --

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:03.428
it's the new economy.

00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:06.199
The World Economic Forum,
the think tank in Geneva,

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:08.622
did an interview
with a lot of smart people

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:09.802
all around the world,

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:14.648
asking, "What are the top 10 skills
you and I need to become successful?"

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:16.992
And what is interesting,
what you see here:

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:19.555
it's not about money

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.480
or being really good in C++,

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:25.521
although these are great skills
to have, I have to admit.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.901
But look at number three, creativity;

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:30.137
number two, critical thinking;

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:33.261
number one, complex problem-solving --

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:37.806
all the things a robot or a computer
is really bad at.

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:42.135
And this makes me very optimistic,
very hopeful for the new world,

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.035
that as we will live
in this hyper-technological world,

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.501
our human skills --

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:47.869
our desire for empathy,

00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:50.159
our desire for curiosity,

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:51.898
our desire for beauty --

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.656
will be more appreciated again,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.496
and we will live in a world
where creativity is our true capital.

00:02:58.604 --> 00:03:01.063
And a creative process like that --

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:02.786
I don't know how it works for you,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.501
but in my brain, it always starts
with a question:

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:06.679
Why?

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.227
Why does a jellyfish emit light?

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:11.606
Or a firefly?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.876
Or why do be accept pollution?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.149
This is from my room
in Beijing three years ago.

00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:18.317
Left image is a good day -- Saturday.

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.562
I can see the cars
and the people, the birds;

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:23.178
life is OK in a dense urban city.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.034
And on the right image --

00:03:25.058 --> 00:03:26.858
holy moly.

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:28.895
Pollution -- complete layers.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.627
I couldn't even see
the other side of the city.

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:33.487
And this image made me really sad.

00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:36.560
This is not the bright future
we envision here at TED --

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:37.757
this is the horror.

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.532
We live five to six years shorter;

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:42.245
children have lung cancer
when they're six years old.

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:45.134
And so in a weird, beautiful way,

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:49.312
I, at that moment, became inspired
by Beijing smog.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.152
And the governments all around the world
are fighting their war on smog,

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:55.814
but I wanted to make something
within the now.

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:59.636
So we decided to build
the largest smog vacuum cleaner

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.071
in the world.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:03.044
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it

00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:04.492
and then releases it.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:06.206
And we built the first one.

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.322
So it sucks up 30,000
cubic meters per hour,

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:13.133
cleans it on the nano level --
the PM2.5, PM10 particles --

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:15.132
using very little electricity,

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:17.623
and then releases the clean air,

00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:23.100
so we have parks, playgrounds,
which are 55 to 75 percent more clean

00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:24.691
than the rest of the city.

00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:26.384
(Applause)

00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:27.836
Yes!

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.377
(Applause)

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.298
And every month or so,

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:36.213
it opens like a spaceship --

00:04:36.237 --> 00:04:38.896
like a Marilyn Monroe with the --
well, you know what.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.110
Anyway.

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:41.210
(Laughter)

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.684
So this ...

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.655
this is the stuff we are capturing.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.877
This is Beijing smog.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.198
This is in our lungs right now.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.644
If you live next to a highway,
it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.

00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:53.818
Are we insane?

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:55.425
When did we say yes to that?

00:04:55.848 --> 00:04:59.091
And we had buckets
of this disgusting material

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:00.659
in our studio,

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:03.492
and on a Monday morning,
we were discussing, we were like,

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:06.366
"Shit, what should we do with it?
Should we throw it away?"

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.545
Like, "Help!"

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.730
And then we realized:
no, no, no, no, no --

00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:10.946
waste should not exist.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.398
Waste for the one should be
food for the other.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.322
So, here, maybe show it around.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.253
Do not put this in your coffee.

00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:19.288
(Laughter)

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:22.323
And we realized that 42 percent
is made out of carbon,

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:24.515
and carbon, of course,
under high pressure,

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.810
you get ...

00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:28.095
diamonds.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:32.250
So, inspired by that,
we compress it for 30 minutes --

00:05:32.274 --> 00:05:33.361
(Cracking sound)

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:35.465
and make smog-free rings.

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:36.512
(Laughter)

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.512
And so by sharing -- yeah, really!

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:40.174
And so by sharing a ring,

00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:42.804
you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air

00:05:42.828 --> 00:05:44.493
to the city the tower is in.

00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:45.529
(Applause)

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.783
I have one here --

00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:47.987
(Applause)

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.878
A little floating cube.

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:53.133
I will give one to you.

00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:55.387
I'm not going to propose, don't worry.

00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:56.699
(Laughter)

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.888
Are we good?

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.154
You can show it around.

00:05:59.178 --> 00:06:02.588
And we put this online --
Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.401
And people started to preorder it,

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:07.255
but more importantly,
they started to prepay it.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.648
So the finance we made with the jewelry
helped us to realize,

00:06:10.672 --> 00:06:12.297
to build the first tower.

00:06:12.693 --> 00:06:13.843
And that's powerful.

00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:16.504
So the waste the activator,
it was the enabler.

00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:18.538
Also, the feedback from the community --

00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:20.378
this is a wedding couple from India,

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:22.863
where he proposed to her
with the smog-free ring

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:24.160
as a sign of true beauty,

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:26.053
as a sign of hope.

00:06:26.077 --> 00:06:27.915
And she said yes.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.654
(Laughter)

00:06:29.678 --> 00:06:33.161
I love this image so much
for a lot of different reasons.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:34.412
(Laughter)

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:37.131
And right now, the project
is touring through China,

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:40.027
actually with the support
of China's central government.

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:43.144
So the first goal is to create
local clean-air parks,

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:45.168
and that works already quite well --

00:06:45.192 --> 00:06:47.452
55, 75 percent more clean.

00:06:47.476 --> 00:06:48.825
And at the same time,

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.246
we team up with the NGOs,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.434
with the governors,

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:52.658
with the students,

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:53.833
with the tech people,

00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:57.212
to say, "Hey, what do we need to do
to make a whole city smog-free?"

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:59.019
It's about the dream of clean air.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:01.289
We do workshops. New ideas pop up.

00:07:01.313 --> 00:07:04.107
These are smog-free bicycles
which -- I'm Dutch, yes? --

00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:06.570
I have this "bicycle DNA"
inside of me somewhere.

00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.244
And so it sucks up polluted air,

00:07:08.268 --> 00:07:09.827
it cleans it and releases it,

00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.344
in the fight against the car,

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:13.249
in the celebration of the bicycle.

00:07:13.273 --> 00:07:17.434
And so right now, we're working
on a sort of "package deal," so to speak,

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.712
where we say, "Smog-free towers,
smog-free rings."

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:23.232
We go to the mayors
or the governors of this world,

00:07:23.256 --> 00:07:27.359
and say, "We can guarantee
a short-term reduction of pollution

00:07:27.383 --> 00:07:29.466
between 20 and 40 percent.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.387
Please sign here right now."

00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:32.562
Yes?

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.313
(Applause)

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:35.487
Thank you.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.341
(Applause)

00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:42.292
So it's all about connecting
new technology with creative thinking.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.258
And if you start thinking about that,

00:07:44.282 --> 00:07:46.443
there is so much you can imagine,

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:47.990
so much more you can do.

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:51.325
We worked on dance floors
which produce electricity

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.608
when you dance on them.

00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:55.110
We did the design for that -- 2008.

00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:57.129
So it moves eight or nine millimeters,

00:07:57.153 --> 00:07:58.831
produces 25 watts.

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:02.852
The electricity that we generate
is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:05.540
So some of the sustainability
is about doing more,

00:08:05.564 --> 00:08:07.227
not about doing less.

00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:08.737
But also on a larger scale,

00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:12.210
the Netherlands, where I'm
from, we live below sea level.

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:14.512
So because of these beauties --

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:19.976
the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers,
built by hand in 1932 --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.767
we live with the water,

00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:23.321
we fight with the water,

00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:25.491
we try to find harmony,

00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.416
but sometimes we forget.

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.926
And therefore, we made "Waterlicht,"

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.170
a combination of LEDs and lenses,

00:08:32.194 --> 00:08:34.808
which show how high
the water level would be --

00:08:34.832 --> 00:08:36.113
global change --

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.204
if we stop.

00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:40.929
If, today, we all go home and we say,

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.374
"Oh, whatever, somebody else
will do it for us,"

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.418
or we'll wait for government or whomever.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.308
You know, we're not going to do that.

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:48.491
It goes wrong.

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:51.231
And we placed this in public spaces
all around the world.

00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:52.846
Thousands of people showed up.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.118
(Applause)

00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:55.292
Thank you.

00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:59.498
You're too nice, you're too nice.
That's not good for a designer.

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:01.522
So thousands of people showed up,

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:03.316
and some, actually, were scared.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.681
And they left; they experienced
the floods in 1953.

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:08.097
And others were mesmerized.

00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:09.940
Can we make floating cities?

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:13.451
Can we generate electricity
from the change in tides?

00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:16.815
So I think it's so important
to make experiences --

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:18.373
collective experiences --

00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:22.051
where people feel connected
with a vision, with a future

00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:23.845
and trigger what is possible.

00:09:24.642 --> 00:09:26.012
At the same time,

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:30.530
you know, these kinds of things --
they're not easy, yes?

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:31.808
It's a struggle.

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:33.498
And what I experienced in my life

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:35.921
is that a lot of people say
they want innovation,

00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:38.543
and they want the next
and the new, the future.

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:41.604
But the moment you present a new idea,

00:09:41.628 --> 00:09:46.014
there's this weird tendency
to reply to every new idea

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.392
starting with two words.

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.470
Which are?

00:09:50.494 --> 00:09:51.840
(Audience guesses)

00:09:51.864 --> 00:09:54.046
No, not "How much?" It's more annoying.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.078
(Laughter)

00:09:55.102 --> 00:09:56.255
What is it, guys?

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.820
Or you're really blessed people?
That's really good.

00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:00.040
"Yes, but." Very good.

00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:03.756
"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too
cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.263
it's too beautiful, it's too ugly,
it cannot be done, it already exists."

00:10:07.287 --> 00:10:09.374
I heard everything about the same project

00:10:09.398 --> 00:10:10.558
in the same week.

00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:12.511
And I got really, really annoyed.

00:10:12.535 --> 00:10:16.773
I got a bit of gray hair, started to dress
in black like a true architect.

00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:19.245
(Laughter)

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:22.727
And one morning I woke up
and I said, "Daan, stop.

00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:24.102
This is dragging you down.

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.881
You have to do something with this.

00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:28.600
You have to use it
as an ingredient, as a component."

00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:30.589
And so we decided to build,

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:34.596
to realize the famous "Yes, but" chair.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.257
(Laughter)

00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.635
And this is an existing chair
by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:44.443
But we gave it a little "update,"

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:46.798
a little "hack," so to speak.

00:10:46.822 --> 00:10:50.116
We placed a little voice-recognition
element right here.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.717
So the moment you sit on that chair,

00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:57.027
and you say those two horrible,

00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:01.501
creative-destructive,
annoying little words --

00:11:01.525 --> 00:11:02.616
(Laughter)

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.295
you get a short --

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:05.942
(Laughter)

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.539
but pretty intense

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:10.378
little shock on the back side
of your bottom.

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:11.559
(Laughter)

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:12.972
(Applause)

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.167
And --

00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:15.219
(Applause)

00:11:15.243 --> 00:11:17.041
and that works; yeah, that works.

00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:19.840
Some clients have left us,
they got really mad.

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:21.845
Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.

00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:24.256
And, of course, we also
apply it to ourselves.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.426
But ladies and gentlemen,
let's not be afraid.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.221
Let's be curious, yes?

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:31.763
And, you know, walking
through TED in these days

00:11:31.787 --> 00:11:33.486
and hearing the other speakers

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.930
and feeling the energy of the crowd,

00:11:35.954 --> 00:11:40.253
I was remembering this quote
of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,

00:11:40.277 --> 00:11:42.292
who once famously said,

00:11:42.316 --> 00:11:44.195
"On spacecraft earth,

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:45.735
there are no passengers.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.307
We are all crew."

00:11:48.846 --> 00:11:51.064
And I think this so beautiful.

00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:52.540
This is so beautiful!

00:11:52.564 --> 00:11:54.810
We're not just consumers; we're makers:

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.040
we make decisions,

00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:57.235
we make new inventions,

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.489
we make new dreams.

00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:00.057
And I think

00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:04.146
if we start implementing
that kind of thinking even more

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.712
within today,

00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:09.019
there's still a whole new world
to be explored.

00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:11.799
All right, thank you.

00:12:11.823 --> 00:12:13.951
(Applause)

00:12:13.975 --> 00:12:15.125
Thank you.

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:17.149
(Applause)
