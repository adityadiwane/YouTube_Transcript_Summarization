00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Any guesses? 1816.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And what I can say is, in 2016,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
There's a whole lot better technology coming,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and that's part of the change in medicine.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
What has changed our society

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
has been wireless devices.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So, let me give you some examples of this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to kind of make this much more concrete.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
on your smartphone,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
watching your rhythm -- that's incredible,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and it's with us today.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
But that's just the beginning.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
You check your email while you're sitting here.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.260
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.260
your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
This is already available today.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
This is AirStrip Technologies.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
by taking the aggregate of these signals

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
If you're an expectant parent,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
what about the ability to monitor, continuously,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and not having to worry so much that things are

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
fine as the pregnancy,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and moving over into the time of delivery?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And then as we go further,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
today we have continuous glucose sensors.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Right now, they are under the skin,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
between 75 and less than 200,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
you'll see how that can impact diabetes.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And what about sleep?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
What if, on your phone,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
which will be available in the next few weeks,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
you had every minute of your sleep displayed?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
dream state, is in light green;

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and light is gray, light sleep;

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
is that dark green.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
How about counting every calorie?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
measurements of caloric intake

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
But what I want to get to, the next frontier,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
very quickly, and why the stethoscope

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
is on its way out,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and the breath sounds, because now,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
the key measurements of vital signs,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that one could look at in your smartphone.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
This is now a little tiny patch.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
You can put it on for two weeks

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and send it in the mail.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Now, how does this work? Well,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And this sends a signal

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and it creates a body area network to a gateway.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
as today many of these things are dedicated gateways,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
because they are not so well integrated.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
That signal goes to the web, the cloud,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
to a caregiver, to a physician,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
back to the patient, etc.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So, that's basically very simplistic technology

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
of how this works.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Now, I have this device on.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
as you saw already,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
but it also goes well beyond that.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
This is me now. And you can see the ECG.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
to the right of that is a bioconductant.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
That's the fluid status,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
fluid status, that's really important

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And below that's temperature,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and respiration, and oxygen,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and then the position activity.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So, this is really striking, because this device

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
measures seven things

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that are very much vital signs

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And why is this important? Well,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
this is the most expensive bed.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
is the number one reason

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.260
The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So, can we improve that? Well the idea is

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
we take this device that I'm wearing,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
randomly assigned, versus 600 patients

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
who don't have active monitoring,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
but that's a type of wireless device trial

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
that could change medicine in the years ahead.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
That's where this is all starting.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Let me just give you specifics about why this is

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
a big movement if you're not aware of it:

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
1.2 million Americans

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And this Wired Magazine cover article

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and energy expenditure.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
Here are some things, the principles

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that are guiding principles to keep in mind:

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
"A data-driven health revolution

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
promises to make us all

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And this one, which is really telling,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
this was from July, this cover article:

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
of life, from sleep to mood to pain,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
24/7/365."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
Well, I tried this device.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I didn't have one of those,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
but I got the Fitbit.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
That looks like this.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
And I want to just give you the results of that testing,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I hope so.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260
But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
However you have to put in most of this stuff.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and even then, it's not complete.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
from the exercise, and how many you took in,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.260
if you go in and enter all the foods.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
But it really wants you to enter all your activity.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And so I went to this,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and of course I was gratified that it picked up

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
but then it wants more information.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
So, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
How long did you do it for?"

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
(Laughter)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And it says, "How hard was it?"

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.260
(Laughter)

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
Furthermore it says, "Start time."

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I mean, this just doesn't work.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So, now I want to move to sleep.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
It monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So, I did this thing for seven days

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
getting ready for TEDMed.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Of course how many here

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.260
have any problems with sleeping?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
Okay, well this was a week of

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
my life in sleeping,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
is adjusted to age,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and you want to get as high as you possibly can.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
So this is the moment-by-moment,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
or minute-by-minute sleep.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And the wake time is in orange.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And this can be a problem, as I learned.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Because it not only helps you with quantifying

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
your sleep,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
but also tells others you're awake.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So, when my wife came in and she

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
could tell you're awake.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And I'm trying to play possum.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
This thing is very, very impressive.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
OK. So, that's the first night.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And this one is now 67,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and that's not a good score.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
This was really fascinating because

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
this gave that quantitation

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
about all the different phases of sleep.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
It's like a managed competition of sleep.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And really interesting stuff.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Look at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.260
but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
And the key thing was, what I didn't know,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
was that I was a really good dreamer.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.260
OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
two or more chronic disease,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
140 million Americans

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
have one or more chronic disease,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
expenditures are related to chronic disease.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And here is the latest map. It was published

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and it isn't looking good.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
That is, for men, 29 percent

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and women, although it's less, it's terribly high.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
But of course we have a way to measure that now

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
on a continuous basis,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
with a sensor that detects blood glucose,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and it's important because we could detect

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and also hypoglycemia.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
But by continuous monitoring,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
it captures all that vital information.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
The future of this though,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and that's not so far away.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So, let me just give you, very quickly,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
10 top targets for wireless medicine.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
All these things are possible --

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
some of them are very close,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
or already, as you heard,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
are available today, in some way or form.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Alzheimer's disease:

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
there's five million people affected, and you can check

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
vital signs, activity, balance.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Asthma: large number, we could detect things like

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
I'll show you an example of that real quickly.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.260
to come up with much better management and prevention.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
And sleep disorders.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and cell phones today is extraordinary.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
about the opportunities in health across the developing world:

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
more quickly, than any previous technology."

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
And that's before we got going on the m-health world.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Aging: The problem is enormous,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
300,000 broken hips per year;

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
but the solutions are extraordinary,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and they include so many different things.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
One of the ones I just wanted to mention:

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
The iShoe is another example of a sensor that

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
improves proprioception among the elderly

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.260
to prevent falling.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.260
across the ages from premies or unborn children

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
the full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
across the globe.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.260
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.260
and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
to get behind this wireless health institute.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
San Diego is an extraordinary place for this.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
There's over 650 wireless companies,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
100 of which or more are working in wireless health.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
The wireless institute,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
the West Wireless Health Institute,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
who are here this evening:

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.260
(Applause)

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
and this is really a nonprofit education center

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
which is just about to open. It looks like this,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
this whole building dedicated.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
it was announced on Monday --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
then to move up with development,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
the most challenging thing of all,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
The other big thing, besides having this fantastic

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
institute to catalyze this process

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
is guidance,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.260
If we understand biology from genomics and omics

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
than in the history of man.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
And when you put that together with, for example,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
now an app for the iPhone with your genotype

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
to guide drug therapy ...

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.260
but, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
from all the common variants,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and that's going to get filled in more

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
with low-frequency variants in the future.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
from the various genes.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
And finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Each of these has a sensor.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.260
We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
for breast cancer with an ultrasound device

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
given to the patient.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
So, I hope I've convinced you of this,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.260
of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
across all these different diseases and more.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.260
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and it's hyper-innovative,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Thanks for your attention.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
(Applause)
