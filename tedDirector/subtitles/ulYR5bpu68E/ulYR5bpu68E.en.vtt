00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.097
If I asked you to picture the air,

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:18.271
what do you imagine?

00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:24.218
Most people think about either empty space

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:26.300
or clear blue sky

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:28.883
or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.350
And then I remember my high school
chemistry teacher with really long socks

00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:34.561
at the blackboard,

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:37.989
drawing diagrams of bubbles
connected to other bubbles,

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:42.633
and describing how they vibrate
and collide in a kind of frantic soup.

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:47.687
But really, we tend not to think
about the air that much at all.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:50.183
We notice it mostly

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:54.305
when there's some kind of unpleasant
sensory intrusion upon it,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.897
like a terrible smell
or something visible like smoke or mist.

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.140
But it's always there.

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:05.507
It's touching all of us right now.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.188
It's even inside us.

00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:13.764
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:17.565
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.383
So what is the air?

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:25.663
It's the combination of the invisible
gases that envelop the Earth,

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:28.213
attracted by the Earth's
gravitational pull.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.516
And even though I'm a visual artist,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.826
I'm interested in
the invisibility of the air.

00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:39.022
I'm interested in how we imagine it,

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:41.094
how we experience it

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:44.932
and how we all have an innate
understanding of its materiality

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:46.296
through breathing.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.010
All life on Earth changes the air
through gas exchange,

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.795
and we're all doing it right now.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.467
Actually, why don't we all
right now together take

00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.252
one big, collective, deep breath in.

00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:04.655
Ready? In. (Inhales)

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.627
And out. (Exhales)

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:13.272
That air that you just exhaled,

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:16.980
you enriched a hundred times
in carbon dioxide.

00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:24.315
So roughly five liters of air per breath,
17 breaths per minute

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:29.916
of the 525,600 minutes per year,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.400
comes to approximately
45 million liters of air,

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:39.418
enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:40.748
just for you.

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:45.904
Now, that's equivalent to about 18
Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:50.230
For me, air is plural.

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:53.327
It's simultaneously
as small as our breathing

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.271
and as big as the planet.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.844
And it's kind of hard to picture.

00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:03.329
Maybe it's impossible,
and maybe it doesn't matter.

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:06.413
Through my visual arts practice,

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:10.130
I try to make air, not so much picture it,

00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:14.275
but to make it visceral
and tactile and haptic.

00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:19.804
I try to expand this notion
of the aesthetic, how things look,

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:23.441
so that it can include things
like how it feels on your skin

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.163
and in your lungs,

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:27.871
and how your voice sounds
as it passes through it.

00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:34.335
I explore the weight, density and smell,
but most importantly,

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.204
I think a lot about the stories we attach
to different kinds of air.

00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.764
This is a work I made in 2014.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:49.791
It's called "Different Kinds
of Air: A Plant's Diary,"

00:03:49.815 --> 00:03:53.723
where I was recreating the air
from different eras in Earth's evolution,

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:56.747
and inviting the audience
to come in and breathe them with me.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:00.385
And it's really surprising,
so drastically different.

00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:03.751
Now, I'm not a scientist,

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:06.751
but atmospheric scientists
will look for traces

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:09.533
in the air chemistry in geology,

00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:11.874
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:15.247
and they'll extrapolate
that information and aggregate it,

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.420
such that they can
pretty much form a recipe

00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:20.124
for the air at different times.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.164
Then I come in as the artist
and take that recipe

00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:26.304
and recreate it using the component gases.

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:31.566
I was particularly interested
in moments of time

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.632
that are examples
of life changing the air,

00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:39.152
but also the air that can influence
how life will evolve,

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.590
like Carboniferous air.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.799
It's from about 300 to 350
million years ago.

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.334
It's an era known
as the time of the giants.

00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:53.605
So for the first time
in the history of life,

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.028
lignin evolves.

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:57.376
That's the hard stuff
that trees are made of.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.930
So trees effectively invent
their own trunks at this time,

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:03.000
and they get really big,
bigger and bigger,

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.379
and pepper the Earth,

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:07.696
releasing oxygen, releasing
oxygen, releasing oxygen,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.334
such that the oxygen levels
are about twice as high

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:12.755
as what they are today.

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.284
And this rich air supports
massive insects --

00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:22.832
huge spiders and dragonflies
with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.104
To breathe, this air is really clean
and really fresh.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.799
It doesn't so much have a flavor,

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:34.295
but it does give your body
a really subtle kind of boost of energy.

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.186
It's really good for hangovers.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.415
(Laughter)

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.113
Or there's the air of the Great Dying --

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:44.761
that's about 252.5 million years ago,

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.827
just before the dinosaurs evolve.

00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:50.583
It's a really short time period,
geologically speaking,

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:53.566
from about 20- to 200,000 years.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.884
Really quick.

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:58.687
This is the greatest extinction event
in Earth's history,

00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:01.275
even bigger than when
the dinosaurs died out.

00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:05.992
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species
at this time die out,

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:11.193
and simultaneous to that is a huge,
dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,

00:06:11.217 --> 00:06:12.810
that a lot of scientists agree

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:15.971
comes from a simultaneous
eruption of volcanoes

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.925
and a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:06:20.802 --> 00:06:24.405
Oxygen levels at this time go
to below half of what they are today,

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:25.724
so about 10 percent.

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:28.629
So this air would definitely not
support human life,

00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:30.675
but it's OK to just have a breath.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.735
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.682
It's really calming, it's quite warm

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:40.854
and it has a flavor a little bit
like soda water.

00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:43.383
It has that kind of spritz,
quite pleasant.

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:47.173
So with all this thinking
about air of the past,

00:06:47.197 --> 00:06:50.828
it's quite natural to start thinking
about the air of the future.

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:54.756
And instead of being speculative with air

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.294
and just making up what I think
might be the future air,

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:01.727
I discovered this human-synthesized air.

00:07:02.557 --> 00:07:05.538
That means that it doesn't occur
anywhere in nature,

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:08.679
but it's made by humans in a laboratory

00:07:08.703 --> 00:07:12.052
for application in different
industrial settings.

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:14.788
Why is it future air?

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:18.859
Well, this air is a really stable molecule

00:07:19.716 --> 00:07:23.340
that will literally be part of the air
once it's released,

00:07:23.364 --> 00:07:27.441
for the next 300 to 400 years,
before it's broken down.

00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:31.879
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:36.464
And this future air has
some very sensual qualities.

00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:39.021
It's very heavy.

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.503
It's about eight times heavier
than the air we're used to breathing.

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:48.282
It's so heavy, in fact,
that when you breathe it in,

00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:51.703
whatever words you speak
are kind of literally heavy as well,

00:07:51.727 --> 00:07:54.933
so they dribble down your chin
and drop to the floor

00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:56.606
and soak into the cracks.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:00.145
It's an air that operates
quite a lot like a liquid.

00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:05.212
Now, this air comes
with an ethical dimension as well.

00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:07.819
Humans made this air,

00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:12.099
but it's also the most potent
greenhouse gas

00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:13.869
that has ever been tested.

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:20.597
Its warming potential is 24,000 times
that of carbon dioxide,

00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:24.166
and it has that longevity
of 12 to 16 generations.

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:29.917
So this ethical confrontation
is really central to my work.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.279
(In a lowered voice) It has
another quite surprising quality.

00:08:47.303 --> 00:08:50.716
It changes the sound of your voice
quite dramatically.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.828
(Laughter)

00:08:56.965 --> 00:08:59.957
So when we start to think -- ooh!
It's still there a bit.

00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:01.415
(Laughter)

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:04.029
When we think about climate change,

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:10.022
we probably don't think about
giant insects and erupting volcanoes

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.792
or funny voices.

00:09:13.027 --> 00:09:15.536
The images that more readily come to mind

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.590
are things like retreating glaciers
and polar bears adrift on icebergs.

00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:24.159
We think about pie charts
and column graphs

00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:28.139
and endless politicians
talking to scientists wearing cardigans.

00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:34.094
But perhaps it's time we start
thinking about climate change

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:37.961
on the same visceral level
that we experience the air.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:44.998
Like air, climate change is simultaneously
at the scale of the molecule,

00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:47.427
the breath and the planet.

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:52.438
It's immediate, vital and intimate,

00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:56.815
as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:01.560
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:07.444
Climate change is the collective
self-portrait of humanity.

00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:10.031
It reflects our decisions as individuals,

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.279
as governments and as industries.

00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:16.648
And if there's anything
I've learned from looking at air,

00:10:16.672 --> 00:10:19.931
it's that even though
it's changing, it persists.

00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:24.195
It may not support the kind of life
that we'd recognize,

00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:26.316
but it will support something.

00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:30.433
And if we humans are such a vital
part of that change,

00:10:30.457 --> 00:10:34.196
I think it's important
that we can feel the discussion.

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:38.339
Because even though it's invisible,

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:43.797
humans are leaving
a very vibrant trace in the air.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.027
Thank you.

00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:47.977
(Applause)
