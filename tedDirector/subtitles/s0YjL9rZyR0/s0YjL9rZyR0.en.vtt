00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:14.044
Good morning.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:19.070
My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.779
But no, I wasn't born there.

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:24.311
This was where I was born:

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:28.283
Shanghai, at the height
of the Cultural Revolution.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:30.118
My grandmother tells me that she heard

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:33.131
the sound of gunfire
along with my first cries.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.886
When I was growing up, I was told a story

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.491
that explained all I ever
needed to know about humanity.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:41.930
It went like this.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:45.188
All human societies develop
in linear progression,

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.780
beginning with primitive
society, then slave society,

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:51.811
feudalism, capitalism, socialism,

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.155
and finally, guess where we end up?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.279
Communism!

00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:00.991
Sooner or later, all of humanity,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.757
regardless of culture,
language, nationality,

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.213
will arrive at this final stage

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:08.646
of political and social development.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.902
The entire world's peoples will be unified

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:13.166
in this paradise on Earth

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.934
and live happily ever after.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.221
But before we get there, we're engaged

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.662
in a struggle between good and evil,

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.803
the good of socialism
against the evil of capitalism,

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:25.750
and the good shall triumph.

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.246
That, of course, was the meta-narrative

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.026
distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.628
And the Chinese bought it.

00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:36.541
We were taught that grand
story day in and day out.

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:39.314
It became part of us,
and we believed in it.

00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:41.508
The story was a bestseller.

00:01:41.532 --> 00:01:43.818
About one third of the entire
world's population

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.471
lived under that meta-narrative.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:49.238
Then, the world changed overnight.

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:52.884
As for me, disillusioned
by the failed religion of my youth,

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:55.797
I went to America and became
a Berkeley hippie.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.996
(Laughter)

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.712
Now, as I was coming of age,
something else happened.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.908
As if one big story wasn't enough,

00:02:04.932 --> 00:02:07.420
I was told another one.

00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:10.652
This one was just as grand.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:12.815
It also claims that all human societies

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.660
develop in a linear progression
towards a singular end.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:19.185
This one went as follows:

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.541
All societies, regardless of culture,

00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:24.231
be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:26.960
must progress from traditional societies

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:29.506
in which groups are the basic units

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.007
to modern societies
in which atomized individuals

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.470
are the sovereign units,

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:38.213
and all these individuals
are, by definition, rational,

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:40.279
and they all want one thing:

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:42.779
the vote.

00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:45.439
Because they are all rational,
once given the vote,

00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:46.873
they produce good government

00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:49.072
and live happily ever after.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.991
Paradise on Earth, again.

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:55.092
Sooner or later, electoral
democracy will be

00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:59.103
the only political system
for all countries and all peoples,

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.567
with a free market to make them all rich.

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:05.117
But before we get there,
we're engaged in a struggle

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:06.810
between good and evil.

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:08.370
(Laughter)

00:03:08.394 --> 00:03:10.608
The good belongs to those
who are democracies

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:12.823
and are charged with a mission
of spreading it

00:03:12.847 --> 00:03:16.016
around the globe, sometimes by force,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.442
against the evil of those
who do not hold elections.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.332
(Video) George H.W. Bush:
A new world order...

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:24.023
(Video) George W. Bush:...
ending tyranny in our world...

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:26.476
(Video) Barack Obama:...
a single standard for all

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.816
who would hold power.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.620
Eric X. Li: Now --

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:38.301
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:42.324
This story also became a bestseller.

00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:44.191
According to Freedom House,

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:47.194
the number of democracies
went from 45 in 1970

00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:49.729
to 115 in 2010.

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:52.923
In the last 20 years,
Western elites tirelessly

00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:56.218
trotted around the globe
selling this prospectus:

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:58.833
Multiple parties fight for political power

00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:00.379
and everyone voting on them

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.400
is the only path to salvation

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:05.167
to the long-suffering developing world.

00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.279
Those who buy the prospectus
are destined for success.

00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:11.371
Those who do not are doomed to fail.

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:14.569
But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:17.088
Fool me once...

00:04:17.112 --> 00:04:21.657
(Laughter)

00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:23.959
The rest is history.

00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:25.555
In just 30 years, China went from

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:28.151
one of the poorest agricultural
countries in the world

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:30.074
to its second-largest economy.

00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:32.130
Six hundred fifty million people

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:33.745
were lifted out of poverty.

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:36.733
Eighty percent of the entire
world's poverty alleviation

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:38.958
during that period happened in China.

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:41.607
In other words, all the new
and old democracies

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:44.675
put together amounted to a mere fraction

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.944
of what a single, one-party
state did without voting.

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:53.122
See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:55.055
Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:57.647
per person per month at one point.

00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.818
Needless to say, I ate
all my grandmother's portions.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:05.553
So I asked myself, what's wrong
with this picture?

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:07.554
Here I am in my hometown,

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.340
my business growing leaps and bounds.

00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:11.639
Entrepreneurs are starting
companies every day.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:14.720
Middle class is expanding
in speed and scale

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:16.721
unprecedented in human history.

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.258
Yet, according to the grand story,

00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:22.193
none of this should be happening.

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:25.399
So I went and did the only thing I could.
I studied it.

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:27.406
Yes, China is a one-party state

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.291
run by the Chinese Communist
Party, the Party,

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:33.243
and they don't hold elections.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.802
Three assumptions are made

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:38.456
by the dominant political
theories of our time.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.339
Such a system is operationally rigid,

00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:45.025
politically closed,
and morally illegitimate.

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:48.235
Well, the assumptions are wrong.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.445
The opposites are true.

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.783
Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:55.717
are the three defining characteristics

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.088
of China's one-party system.

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.160
Now, most political
scientists will tell us

00:06:00.184 --> 00:06:03.345
that a one-party system
is inherently incapable

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.273
of self-correction.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:07.591
It won't last long
because it cannot adapt.

00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.389
Now here are the facts.

00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:12.949
In 64 years of running the largest
country in the world,

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.509
the range of the Party's policies
has been wider

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.426
than any other country in recent memory,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.397
from radical land collectivization
to the Great Leap Forward,

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:25.049
then privatization of farmland,

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:27.345
then the Cultural Revolution,

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.041
then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:33.454
then successor Jiang Zemin
took the giant political step

00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:36.602
of opening up Party membership
to private businesspeople,

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:39.665
something unimaginable during Mao's rule.

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.486
So the Party self-corrects
in rather dramatic fashions.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.116
Institutionally, new rules get enacted

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.695
to correct previous dysfunctions.

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.569
For example, term limits.

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:53.355
Political leaders used to retain
their positions for life,

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.189
and they used that to accumulate power

00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:56.758
and perpetuate their rules.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.978
Mao was the father of modern China,

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.850
yet his prolonged rule led
to disastrous mistakes.

00:07:01.874 --> 00:07:04.010
So the Party instituted term limits

00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:07.763
with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.

00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:10.012
One thing we often hear is,

00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:13.190
"Political reforms have lagged
far behind economic reforms,"

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:16.464
and "China is in dire need
of political reform."

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:19.423
But this claim is a rhetorical trap

00:07:19.447 --> 00:07:22.039
hidden behind a political bias.

00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:24.536
See, some have decided a priori

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.418
what kinds of changes they want to see,

00:07:26.442 --> 00:07:30.025
and only such changes can
be called political reform.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.985
The truth is, political
reforms have never stopped.

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.218
Compared with 30 years ago,
20 years, even 10 years ago,

00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:38.608
every aspect of Chinese society,

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:39.480
how the country is governed,

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.790
from the most local level
to the highest center,

00:07:41.814 --> 00:07:44.213
are unrecognizable today.

00:07:44.237 --> 00:07:47.399
Now such changes are simply not possible

00:07:47.423 --> 00:07:51.119
without political reforms
of the most fundamental kind.

00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:53.312
Now I would venture to suggest the Party

00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:57.419
is the world's leading
expert in political reform.

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.451
The second assumption
is that in a one-party state,

00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:03.182
power gets concentrated
in the hands of the few,

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:05.884
and bad governance and corruption follow.

00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:08.057
Indeed, corruption is a big problem,

00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.191
but let's first look
at the larger context.

00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:12.319
Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.

00:08:12.343 --> 00:08:15.338
The Party happens to be
one of the most meritocratic

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:18.134
political institutions in the world today.

00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:22.235
China's highest ruling body,
the Politburo, has 25 members.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:24.323
In the most recent one, only five of them

00:08:24.347 --> 00:08:27.945
came from a background of privilege,
so-called princelings.

00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:30.541
The other 20, including the president
and the premier,

00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:33.196
came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.637
In the larger central
committee of 300 or more,

00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.504
the percentage of those who were born

00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:39.963
into power and wealth was even smaller.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.793
The vast majority
of senior Chinese leaders

00:08:42.817 --> 00:08:45.438
worked and competed their way to the top.

00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:47.570
Compare that with the ruling elites

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.672
in both developed
and developing countries,

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.182
I think you'll find the Party
being near the top

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.816
in upward mobility.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.345
The question then is,
how could that be possible

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.564
in a system run by one party?

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:03.456
Now we come to a powerful
political institution,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.973
little-known to Westerners:

00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:07.624
the Party's Organization Department.

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:09.824
The department functions like a giant

00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:12.200
human resource engine
that would be the envy

00:09:12.224 --> 00:09:15.530
of even some of the most successful
corporations.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.799
It operates a rotating pyramid

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.166
made up of three components:

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.722
civil service, state-owned enterprises,

00:09:21.746 --> 00:09:23.966
and social organizations like a university

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.104
or a community program.

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:28.615
They form separate
yet integrated career paths

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.519
for Chinese officials.

00:09:30.543 --> 00:09:33.604
They recruit college grads
into entry-level positions

00:09:33.628 --> 00:09:36.354
in all three tracks,
and they start from the bottom,

00:09:36.378 --> 00:09:37.910
called "keyuan" [clerk].

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.293
Then they could get promoted

00:09:39.317 --> 00:09:44.409
through four increasingly elite ranks:

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:47.721
fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu
[deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].

00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:50.031
Now these are not moves
from "Karate Kid," okay?

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:53.375
It's serious business.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.712
The range of positions is wide,

00:09:55.736 --> 00:09:57.498
from running health care in a village

00:09:57.522 --> 00:09:59.559
to foreign investment in a city district

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:01.684
to manager in a company.

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.280
Once a year, the department
reviews their performance.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.615
They interview
their superiors, their peers,

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.396
their subordinates. They vet
their personal conduct.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.428
They conduct public opinion surveys.

00:10:11.452 --> 00:10:13.391
Then they promote the winners.

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:15.225
Throughout their careers, these cadres

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.059
can move
through and out of all three tracks.

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:20.937
Over time, the good ones move
beyond the four base levels

00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:23.961
to the fuju [deputy bureau chief]
and ju [bureau chief] levels.

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:26.473
There, they enter high officialdom.

00:10:26.497 --> 00:10:28.633
By that point, a typical
assignment will be

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:31.492
to manage a district
with a population in the millions

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:35.023
or a company with hundreds
of millions of dollars in revenue.

00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:38.952
Just to show you
how competitive the system is,

00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:42.670
in 2012, there were 900,000
fuke and ke levels,

00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:45.494
600,000 fuchu and chu levels,

00:10:45.518 --> 00:10:48.929
and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.

00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:50.657
After the ju levels,

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:53.258
the best few move further
up several more ranks,

00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.389
and eventually make it
to the Central Committee.

00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:59.141
The process takes two to three decades.

00:10:59.165 --> 00:11:02.250
Does patronage play a role?
Yes, of course.

00:11:02.274 --> 00:11:05.822
But merit remains the fundamental driver.

00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:08.352
In essence, the Organization
Department runs

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.825
a modernized version
of China's centuries-old

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:12.889
mentoring system.

00:11:12.913 --> 00:11:14.980
China's new president, Xi Jinping,

00:11:15.004 --> 00:11:17.559
is the son of a former leader,
which is very unusual,

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:19.779
first of his kind to make the top job.

00:11:19.803 --> 00:11:22.674
Even for him, the career took 30 years.

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:24.542
He started as a village manager,

00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:26.519
and by the time he entered the Politburo,

00:11:26.543 --> 00:11:28.660
he had managed areas
with a total population

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:30.264
of 150 million people

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:34.710
and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S.
dollars.

00:11:34.734 --> 00:11:37.030
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?

00:11:37.054 --> 00:11:40.284
This is not a put-down of anyone.
It's just a statement of fact.

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:44.118
George W. Bush, remember him?

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:46.559
This is not a put-down.

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:47.364
(Laughter)

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:50.463
Before becoming governor of Texas,

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:53.082
or Barack Obama
before running for president,

00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:55.841
could not make even a small county manager

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.769
in China's system.

00:11:57.793 --> 00:11:59.793
Winston Churchill once said that democracy

00:11:59.817 --> 00:12:02.110
is a terrible system
except for all the rest.

00:12:02.134 --> 00:12:06.391
Well, apparently he hadn't heard
of the Organization Department.

00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:08.735
Now, Westerners always assume that

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:11.753
multi-party election
with universal suffrage

00:12:11.777 --> 00:12:14.895
is the only source
of political legitimacy.

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:18.257
I was asked once, "The Party
wasn't voted in by election.

00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:20.487
Where is the source of legitimacy?"

00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:24.049
I said, "How about competency?"

00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:25.526
We all know the facts.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.467
In 1949, when the Party took power,

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.794
China was mired in civil wars,
dismembered by foreign aggression,

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:35.089
average life expectancy
at that time, 41 years old.

00:12:35.113 --> 00:12:37.999
Today, it's the second largest
economy in the world,

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.602
an industrial powerhouse,
and its people live

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.689
in increasing prosperity.

00:12:42.713 --> 00:12:45.842
Pew Research polls Chinese
public attitudes,

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.899
and here are the numbers in recent years.

00:12:47.923 --> 00:12:52.399
Satisfaction with the direction
of the country: 85 percent.

00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:55.043
Those who think they're better
off than five years ago:

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.974
70 percent.

00:12:56.998 --> 00:12:59.358
Those who expect the future to be better:

00:12:59.382 --> 00:13:02.022
a whopping 82 percent.

00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:05.551
Financial Times polls
global youth attitudes,

00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:08.966
and these numbers, brand new,
just came from last week.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.748
Ninety-three percent
of China's Generation Y

00:13:11.772 --> 00:13:14.334
are optimistic
about their country's future.

00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:20.222
Now, if this is not legitimacy,
I'm not sure what is.

00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:23.391
In contrast, most electoral
democracies around the world

00:13:23.415 --> 00:13:25.494
are suffering from dismal performance.

00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:27.809
I don't need to elaborate
for this audience

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:32.146
how dysfunctional it is,
from Washington to European capitals.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.035
With a few exceptions, the vast number

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:37.942
of developing countries that have
adopted electoral regimes

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:41.753
are still suffering
from poverty and civil strife.

00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:43.825
Governments get elected,
and then they fall

00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:46.428
below 50 percent approval in a few months

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:49.976
and stay there and get worse
until the next election.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.399
Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle

00:13:52.423 --> 00:13:54.777
of elect and regret.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:58.306
At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.926
not China's one-party
system, that is in danger

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.185
of losing legitimacy.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.035
Now, I don't want to create
the misimpression

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:08.043
that China's hunky-dory, on the way

00:14:08.067 --> 00:14:09.836
to some kind of superpowerdom.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.795
The country faces enormous challenges.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.819
The social and economic problems that come

00:14:14.843 --> 00:14:18.704
with wrenching change
like this are mind-boggling.

00:14:18.728 --> 00:14:22.251
Pollution is one. Food safety.
Population issues.

00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:26.198
On the political front, the worst
problem is corruption.

00:14:26.222 --> 00:14:29.030
Corruption is widespread
and undermines the system

00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:30.832
and its moral legitimacy.

00:14:30.856 --> 00:14:33.679
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.

00:14:33.703 --> 00:14:36.588
They say that corruption is the result
of the one-party system,

00:14:36.612 --> 00:14:38.279
and therefore, in order to cure it,

00:14:38.303 --> 00:14:40.351
you have to do away
with the entire system.

00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:43.228
But a more careful look
would tell us otherwise.

00:14:43.252 --> 00:14:46.148
Transparency International ranks China

00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:49.914
between 70 and 80 in recent
years among 170 countries,

00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:52.091
and it's been moving up.

00:14:52.115 --> 00:14:54.154
India, the largest democracy in the world,

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:56.301
94 and dropping.

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:59.183
For the hundred or so countries
that are ranked below China,

00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:01.772
more than half of them
are electoral democracies.

00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:05.067
So if election is the panacea
for corruption,

00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:08.310
how come these countries can't fix it?

00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:11.904
Now, I'm a venture capitalist.
I make bets.

00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:14.236
It wouldn't be fair
to end this talk without

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.880
putting myself on the line
and making some predictions.

00:15:16.904 --> 00:15:18.585
So here they are.

00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:21.387
In the next 10 years, China
will surpass the U.S.

00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.764
and become the largest
economy in the world.

00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:25.845
Income per capita will be near the top

00:15:25.869 --> 00:15:28.027
of all developing countries.

00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:30.349
Corruption will be curbed,
but not eliminated,

00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:32.762
and China will move up 10 to 20 notches

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:35.604
to above 60 in T.I. ranking.

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:38.676
Economic reform will accelerate,
political reform will continue,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.032
and the one-party system will hold firm.

00:15:42.056 --> 00:15:45.190
We live in the dusk of an era.

00:15:45.214 --> 00:15:48.475
Meta-narratives that make universal claims

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:50.436
failed us in the 20th century

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.220
and are failing us in the 21st.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.814
Meta-narrative is the cancer

00:15:55.838 --> 00:15:58.621
that is killing democracy from the inside.

00:15:58.645 --> 00:16:00.388
Now, I want to clarify something.

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:02.908
I'm not here to make
an indictment of democracy.

00:16:02.932 --> 00:16:05.501
On the contrary, I think
democracy contributed

00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:08.697
to the rise of the West
and the creation of the modern world.

00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:11.808
It is the universal claim
that many Western elites

00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:15.297
are making about their political
system, the hubris,

00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:18.536
that is at the heart
of the West's current ills.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.841
If they would spend
just a little less time

00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:22.981
on trying to force their way onto others,

00:16:23.005 --> 00:16:26.648
and a little bit more
on political reform at home,

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:30.038
they might give their democracy
a better chance.

00:16:30.062 --> 00:16:32.416
China's political model
will never supplant

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.736
electoral democracy,
because unlike the latter,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.693
it doesn't pretend to be universal.

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:40.525
It cannot be exported. But
that is the point precisely.

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:43.124
The significance of China's example

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:45.091
is not that it provides an alternative,

00:16:45.115 --> 00:16:49.531
but the demonstration
that alternatives exist.

00:16:49.555 --> 00:16:53.165
Let us draw to a close this
era of meta-narratives.

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:56.528
Communism and democracy may
both be laudable ideals,

00:16:56.552 --> 00:17:00.629
but the era of their dogmatic
universalism is over.

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:03.116
Let us stop telling
people and our children

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.368
there's only one way to govern ourselves

00:17:05.392 --> 00:17:07.177
and a singular future towards which

00:17:07.201 --> 00:17:09.559
all societies must evolve.

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:12.354
It is wrong. It is irresponsible.

00:17:12.378 --> 00:17:16.592
And worst of all, it is boring.

00:17:16.616 --> 00:17:20.511
Let universality make way for plurality.

00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:23.708
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.

00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:25.921
Are we brave enough to welcome it?

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:27.115
Thank you.

00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:43.134
(Applause)

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:46.770
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

00:17:46.794 --> 00:17:48.976
Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay
with me for a couple of minutes,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.690
because I want to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:17:51.714 --> 00:17:55.218
I think many here, and in general
in Western countries,

00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:58.620
would agree with your statement
about analysis

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:01.325
of democratic systems
becoming dysfunctional,

00:18:01.349 --> 00:18:04.252
but at the same time,
many would kind of find

00:18:04.276 --> 00:18:08.197
unsettling the thought
that there is an unelected

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:13.593
authority that, without any form
of oversight or consultation,

00:18:13.617 --> 00:18:16.508
decides what the national interest is.

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:19.510
What is the mechanism in the Chinese model

00:18:19.534 --> 00:18:21.729
that allows people to say, actually,

00:18:21.753 --> 00:18:24.316
the national interest
as you defined it is wrong?

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.378
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama,
the political scientist,

00:18:28.402 --> 00:18:32.222
called the Chinese system
"responsive authoritarianism."

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:35.332
It's not exactly right,
but I think it comes close.

00:18:35.356 --> 00:18:39.306
So I know the largest public
opinion survey company

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.188
in China, okay?

00:18:41.212 --> 00:18:43.868
Do you know who their biggest client is?

00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:45.714
The Chinese government.

00:18:45.738 --> 00:18:48.180
Not just from the central government,

00:18:48.204 --> 00:18:49.604
the city government,
the provincial government,

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.683
to the most local neighborhood districts.

00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:53.826
They conduct surveys all the time.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.436
Are you happy with the garbage collection?

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.548
Are you happy with the general
direction of the country?

00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:01.809
So there is, in China, there
is a different kind of mechanism

00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:05.370
to be responsive to the demands
and the thinking of the people.

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.578
My point is, I think we should get unstuck

00:19:08.602 --> 00:19:11.009
from the thinking
that there's only one political system --

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.554
election, election, election --

00:19:12.578 --> 00:19:14.282
that could make it responsive.

00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:16.266
I'm not sure, actually, elections produce

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.212
responsive government
anymore in the world.

00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:23.919
(Applause)

00:19:23.943 --> 00:19:25.079
BG: Many seem to agree.

00:19:25.103 --> 00:19:27.735
One of the features of a democratic system

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:31.004
is a space for civil
society to express itself.

00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:33.372
And you have shown figures
about the support

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:36.276
that the government
and the authorities have in China.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.581
But then you've just
mentioned other elements

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:41.735
like, you know, big challenges,
and there are, of course,

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:44.661
a lot of other data that go
in a different direction:

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:47.318
tens of thousands of unrests and protests

00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:50.177
and environmental protests, etc.

00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:53.193
So you seem to suggest the Chinese model

00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:55.304
doesn't have a space outside of the Party

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:57.605
for civil society to express itself.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:20:01.783
EXL: There's a vibrant
civil society in China,

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:03.412
whether it's environment or what-have-you.

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.660
But it's different. You
wouldn't recognize it.

00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:08.542
Because, by Western definitions,
a so-called civil society

00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:11.386
has to be separate or even in opposition

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.077
to the political system,

00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:17.842
but that concept is alien
for Chinese culture.

00:20:17.866 --> 00:20:20.315
For thousands of years,
you have civil society,

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:22.804
yet they are consistent and coherent

00:20:22.828 --> 00:20:25.651
and part of a political order, and I think

00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:29.021
it's a big cultural difference.

00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:32.672
BG: Eric, thank you for sharing
this with TED. EXL: Thank you.
