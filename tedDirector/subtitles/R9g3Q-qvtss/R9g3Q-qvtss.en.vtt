00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And I go on the podium.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
You know, this little office of the conductor.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
with a lot of space.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And in front of all that noise,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
you do a very small gesture.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Noise becomes music.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
to think that it's all about me.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
(Laughter)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
All those great people here, virtuosos,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
they make noise, they need me to do that.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Not really. If it were that,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I would just save you the talk,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and teach you the gesture.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So you could go out to the world

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Let's look at the first video.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
(Music)

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Was that nice?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So that was a sort of a success.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Now, who should we thank for the success?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
playing beautifully,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
They don't often even look at the conductor.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
actually taking part in doing the music.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that you will ever get in Vienna.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.260
(Laughter)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Laughter)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So that's a sort of a tradition.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
But Viennese audiences do not do that.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
You know, audiences like you, yeah,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
make the event.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
But what about the conductor? What can you say

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the conductor was doing, actually?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Um, he was happy.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And I often show this to senior management.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
People get annoyed.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
does not come from

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
only his own story and his joy of the music.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
The joy is about enabling other people's stories

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
to be heard at the same time.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
You have the stories of the individuals

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
in the orchestra and in the audience.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And then you have other stories, unseen.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
People who build this wonderful concert hall.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.260
People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And all those stories are being heard at the same time.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
This is the true experience of a live concert.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And not all conductors do just that.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Riccardo Muti, please.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.260
(Music)

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Yeah, that was very short, but you could see

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
it's a completely different figure. Right?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.260
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Okay? Ready?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Itay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I feel even more redundant than I already feel.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
So please, wait for the conductor.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
(Laughter)

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.260
(Laughter)

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.260
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260
But -- (Laughter)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.260
(Laughter)

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And then -- sort of -- (Laughter)

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
So not only the instruction is clear,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
(Laughter)

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So, does it work? Yes, it works --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
to a certain point.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
He says, "I'm responsible."

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Responsible in front of him.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.260
which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.260
(Laughter)

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So he says, "If I'm --

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
(Applause)

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
if I'm responsible for Mozart,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
this is going to be the only story to be told.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And you know what happened to Muti?

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Three years ago he got a letter signed by

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
all 700 employees of La Scala,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
musical employees, I mean the musicians,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.260
saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.260
(Laughter)

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
"Why? Because you don't let us develop.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
(Laughter)

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Well, can you do it with less control,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
or with a different kind of control?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
(Music)

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
It's not true. When he was a young man

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
of about 30, he wrote what he called

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
it means that you must have done something wrong.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
It says: Never look at the trombones --

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
it only encourages them.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.260
(Laughter)

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
So, the whole idea is really to let

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
it happen by itself.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Do not interfere.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
But how does it happen? Did you see

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
him turning pages in the score?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Now, either he is senile,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
So it's not about my story. It's not about your story.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
It's only the execution of the written music,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
no interpretation."

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Interpretation is the real story of the performer.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Let's see another super-conductor,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.260
(Music)

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Did you see the hands?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.260
Audience: (Claps)

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Audience: (Claps)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Because you didn't know when to play.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
doesn't know when to play.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260
(Laughter)

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
This is a German orchestra, yes?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
(Laughter)

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
"Do you understand what this guy wants?"

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And after doing that,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
lead the whole ensemble in playing together.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And when Karajan is asked about it

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
I can do to my orchestra

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.260
is to give them a clear instruction.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Because that would

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.260
prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that is needed for an orchestra."

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Now that's great. What about the eyes?

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Why are the eyes closed?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.260
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And he cues in a flute player like this.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.260
Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
(Laughter)

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
because I don't give you instruction,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and yet, you have to guess my mind.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
very firm control.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
to the first conductor we've seen:

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
(Music)

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
(Laughter) Yeah.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
When he does this, it's not,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
smash it on the floor." It's not that.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
I'm opening a space for you

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
to put in another layer

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
of interpretation."

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
That is another story.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
But how does it really work together

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
if it doesn't give them instructions?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
You're not really given any instructions,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.260
but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
That's what he does.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.260
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And that's what makes them into partners.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
You have the plan in your head.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
But here and there and that. You know what to do.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
yeah, with sound,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
as you actually take the ride.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
This is very exciting for those players.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.260
(Laughter)

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
It is very tiring. Yeah?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
But it's the best music making, like this.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
But of course it's not only about motivation

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
and giving them a lot of physical energy.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
You also have to be very professional.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And look again at this Kleiber.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Can we have the next video, quickly?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.260
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
(Music)

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And now there is a trumpet player who

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
does something not exactly the way it should be done.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Go along with the video. Look.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.260
See, second time for the same player.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.260
(Laughter)

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
"Wait for me after the concert.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
I have a short notice to give you."

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.260
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
But authority is not enough to make people your partners.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
as such a hyperactive guy.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
He's conducting Mozart.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
(Music)

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
The whole orchestra is playing.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
(Music)

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Now something else.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Music)

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.260
See? He is there 100 percent,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
but not commanding, not telling what to do.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
(Music)

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
(Music)

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
Look at the eyes.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Okay. You see that?

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
So that's a good thing.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And the second thing is

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
it's about actually being in control,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
but in a very special way.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
going from here? (Singing)

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.260
You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Kleiber not only creates a process,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
but also creates the conditions in the world

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
in which this process takes place.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
So again, the oboe player

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
is completely autonomous

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
and therefore happy and proud of his work,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
and creative and all of that.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.260
in partnership, brings about the best music.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
So Kleiber is about process.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.260
But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Since he was a great teacher,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.260
Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.260
(Music)

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.260
(Laughter)

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
Did you see Lenny's face?

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.260
You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
And you're playing a painful sound.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
But not in a way that you want to stop.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.260
It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.260
(Laughter)

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
But you can see the music on his face.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
Now it's about you, the player,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
telling the story.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
And even briefly, you become the storyteller

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
to which the community, the whole community, listens to.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.260
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.260
Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
and maybe some others,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.260
And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
My friend Peter says,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.260
"If you love something, give it away." So, please.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.260
(Music)

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:46.260
(Applause)
