00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:16.564
I'd like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.072
You're a little girl of five years old.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.618
Sitting in front of a mirror,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.141
you ask yourself,

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:27.406
"Do I exist?"

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:31.726
In this space, there is
very little context,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.314
and so you move into a different one,

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.912
one filled with people.

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:40.207
Surely, now you know you're not
a figment of your own imagination.

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:42.574
You breathe their air.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.635
You see them,

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.073
so they must see you.

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:50.808
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.129
Do I only exist when people speak to me?

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.570
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:05.329
But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:09.503
I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:14.641
feeling as if she's not seen,
and perhaps she doesn't exist.

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:19.926
You see, if young people don't have
positive images of themselves

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.118
and all that remains
are negative stereotypes,

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:24.967
this affects their self-image.

00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:29.380
But it also affects the way
that the rest of society treats them.

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:32.338
I discovered this

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:36.067
having lived in Cape Town
for about five years at the time.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:41.884
I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:45.206
I couldn't see myself represented.

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.036
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.922
the ones who've influenced me,

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:53.677
and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.644
I decided to do something about it.

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:01.518
What do you think when you see this?

00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:05.692
If you were a black girl,

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:07.451
how would it make you feel?

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:11.538
Walking down the street,

00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:14.476
what does the city you live in say to you?

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:16.882
What symbols are present?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.971
Which histories are celebrated?

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.105
And on the other hand,

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.670
which ones are omitted?

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:27.574
You see, public spaces are hardly
ever as neutral as they may seem.

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:34.292
I discovered this when I made
this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:41.227
Cape Town is teeming
with masculine architecture,

00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.310
monuments and statues,

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:45.598
such as Louis Botha in that photograph.

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:52.572
This overt presence of white colonial
and Afrikaner nationalist men

00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:58.018
not only echoes a social,
gender and racial divide,

00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:03.373
but it also continues to affect
the way that women --

00:03:03.397 --> 00:03:06.597
and the way, particularly, black women --

00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:12.032
see themselves in relation
to dominant male figures

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:13.481
in public spaces.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.188
For this reason, among others,

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:21.284
I don't believe that we need statues.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:26.212
The preservation of history
and the act of remembering

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:30.571
can be achieved in more memorable
and effective ways.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:36.103
As part of a year-long
public holiday series,

00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:40.254
I use performance art
as a form of social commentary

00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:43.476
to draw people's attention
to certain issues,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.450
as well as addressing the absence
of the black female body

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:51.712
in memorialized public spaces,

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.702
especially on public holidays.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:56.594
Women's Day was coming up.

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.802
I looked at what the day means --

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.435
the Women's March
to the union buildings in 1956,

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.919
petitioning against the pass laws.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.696
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
of how women are treated,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.851
especially in public spaces today,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.038
I decided to do something about it.

00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:20.813
Headline:

00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:26.379
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:32.431
How do I comment on such polar opposites?

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:35.698
In the guise of my great-grandmother,

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:37.425
I performed bare-breasted,

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.405
close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.727
This space is also called Freedom Square,

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:47.604
where women were a part of demonstrations
against apartheid laws.

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:55.117
I was not comfortable with women
being seen as only victims in society.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:58.981
You might wonder
how people reacted to this.

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:02.449
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)

00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:04.774
Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!

00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:15.029
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?

00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:18.504
(Applause)

00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:22.656
So I realized that through
my performances,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.764
I've been able to make regular people
reflect upon their society,

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:31.488
looking at the past
as well as the current democracy.

00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:34.469
(Video) Man (offscreen):
She's been there since three o'clock.

00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:37.227
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
About an hour still?

00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.216
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.

00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:47.515
Man 1: It's very interesting.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.045
It's very powerful.

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:51.603
I think it's cool.

00:05:54.463 --> 00:05:59.788
I think a lot of people
are quick to join a group

00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:01.684
that's a movement towards something,

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:06.935
but not many people are ready
to do something as an individual.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.566
Man 2: So it's the individual
versus the collective.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.746
Man 1: Yeah.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.027
So I think her pushing her own
individual message in performance ...

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.002
it's powerful.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:23.179
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful
that she's doing it on her own.

00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:29.427
I'd be interested to know why
she's using hair extensions as wings,

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:33.199
or whatever those things are meant to be.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.385
They are wings, yes?

00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:40.840
Woman 3: With her standing
there right now,

00:06:40.864 --> 00:06:44.824
I think it's just my interpretation

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:48.219
that we are bringing the statue down

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:50.468
and bringing up something

00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:55.097
that's supposed to represent
African pride, I think.

00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:56.641
Or something like that.

00:06:57.621 --> 00:07:01.097
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:03.828
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.

00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:05.784
Yes. Thank you.

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:09.271
Man 3: What is behind me
represents the African culture.

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.684
We can't have the colonialist law,

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:14.599
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:17.117
We have have our own statues now,

00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:22.013
our African leaders --
Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --

00:07:22.037 --> 00:07:26.270
all those who paid their lives
for our liberation.

00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:28.602
We can't continue in the 21st century,

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.663
and after 21 years of democracy,

00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:32.827
have the colonizers in our own country.

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:35.824
They belong somewhere.
Maybe in a museum; not here.

00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:38.998
I mean learning institutions,
places where young people,

00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:40.600
young minds are being shaped.

00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:45.314
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
Rhodes, all these people,

00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:48.103
because they're representing
the colonialism.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:54.541
(Applause)

00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:58.858
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,

00:07:58.882 --> 00:08:02.859
the Cecil John Rhodes statue
was scheduled to be removed

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:07.098
after a month of debates
for and against its removal

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:08.910
by various stakeholders.

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:14.340
This caused a widespread interest
in statues in South Africa.

00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:20.362
Opinions varied, but the media
focused on problematizing

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:21.967
the removal of statues.

00:08:24.912 --> 00:08:28.747
On that -- well, that year,
I had just begun my master's

00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:30.636
at the University of Cape Town.

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:35.455
During the time
of the debate of the statue,

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.578
I had been having reoccurring dreams

00:08:39.413 --> 00:08:40.745
about a bird.

00:08:41.317 --> 00:08:43.995
And so I started conjuring her

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.486
mentally, spiritually and through dress.

00:08:49.872 --> 00:08:51.565
On that day,

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:55.225
I happened to be having
a meeting with my supervisors,

00:08:55.249 --> 00:08:58.854
and they told me that the statue
was going to fall on that day.

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:02.344
I told them that I'd explain later,

00:09:02.368 --> 00:09:04.306
but we had to postpone the meeting

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.808
because I was going to perform her
as the statue came down.

00:09:09.352 --> 00:09:11.232
Her name was Chapungu.

00:09:11.256 --> 00:09:15.636
She was a soapstone bird
that was looted from Great Zimbabwe

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.408
in the late 1800s,

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:21.465
and is still currently housed
in Cecil John Rhodes's estate

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:22.639
in Cape Town.

00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:25.100
On that day,

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:29.234
I embodied her existence using my body,

00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:33.119
while standing in the blazing sun
for nearly four hours.

00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:36.910
As the time came,

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:38.477
the crane came alive.

00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:40.798
The people did, too --

00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:41.981
shouting,

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:43.242
screaming,

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.176
clenching their fists

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.082
and taking pictures of the moment
on their phones and cameras.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.278
Chapungu's wings,

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:52.701
along with the crane,

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:57.698
rose to declare the fall
of Cecil John Rhodes.

00:09:58.963 --> 00:10:03.039
(Applause)

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:08.605
Euphoria filled the air
as he became absent from his base,

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.677
while she remained still,

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.610
very present,

00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:16.279
half an hour after his removal.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.030
Twenty-three years after apartheid,

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:24.457
a new generation of radicals
has arisen in South Africa.

00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:29.354
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
in the same space and time

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.133
asks important questions

00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:33.432
related to gender,

00:10:34.056 --> 00:10:35.333
power,

00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:37.138
self-representation,

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:38.751
history making

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:40.203
and repatriation.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.220
From then on,

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:49.465
I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:52.004
texture my material reality.

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:56.612
But for me, Chapungu's story
felt incomplete.

00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:58.385
This soapstone bird,

00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:02.776
a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.899
needed me to continue her story.

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:09.917
And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,

00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:12.572
and this is how "Falling" was born.

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:20.676
[A film by Sethembile Msezane]

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.945
(Video) (A capella singing)

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:55.000
[FALLING]

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:01.712
(Applause)

00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:03.721
In the film,

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:07.503
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany
share a common story

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:11.217
about the soapstone birds
that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.

00:12:12.156 --> 00:12:14.469
After Zimbabwe gained its independence,

00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:18.414
all the birds except for one
were returned to the monument.

00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:24.110
"Falling" explores the mythological belief
that there will be unrest

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:26.811
until the final bird is returned.

00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:30.041
Through my work,

00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:33.495
I have realized a lot
about the world around me:

00:12:34.057 --> 00:12:36.053
how we move through spaces,

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:39.444
who we choose to celebrate

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:41.124
and who we remember.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.889
Now I look in the mirror
and not only see an image of myself,

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:49.754
but of the women
who have made me who I am today.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.584
I stand tall in my work,

00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:56.069
celebrating women's histories,

00:12:56.093 --> 00:12:58.621
in the hope that perhaps one day,

00:12:59.314 --> 00:13:02.570
no little black girl has to ever feel

00:13:02.594 --> 00:13:04.480
like she doesn't exist.

00:13:04.504 --> 00:13:05.724
Thank you.

00:13:05.748 --> 00:13:09.993
(Applause)
