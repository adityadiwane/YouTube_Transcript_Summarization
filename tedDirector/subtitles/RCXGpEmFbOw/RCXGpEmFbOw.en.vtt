00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.896
What started as a platform for hobbyists

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.856
is poised to become
a multibillion-dollar industry.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.936
Inspection, environmental monitoring,
photography and film and journalism:

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.136
these are some of the potential
applications for commercial drones,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.776
and their enablers
are the capabilities being developed

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.736
at research facilities around the world.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.376
For example, before aerial
package delivery

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.216
entered our social consciousness,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.216
an autonomous fleet of flying machines
built a six-meter-tall tower

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.176
composed of 1,500 bricks

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.136
in front of a live audience
at the FRAC Centre in France,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.736
and several years ago,
they started to fly with ropes.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.176
By tethering flying machines,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.976
they can achieve high speeds
and accelerations in very tight spaces.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.096
They can also autonomously build
tensile structures.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.536
Skills learned include how to carry loads,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.016
how to cope with disturbances,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.136
and in general, how to interact
with the physical world.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.496
Today we want to show you some
new projects that we've been working on.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.456
Their aim is to push the boundary
of what can be achieved

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.016
with autonomous flight.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.496
Now, for a system to function
autonomously,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.976
it must collectively know the location
of its mobile objects in space.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.896
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.776
we often use external cameras
to locate objects,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.776
which then allows us to focus our efforts

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.456
on the rapid development
of highly dynamic tasks.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.536
For the demos you will see today, however,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.856
we will use new localization technology
developed by Verity Studios,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.496
a spin-off from our lab.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.136
There are no external cameras.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.216
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors
to determine its location in space

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.680
and onboard computation
to determine what its actions should be.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.456
The only external commands
are high-level ones

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.000
such as "take off" and "land."

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.456
This is a so-called tail-sitter.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.936
It's an aircraft that tries
to have its cake and eat it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.216
Like other fixed-wing aircraft,
it is efficient in forward flight,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.455
much more so than helicopters
and variations thereof.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.896
Unlike most other
fixed-wing aircraft, however,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.416
it is capable of hovering,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.576
which has huge advantages
for takeoff, landing

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.840
and general versatility.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.576
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.536
One of the limitations with tail-sitters

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.536
is that they're susceptible
to disturbances such as wind gusts.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.256
We're developing new control
architectures and algorithms

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680
that address this limitation.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.816
The idea is for the aircraft to recover

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.480
no matter what state it finds itself in,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.320
and through practice,
improve its performance over time.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.000
(Applause)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.200
OK.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.696
When doing research,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.696
we often ask ourselves
fundamental abstract questions

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.280
that try to get at the heart of a matter.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.456
For example, one such question would be,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.496
what is the minimum number of moving parts
needed for controlled flight?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.096
Now, there are practical reasons

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.736
why you may want to know
the answer to such a question.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.016
Helicopters, for example,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.896
are affectionately known
as machines with a thousand moving parts

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.600
all conspiring to do you bodily harm.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.496
It turns out that decades ago,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.696
skilled pilots were able to fly
remote-controlled aircraft

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.616
that had only two moving parts:

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.480
a propeller and a tail rudder.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.120
We recently discovered
that it could be done with just one.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.856
This is the monospinner,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.136
the world's mechanically simplest
controllable flying machine,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.936
invented just a few months ago.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.096
It has only one moving part, a propeller.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.696
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.255
no other actuators,
no other control surfaces,

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.560
just a simple propeller.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.375
Even though it's mechanically simple,

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.896
there's a lot going on
in its little electronic brain

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.136
to allow it to fly in a stable fashion
and to move anywhere it wants in space.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.616
Even so, it doesn't yet have

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.976
the sophisticated algorithms
of the tail-sitter,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which means that in order
to get it to fly,

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.744
I have to throw it just right.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.816
And because the probability
of me throwing it just right is very low,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.736
given everybody watching me,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.216
what we're going to do instead

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.416
is show you a video
that we shot last night.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.640
(Applause)

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.816
If the monospinner
is an exercise in frugality,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.296
this machine here, the omnicopter,
with its eight propellers,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.400
is an exercise in excess.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.056
What can you do with all this surplus?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.461
The thing to notice
is that it is highly symmetric.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.776
As a result, it is ambivalent
to orientation.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.496
This gives it an extraordinary capability.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.736
It can move anywhere it wants in space

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.496
irrespective of where it is facing

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.320
and even of how it is rotating.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.416
It has its own complexities,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.096
mainly having to do
with the interacting flows

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.360
from its eight propellers.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.536
Some of this can be modeled,
while the rest can be learned on the fly.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.760
Let's take a look.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.520
(Applause)

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.625
If flying machines are going
to enter part of our daily lives,

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.126
they will need to become
extremely safe and reliable.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.136
This machine over here

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.296
is actually two separate
two-propeller flying machines.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.056
This one wants to spin clockwise.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.576
This other one wants
to spin counterclockwise.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.936
When you put them together,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.560
they behave like one
high-performance quadrocopter.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.296
If anything goes wrong, however --

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.776
a motor fails, a propeller fails,
electronics, even a battery pack --

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.136
the machine can still fly,
albeit in a degraded fashion.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.680
We're going to demonstrate this to you now
by disabling one of its halves.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.400
(Applause)

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.656
This last demonstration

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.120
is an exploration of synthetic swarms.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.536
The large number of autonomous,
coordinated entities

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.296
offers a new palette
for aesthetic expression.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.296
We've taken commercially available
micro quadcopters,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.816
each weighing less
than a slice of bread, by the way,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.256
and outfitted them
with our localization technology

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.856
and custom algorithms.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.976
Because each unit
knows where it is in space

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.376
and is self-controlled,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.600
there is really no limit to their number.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.280
(Applause)

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.840
(Applause)

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.680
(Applause)

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.056
Hopefully, these demonstrations
will motivate you to dream up

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.480
new revolutionary roles
for flying machines.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.656
That ultrasafe one over there for example

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.696
has aspirations to become
a flying lampshade on Broadway.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.776
(Laughter)

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.976
The reality is that it is
difficult to predict

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.640
the impact of nascent technology.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.976
And for folks like us, the real reward
is the journey and the act of creation.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.416
It's a continual reminder

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.360
of how wonderful and magical
the universe we live in is,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.776
that it allows creative, clever creatures

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.320
to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.576
The fact that this technology

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.016
has such huge commercial
and economic potential

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.456
is just icing on the cake.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.696
Thank you.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.960
(Applause)
