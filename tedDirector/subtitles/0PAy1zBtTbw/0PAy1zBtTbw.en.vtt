00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and the phone rang and I heard,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
"Hey, JR,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
you won the TED Prize 2011.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
You have to make a wish to save the world."

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I was lost.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The world is fucked up.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
population is growing by millions,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
there's no more fish in the sea,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
the North Pole is melting

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
we're all becoming fat.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
(Laughter)

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Except maybe French people.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Whatever.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
So I called back

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and I told her,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
"Look, Amy,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I can't do anything to save the world."

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
She said, "Hey, JR,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
"Oh, all right."

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
(Laughter)

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
"That's cool."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I mean, technology, politics, business

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
do change the world --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
not always in a good way, but they do.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
What about art?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Could art change the world?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I started when I was 15 years old.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I was doing graffiti --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
writing my name everywhere,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
using the city as a canvas.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
on the rooftops with my friends.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Each trip was an excursion,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
was an adventure.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
It was like leaving our mark on society,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I started documenting those adventures with my friends

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and gave them back as photocopies --

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
really small photos just that size.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
That's how, at 17 years old,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I started pasting them.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And I did my first "expo de rue,"

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
which means sidewalk gallery.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And I framed it with color

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
so you would not confuse it with advertising.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and let them decide

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I would control it directly with the public

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
in the streets.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So that's Paris.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
I would change --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
depending on the places I would go --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
the title of the exhibition.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
That's on the Champs-Elysees.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
I was quite proud of that one.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Because I was just 18

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Then when the photo left,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
the frame was still there.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
(Laughter)

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
November 2005:

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
the streets are burning.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
A large wave of riots

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
had broken into the first projects of Paris.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Everyone was glued to the TV,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
watching disturbing, frightening images

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
I mean, these kids, without control,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
throwing Molotov cocktails,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
attacking the cops and the firemen,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
looting everything they could in the shops.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
destroying their own environment.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
my photo on a wall

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
revealed by a burning car --

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
an illegal one -- still there.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
I know those guys.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
All of them are not angels,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
but they're not monsters either.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
So it was kind of weird to see

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So I went back there

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
with a 28 mm lens.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
It was the only one I had at that time.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
But with that lens,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
So you can do it only with their trust.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
They were making scary faces

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
to play the caricature of themselves.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
in the bourgeois area of Paris

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
with the name, age, even building number

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
of these guys.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
A year later,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And we go from thug images,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
who's now proudly taking over his own image.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
That's where I realized

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
the power of paper and glue.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
So could art change the world?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
A year later,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
I was listening to all the noise

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
about the Middle East conflict.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
I mean, at that time, trust me,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So with my friend Marco,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
we decided to go there

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Are they so different?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
When we got there, we just went in the street,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
started talking with people everywhere,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and we realized that things were a bit different

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
So we decided to take portraits

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
of Palestinians and Israelis

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
doing the same jobs --

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
about who you are and what you feel.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
They all accepted

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
to be pasted next to the other.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I decided to paste

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and on both sides of the wall.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
We called the project Face 2 Face.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
The experts said, "No way.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
The people will not accept.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I love the way that people will ask me,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
"How big will my photo be?"

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
"It will be as big as your house."

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So we arrived with just our ladders

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and we realized that they were not high enough.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And so Palestinians guys say,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So he went to the Church of Nativity

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and brought back an old ladder

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
(Laughter)

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
two ladders, two brushes,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
a rented car, a camera

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and 20,000 square feet of paper.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
We had all sorts of help

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
from all walks of life.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
We're in Ramallah right now.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
We're pasting portraits --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
People come around us and start asking,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
"What are you doing here?"

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And then there was always a silence.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
doing a face -- right here?"

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And I would always leave that moment,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and we would ask them,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
"So can you tell me who is who?"

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And most of them couldn't say.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.260
(Applause)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and nothing happened.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
some are a bit high for that, I agree --

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
but the people in the street,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
they are the curator.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
They are not meant to stay.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But exactly four years after,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
the photos, most of them are still there.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Face 2 Face demonstrated

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that what we thought impossible was possible --

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and, you know what, even easy.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
We didn't push the limit;

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
In the Middle East, I experienced my work

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
in places without [many] museums.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
So the reactions in the street

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
were kind of interesting.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
So I decided to go further in this direction

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260
and go in places where there were zero museums.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
When you go in these developing societies,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
women are the pillars of their community,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
So we were inspired to create a project

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
where men will pay tribute to women

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
by posting their photos.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.260
I called that project Women Are Heroes.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
When I listened to all the stories

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
everywhere I went on the continents,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
I couldn't always understand

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
I just observed.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Sometimes there was no words,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
no sentence, just tears.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
I just took their pictures

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and pasted them.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
Most of the places I went to,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
I decided to go there

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
because I've heard about it through the media.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
So for example, in June 2008,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
I was watching TV in Paris,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and then I heard about this terrible thing

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Three kids -- that was three students --

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
were [detained] by the army

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
because they were not carrying their papers.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And the army took them,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and instead of bringing them to the police station,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
they brought them to an enemy favela

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
where they get chopped into pieces.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
I was shocked.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
All Brazil was shocked.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
because the largest drug cartel controls it.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
So I decided to go there.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
When I arrived --

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
no eyewitnesses.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
So we just walked around,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and we met a woman,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and I showed her my book.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
And she said, "You know what?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
We're hungry for culture.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
We need culture out there."

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
So I went out and I started with the kids.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
I just took a few photos of the kids,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
But that's okay.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and some women came.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
they all wanted to shout the story.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
After that day,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
I took more photos, and we started the project.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
The drug lords were kind of worried

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
about us filming in the place,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
so I told them, "You know what?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
You see that enough in the media.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
So that's a really symbolic pasting,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
And that's where the three kids got arrested,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and that's the grandmother of one of them.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And on that stairs,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
that's where the traffickers always stand

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Everyone there understood the project.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:56.260
(Applause)

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
I mean, you should see that.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
and then have a really long lens,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And they would put a number: "Please call this number

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
if you know what's going on in Providencia."

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
We just did a project and then left

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
so the media wouldn't know.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So how can we know about the project?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
So they had to go and find the women

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and get an explanation from them.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
So you create a bridge between the media

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and the anonymous women.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
We kept traveling.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Liberia, Kenya.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
In war-torn places like Monrovia,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
people come straight to you.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Art. Just doing art.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Don't you have color in France?"

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
(Laughter)

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
"You know, you've been here for a few hours

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
During that time, you haven't thought about

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
what you're going to eat tomorrow.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
This is art."

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
I think it's people's curiosity

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that motivates them

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
to come into the projects.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And then it becomes more.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Women are always the first ones targeted

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
during conflict.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
This is Kibera, Kenya,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
one of the largest slums of Africa.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
You might have seen images about the post-election violence

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
that happened there in 2008.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
but we didn't use paper,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
because paper doesn't prevent the rain

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
from leaking inside the house --

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
vinyl does.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Then art becomes useful.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So the people kept it.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
there are so [many] houses inside.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
And I went there a few months ago --

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
So I asked the people what happened.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
"Oh, that guy just moved."

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.260
(Laughter)

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
"Now God can see me."

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
When you look at Kibera now,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
they look back.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Okay, India.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Before I start that, just so you know,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
so we set up like commandos --

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
we're a group of friends who arrive there,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
and we try to paste on the walls.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
In India it was just impossible to paste.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
I heard culturally and because of the law,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
So we decided to paste white,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
white on the walls.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
So people would come to us and ask us,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
"Hey, what are you up to?"

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
Of course, they were confused.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and the more dust you would have

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
going up in the air,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
on the white paper you can almost see,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
but there is this sticky part

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
like when you reverse a sticker.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
So we could just walk in the street during the next days

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:53.260
(Applause)

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Thank you.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
So we didn't get caught this time.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Each project -- that's a film

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
from Women Are Heroes.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Music)

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Okay.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
For each project we do

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
a film.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
its images, photography,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
taken one after the other.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
And the photos kept traveling even without us.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
(Laughter)

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:33.260
(Applause)

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260
Hopefully, you'll see the film,

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.260
and you'll understand the scope of the project

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Behind each image is a story.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
in each of the communities,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
For example, we did books -- not for sale --

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
that all the community would get.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.260
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.260
We did that in most of the places.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.260
We go back regularly.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
we have a cultural center running there.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.260
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
So we decided to come the year after

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
and keep doing the project.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.260
A really important point for me

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.260
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
So I have no responsibility

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
to anyone but myself

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
and the subjects.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.260
(Applause)

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260
And that is for me

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.260
one of the more important things in the work.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
I think, today,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.260
as important as the result is the way you do things.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
And that has always been a central part of the work.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.260
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.260
with images and advertising.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.260
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.260
on another project in the last weeks.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.260
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.260
But yesterday the city called them and said,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
Because this can be taken for advertising,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.260
and because of the law,

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260
it has to be taken down."

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.260
But tell me, advertising for what?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.260
The people I photograph

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.260
were proud to participate in the project

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.260
and to have their photo in the community.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.260
But they asked me for a promise basically.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.260
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.260
So I did. That's Paris.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
That's Rio.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.260
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.260
You understand the full scope of the project.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.260
That's London.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.260
New York.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.260
All right, recently I started a public art project

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.260
where I don't use my artwork anymore.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.260
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.260
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.260
The importance is what you do

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.260
with the images,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.260
the statement it makes where it's pasted.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.260
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.260
in Switzerland

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.260
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:25.260
(Applause)

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.260
This image of three men wearing gas masks

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
was taken in Chernobyl originally,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.260
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.260
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.260
In some ways, art can change the world.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.260
Art is not supposed to change the world,

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.260
to change practical things,

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.260
but to change perceptions.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.260
Art can change

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.260
the way we see the world.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.260
Art can create an analogy.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.260
Actually the fact that art cannot change things

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
makes it a neutral place

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.260
for exchanges and discussions,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.260
and then enables you to change the world.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.260
When I do my work,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.260
I have two kinds of reactions.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.260
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.260
They would be really useful."

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.260
Or, "How can we help?"

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.260
I presume that you belong to the second category,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.260
and that's good,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.260
because for that project,

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.260
I'm going to ask you to take the photos

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.260
and paste them.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.260
So now my wish is:

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.260
(mock drum roll)

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.260
(Laughter)

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.260
I wish for you to stand up

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.260
for what you care about

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.260
by participating in a global art project,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.260
and together we'll turn the world inside out.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.260
And this starts right now.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.260
Yes, everyone in the room.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.260
Everyone watching.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.260
I wanted that wish

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.260
to actually start now.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.260
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.260
or even your own photos --

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.260
tell me what you stand for.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.260
Take the photos, the portraits,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.260
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.260
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.260
and reveal things to the world.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.260
The full data is on the website --

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.260
insideoutproject.net --

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.260
that is launching today.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.260
What we see changes who we are.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.260
When we act together,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.260
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.260
So I hope that, together, we'll create something

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.260
that the world will remember.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.260
And this starts right now and depends on you.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.260
Thank you.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:52.260
(Applause)

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.260
Thank you.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:02.260
(Applause)
