00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.807
Chris Anderson: So I guess
what we're going to do is

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:17.268
we're going to talk about your life,

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:20.426
and using some pictures
that you shared with me.

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:23.375
And I think we should start
right here with this one.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.743
Okay, now who is this?

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:31.492
Martine Rothblatt: This is me
with our oldest son Eli.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:33.382
He was about age five.

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:35.495
This is taken in Nigeria

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:39.489
right after having taken
the Washington, D.C. bar exam.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.064
CA: Okay. But this doesn't
really look like a Martine.

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:49.701
MR: Right. That was myself as a male,
the way I was brought up.

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:55.733
Before I transitioned from male
to female and Martin to Martine.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.762
CA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:58.807
MR: Correct.

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:03.431
CA: And about a year after this picture,
you married a beautiful woman.

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:05.947
Was this love at first sight?
What happened there?

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:07.757
MR: It was love at the first sight.

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:12.170
I saw Bina at a discotheque
in Los Angeles,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.653
and we later began living together,

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:19.484
but the moment I saw her,
I saw just an aura of energy around her.

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:21.156
I asked her to dance.

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:24.058
She said she saw an aura
of energy around me.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:27.753
I was a single male parent.
She was a single female parent.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.188
We showed each other
our kids' pictures,

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.298
and we've been happily married
for a third of a century now.

00:01:34.298 --> 00:01:38.832
(Applause)

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.890
CA: And at the time, you were
kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.585
working with satellites.

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:45.847
I think you had two successful companies,

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:47.951
and then you started
addressing this problem

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:52.162
of how could you use satellites
to revolutionize radio.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:53.825
Tell us about that.

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:55.961
MR: Right. I always
loved space technology,

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.862
and satellites, to me, are sort of
like the canoes that our ancestors

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:02.021
first pushed out into the water.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.388
So it was exciting for me
to be part of the navigation

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:07.826
of the oceans of the sky,

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:12.354
and as I developed different types
of satellite communication systems,

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:17.655
the main thing I did was to launch
bigger and more powerful satellites,

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:21.316
the consequence of which
was that the receiving antennas

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:23.290
could be smaller and smaller,

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.144
and after going through
direct television broadcasting,

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:30.678
I had the idea that if we could make
a more powerful satellite,

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:33.418
the receiving dish could be so small

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.710
that it would just be a section
of a parabolic dish,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.449
a flat little plate embedded
into the roof of an automobile,

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.350
and it would be possible to have
nationwide satellite radio,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.904
and that's Sirius XM today.

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:48.924
CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.506
(Applause)

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.684
MR: Thank you for
your monthly subscriptions.

00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:56.447
(Laughter)

00:02:56.447 --> 00:03:00.649
CA: So that succeeded despite
all predictions at the time.

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.878
It was a huge commercial success,

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:07.197
but soon after this, in the early 1990s,

00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:11.713
there was this big transition in your life
and you became Martine.

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:15.300
MR: Correct.
CA: So tell me, how did that happen?

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.877
MR: It happened in consultation with Bina
and our four beautiful children,

00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:28.749
and I discussed with each of them

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:34.739
that I felt my soul was always female,
and as a woman,

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.334
but I was afraid people would
laugh at me if I expressed it,

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.863
so I always kept it bottled up

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:44.998
and just showed my male side.

00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:48.016
And each of them
had a different take on this.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:52.497
Bina said, "I love your soul,

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:56.073
and whether the outside
is Martin and Martine,

00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:58.488
it doesn't it matter to me,
I love your soul."

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:06.150
My son said, "If you become a woman,
will you still be my father?"

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.377
And I said, "Yes,
I'll always be your father,"

00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:12.675
and I'm still his father today.

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:17.226
My youngest daughter did an absolutely
brilliant five-year-old thing.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:22.287
She told people, "I love my dad
and she loves me."

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:28.432
So she had no problem
with a gender blending whatsoever.

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:31.349
CA: And a couple years after this,
you published this book:

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.229
"The Apartheid of Sex."

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.458
What was your thesis in this book?

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:39.800
MR: My thesis in this book is that there
are seven billion people in the world,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.117
and actually, seven billion unique ways
to express one's gender.

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:51.549
And while people may have
the genitals of a male or a female,

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:54.591
the genitals don't determine your gender

00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:57.400
or even really your sexual identity.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.095
That's just a matter of anatomy

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:00.906
and reproductive tracts,

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:04.111
and people could choose
whatever gender they want

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:09.477
if they weren't forced by society
into categories of either male or female

00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:13.771
the way South Africa used to force people
into categories of black or white.

00:05:13.778 --> 00:05:17.980
We know from anthropological science
that race is fiction,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.782
even though racism is very, very real,

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:23.382
and we now know from cultural studies

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:27.140
that separate male or female genders
is a constructed fiction.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.335
The reality is a gender fluidity

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:34.225
that crosses the entire continuum
from male to female.

00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:37.784
CA: You yourself don't always
feel 100 percent female.

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:40.019
MR: Correct. I would say in some ways

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:43.920
I change my gender about as often
as I change my hairstyle.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.142
CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is
your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:55.525
And I guess she was about this age
when something pretty terrible happened.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:06:00.800
MR: Yes, she was finding herself
unable to walk up the stairs

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.611
in our house to her bedroom,

00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.813
and after several months of doctors,

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:09.267
she was diagnosed to have a rare,
almost invariably fatal disease

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:13.338
called pulmonary arterial hypertension.

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:15.869
CA: So how did you respond to that?

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:19.398
MR: Well, we first tried to get her
to the best doctors we could.

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:23.415
We ended up at Children's National
Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:25.621
The head of pediatric cardiology

00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:30.105
told us that he was going to refer her
to get a lung transplant,

00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:31.984
but not to hold out any hope,

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:34.096
because there are
very few lungs available,

00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:35.861
especially for children.

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:40.319
He said that all people
with this illness died,

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.939
and if any of you have seen
the film "Lorenzo's Oil,"

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.843
there's a scene when the protagonist

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:53.089
kind of rolls down the stairway
crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.456
and that's exactly
how we felt about Jenesis.

00:06:56.456 --> 00:07:00.078
CA: But you didn't accept that
as the limit of what you could do.

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:04.915
You started trying to research
and see if you could find a cure somehow.

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:08.739
MR: Correct. She was in the intensive
care ward for weeks at a time,

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:12.709
and Bina and I would tag team
to stay at the hospital

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:15.101
while the other watched
the rest of the kids,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.678
and when I was in the hospital
and she was sleeping,

00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:19.373
I went to the hospital library.

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:24.221
I read every article that I could find
on pulmonary hypertension.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.680
I had not taken any biology,
even in college,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.307
so I had to go from a biology textbook
to a college-level textbook

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:37.572
and then medical textbook
and the journal articles, back and forth,

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:41.635
and eventually I knew enough to think
that it might be possible

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:43.400
that somebody could find a cure.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.254
So we started a nonprofit foundation.

00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:51.597
I wrote a description
asking people to submit grants

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:54.336
and we would pay for medical research.

00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:57.981
I became an expert on the condition --
doctors said to me, Martine,

00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:01.696
we really appreciate all the funding
you've provided us,

00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:05.736
but we are not going to be able
to find a cure in time

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:07.454
to save your daughter.

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.451
However, there is a medicine

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:14.652
that was developed at the
Burroughs Wellcome Company

00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:17.764
that could halt the progression
of the disease,

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:22.570
but Burroughs Wellcome has just
been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.723
They made a decision not to develop

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:28.015
any medicines for rare
and orphan diseases,

00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:32.612
and maybe you could use your expertise
in satellite communications

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:36.231
to develop this cure
for pulmonary hypertension.

00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:40.254
CA: So how on earth did you get
access to this drug?

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:42.428
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome

00:08:42.428 --> 00:08:47.907
and after three times being rejected
and having the door slammed in my face

00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:51.415
because they weren't going
to out-license the drug

00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:54.208
to a satellite communications expert,

00:08:54.208 --> 00:09:00.643
they weren't going to send the drug
out to anybody at all,

00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:03.682
and they thought
I didn't have the expertise,

00:09:03.682 --> 00:09:10.276
finally I was able to persuade
a small team of people to work with me

00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.644
and develop enough credibility.

00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:14.525
I wore down their resistance,

00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:18.095
and they had no hope this drug
would even work, by the way,

00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:20.813
and they tried to tell me,
"You're just wasting your time.

00:09:20.813 --> 00:09:22.414
We're sorry about your daughter."

00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:25.432
But finally, for 25,000 dollars

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:29.890
and agreement to pay 10 percent
of any revenues we might ever get,

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.200
they agreed to give me
worldwide rights to this drug.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:40.616
CA: And so you put this drug on the market
in a really brilliant way,

00:09:40.616 --> 00:09:45.354
by basically charging what it would take
to make the economics work.

00:09:45.354 --> 00:09:49.185
MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't
a drug that I ended up --

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:52.180
after I wrote the check for 25,000,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.990
and I said, "Okay, where's
the medicine for Jenesis?"

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.171
they said, "Oh, Martine,
there's no medicine for Jenesis.

00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.377
This is just something we tried in rats."

00:10:00.377 --> 00:10:04.092
And they gave me, like,
a little plastic Ziploc bag

00:10:04.092 --> 00:10:05.647
of a small amount of powder.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.457
They said, "Don't give it to any human,"

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:12.265
and they gave me a piece of paper
which said it was a patent,

00:10:12.265 --> 00:10:16.096
and from that, we had to figure out
a way to make this medicine.

00:10:16.096 --> 00:10:19.161
A hundred chemists in the U.S.
at the top universities

00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.830
all swore that little patent
could never be turned into a medicine.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.125
If it was turned into a medicine,
it could never be delivered

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:30.352
because it had a half-life
of only 45 minutes.

00:10:30.352 --> 00:10:34.810
CA: And yet, a year or two later,
you were there with a medicine

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.967
that worked for Jenesis.

00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:44.001
MR: Chris, the astonishing thing
is that this absolutely worthless

00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:45.654
piece of powder

00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:49.717
that had the sparkle of a promise
of hope for Jenesis

00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:54.964
is not only keeping Jenesis
and other people alive today,

00:10:54.964 --> 00:10:59.097
but produces almost a billion
and a half dollars a year in revenue.

00:10:59.097 --> 00:11:02.923
(Applause)

00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:05.454
CA: So here you go.

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:09.007
So you took this company public, right?

00:11:09.007 --> 00:11:11.537
And made an absolute fortune.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:15.531
And how much have you paid Glaxo,
by the way, after that 25,000?

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:19.339
MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them
10 percent of 1.5 billion,

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:23.054
150 million dollars,
last year 100 million dollars.

00:11:23.054 --> 00:11:26.165
It's the best return on investment
they ever received. (Laughter)

00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:28.232
CA: And the best news of all, I guess,

00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:30.089
is this.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:34.362
MR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely
brilliant young lady.

00:11:34.362 --> 00:11:36.985
She's alive, healthy today at 30.

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:39.447
You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.

00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:42.326
The most amazing thing about Jenesis

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:45.228
is that while she could do
anything with her life,

00:11:45.228 --> 00:11:48.924
and believe me, if you grew up
your whole life with people

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:51.846
in your face saying
that you've got a fatal disease,

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:56.559
I would probably run to Tahiti and just
not want to run into anybody again.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:59.694
But instead she chooses to work
in United Therapeutics.

00:11:59.694 --> 00:12:03.304
She says she wants to do all she can
to help other people

00:12:03.304 --> 00:12:05.522
with orphan diseases get medicines,

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:10.212
and today, she's our project leader
for all telepresence activities,

00:12:10.212 --> 00:12:13.741
where she helps digitally unite
the entire company to work together

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:16.690
to find cures for pulmonary hypertension.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.987
CA: But not everyone who has this disease
has been so fortunate.

00:12:19.987 --> 00:12:24.442
There are still many people dying,
and you are tackling that too. How?

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:28.926
MR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000
people a year in the United States alone,

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:31.805
perhaps 10 times that number worldwide,

00:12:31.805 --> 00:12:33.960
who continue to die of this illness

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.490
because the medicines
slow down the progression

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.185
but they don't halt it.

00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:42.924
The only cure for pulmonary hypertension,
pulmonary fibrosis,

00:12:42.924 --> 00:12:45.360
cystic fibrosis, emphysema,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.355
COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,

00:12:48.355 --> 00:12:50.863
is a lung transplant,

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:55.623
but sadly, there are only enough
available lungs for 2,000 people

00:12:55.623 --> 00:12:58.525
in the U.S. a year
to get a lung transplant,

00:12:58.525 --> 00:13:01.822
whereas nearly a half
million people a year

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:04.121
die of end-stage lung failure.

00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.815
CA: So how can you address that?

00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:09.299
MR: So I conceptualize the possibility

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:12.712
that just like we keep cars and planes

00:13:12.712 --> 00:13:15.104
and buildings going forever

00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:19.331
with an unlimited supply
of building parts and machine parts,

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.521
why can't we create an unlimited supply
of transplantable organs

00:13:22.521 --> 00:13:25.459
to keep people living indefinitely,

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:28.106
and especially people with lung disease.

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:33.632
So we've teamed up with the decoder
of the human genome, Craig Venter,

00:13:33.632 --> 00:13:35.444
and the company he founded

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:38.950
with Peter Diamandis,
the founder of the X Prize,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.016
to genetically modify

00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:42.711
the pig genome

00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:47.216
so that the pig's organs will not
be rejected by the human body

00:13:47.216 --> 00:13:50.327
and thereby to create an unlimited supply

00:13:50.327 --> 00:13:52.742
of transplantable organs.

00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:55.714
We do this through our company,
United Therapeutics.

00:13:55.714 --> 00:13:58.779
CA: So you really believe that within,
what, a decade,

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:03.260
that this shortage of transplantable lungs
maybe be cured, through these guys?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.839
MR: Absolutely, Chris.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:08.531
I'm as certain of that as I was
of the success that we've had

00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:11.619
with direct television
broadcasting, Sirius XM.

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:13.825
It's actually not rocket science.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:17.284
It's straightforward engineering away
one gene after another.

00:14:17.284 --> 00:14:21.626
We're so lucky to be born in the time
that sequencing genomes

00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:24.285
is a routine activity,

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:26.723
and the brilliant folks
at Synthetic Genomics

00:14:26.723 --> 00:14:28.929
are able to zero in on the pig genome,

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:32.321
find exactly the genes
that are problematic, and fix them.

00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:35.360
CA: But it's not just bodies that --
though that is amazing.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.681
(Applause)

00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:42.976
It's not just long-lasting bodies
that are of interest to you now.

00:14:42.976 --> 00:14:45.008
It's long-lasting minds.

00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:50.848
And I think this graph for you
says something quite profound.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.032
What does this mean?

00:14:52.032 --> 00:14:55.680
MR: What this graph means,
and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.460
is that the rate of development
in computer processing

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.293
hardware, firmware and software,

00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:06.288
has been advancing along a curve

00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:10.460
such that by the 2020s, as we saw
in earlier presentations today,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.625
there will be information technology

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:17.108
that processes information
and the world around us

00:15:17.108 --> 00:15:19.523
at the same rate as a human mind.

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:24.027
CA: And so that being so, you're actually
getting ready for this world

00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:28.114
by believing that we will soon
be able to, what,

00:15:28.114 --> 00:15:34.457
actually take the contents of our brains
and somehow preserve them forever?

00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:36.287
How do you describe that?

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:40.728
MR: Well, Chris, what we're working on
is creating a situation

00:15:40.728 --> 00:15:43.213
where people can create a mind file,

00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:47.221
and a mind file is the collection
of their mannerisms, personality,

00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:49.101
recollection, feelings,

00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:50.657
beliefs, attitudes and values,

00:15:50.657 --> 00:15:56.999
everything that we've poured today
into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,

00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:03.174
and all of this information stored there
will be able, in the next couple decades,

00:16:03.174 --> 00:16:07.560
once software is able
to recapitulate consciousness,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.474
be able to revive the consciousness
which is imminent in our mind file.

00:16:12.474 --> 00:16:15.039
CA: Now you're not just
messing around with this.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:18.160
You're serious. I mean, who is this?

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.549
MR: This is a robot version of
my beloved spouse, Bina.

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:25.010
And we call her Bina 48.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.609
She was programmed
by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:31.581
There's the centerfold
from National Geographic magazine

00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:34.251
with one of her caregivers,

00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:36.294
and she roams the web

00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:41.548
and has hundreds of hours
of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.

00:16:41.548 --> 00:16:43.794
She's kind of like a two-year-old kid,

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.975
but she says things
that blow people away,

00:16:46.975 --> 00:16:49.610
best expressed by perhaps

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.418
a New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist Amy Harmon

00:16:53.418 --> 00:16:55.996
who says her answers
are often frustrating,

00:16:55.996 --> 00:17:02.195
but other times as compelling as those
of any flesh person she's interviewed.

00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:06.593
CA: And is your thinking here,
part of your hope here, is that

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:13.038
this version of Bina can in a sense
live on forever, or some future upgrade

00:17:13.038 --> 00:17:15.430
to this version can live on forever?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.836
MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:21.853
You know, it costs us virtually nothing
to store our mind files

00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:24.779
on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:28.842
Social media is I think one of the most
extraordinary inventions of our time,

00:17:28.842 --> 00:17:32.836
and as apps become available
that will allow us

00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:35.924
to out-Siri Siri, better and better,

00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:38.571
and develop consciousness
operating systems,

00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.473
everybody in the world,
billions of people,

00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:45.211
will be able to develop
mind clones of themselves

00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:47.765
that will have their own life on the web.

00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.219
CA: So the thing is, Martine,

00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:53.342
that in any normal conversation,
this would sound stark-staring mad,

00:17:53.342 --> 00:17:56.696
but in the context of your life,
what you've done,

00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:58.786
some of the things we've heard this week,

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.982
the constructed realities
that our minds give,

00:18:00.982 --> 00:18:04.776
I mean, you wouldn't bet against it.

00:18:04.776 --> 00:18:07.632
MR: Well, I think it's really nothing
coming from me.

00:18:07.632 --> 00:18:14.296
If anything, I'm perhaps a bit
of a communicator of activities

00:18:14.296 --> 00:18:17.686
that are being undertaken
by the greatest companies

00:18:17.686 --> 00:18:21.006
in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:25.709
There are tens of millions of people
working on writing code

00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:29.424
that expresses more and more aspects
of our human consciousness,

00:18:29.424 --> 00:18:34.509
and you don't have to be a genius
to see that all these threads

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:38.641
are going to come together
and ultimately create human consciousness,

00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:40.847
and it's something we'll value.

00:18:40.847 --> 00:18:43.285
There are so many things
to do in this life,

00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:47.888
and if we could have a simulacrum,
a digital doppelgänger of ourselves

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:50.785
that helps us process books, do shopping,

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.735
be our best friends,

00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:55.777
I believe our mind clones,
these digital versions of ourselves,

00:18:55.777 --> 00:18:58.378
will ultimately be our best friends,

00:18:58.378 --> 00:19:00.398
and for me personally and Bina personally,

00:19:00.398 --> 00:19:02.186
we love each other like crazy.

00:19:02.186 --> 00:19:03.982
Each day, we are always saying, like,

00:19:03.982 --> 00:19:06.517
"Wow, I love you even more
than 30 years ago.

00:19:06.517 --> 00:19:09.663
And so for us, the prospect of mind clones

00:19:09.663 --> 00:19:11.707
and regenerated bodies

00:19:11.707 --> 00:19:14.797
is that our love affair, Chris,
can go on forever.

00:19:14.797 --> 00:19:17.999
And we never get bored of each other.
I'm sure we never will.

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:20.371
CA: I think Bina's here, right?
MR: She is, yeah.

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:23.554
CA: Would it be too much, I don't know,
do we have a handheld mic?

00:19:23.554 --> 00:19:27.246
Bina, could we invite you to the stage?
I just have to ask you one question.

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:28.894
Besides, we need to see you.

00:19:28.894 --> 00:19:31.843
(Applause)

00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:36.998
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:36.998 --> 00:19:39.691
Come and join Martine here.

00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:44.544
I mean, look, when you got married,

00:19:44.544 --> 00:19:47.633
if someone had told you that,
in a few years time,

00:19:47.633 --> 00:19:49.931
the man you were marrying
would become a woman,

00:19:49.931 --> 00:19:52.833
and a few years after that,
you would become a robot --

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:55.898
(Laughter) --

00:19:55.898 --> 00:19:59.183
how has this gone? How has it been?

00:19:59.183 --> 00:20:01.749
Bina Rothblatt: It's been really
an exciting journey,

00:20:01.749 --> 00:20:04.089
and I would have never
thought that at the time,

00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:07.926
but we started making goals
and setting those goals

00:20:07.926 --> 00:20:09.197
and accomplishing things,

00:20:09.197 --> 00:20:11.664
and before you knew it,
we just keep going up and up

00:20:11.664 --> 00:20:14.311
and we're still not stopping,
so it's great.

00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:17.376
CA: Martine told me something
really beautiful,

00:20:17.376 --> 00:20:20.135
just actually on Skype before this,

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:25.966
which was that he wanted
to live for hundreds of years

00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:28.292
as a mind file,

00:20:28.292 --> 00:20:31.424
but not if it wasn't with you.

00:20:31.424 --> 00:20:33.532
BR: That's right,
we want to do it together.

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:36.785
We're cryonicists as well,
and we want to wake up together.

00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:39.221
CA: So just so as you know,
from my point of view,

00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:42.936
this isn't only one of the most
astonishing lives I have heard,

00:20:42.936 --> 00:20:45.940
it's one of the most astonishing
love stories I've ever heard.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.300
It's just a delight to have you
both here at TED.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.646
Thank you so much.

00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:51.968
MR: Thank you.

00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:58.609
(Applause)
