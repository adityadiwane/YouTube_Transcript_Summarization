00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I am going to be talking about secrets.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Obviously the best way to divulge a secret

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
is to tell someone to not say anything about it.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
(Laughter)

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.260
(Laughter)

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
You just press it.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260
(Laughter)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Oh, man. Um, yes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
(Laughter)

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Yes. I'm sure! Just change it!

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Is Bill Gates here?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Change it! Come on! What?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.260
(Laughter)

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Ah! Okay.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
That's not my slides, but it's okay.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
(Laughter)

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
As you can see, these are all maps.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And maps are important devices for transferring information,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
especially if you have human cognitive ability.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.260
We can see that all formulas are really maps.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Now, as humans, we make maps of places

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
that we seldom even go,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
which seems a little wasteful of time.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
This, of course, is a map of the moon.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
There're some very delightful names.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
What are these people thinking? Frigoris?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
(Laughter)

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
There we see Mars, again with various names.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And this is all done, by the way,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
by the International Astronomical Union.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
This is an actual group of people

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that sit around naming planetary objects.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
This is from their actual book.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.260
(Laughter)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.260
(Laughter)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
It's time for Bolotnitsa!"

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
(Laughter)

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Djabran Fluctus.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
If that don't flow off the tongue, what does?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Laughter)

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I mean kids are studying this stuff

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.260
(Laughter)

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
(Laughter)

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
"It fluctus up, Mama."

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Hikuleo Fluctus.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
17 syllable thing.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And that's the Tonga underworld.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.260
who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Now, if you're a goddess of stars and planets

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.260
(Laughter)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
(Laughter)

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Now, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
to have to live with these ridiculous names.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So, you'll be on Mars, and you're at

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Hellespointica Depressio

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
which has got to be a really "up" place.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
(Laughter)

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
so I plug it into the Mars map,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and click the button and there's my directions.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I go to Chrysokeras.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Then to Niliacus Lacus,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
which is not a bad name.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
That's a cool name. I will say that.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
So, I hold back a little of my venom

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
for these astronomical misnomers.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And then of course Arnon to Thoth.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And of course there will be advertisements.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And you know they're international because

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
they put it "en Francais" as well.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
L'Union Astronomique Internationale,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
for those of you who don't speak French.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
I thought I'd translate for you.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
And I think that Djabran Fluctus,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that fits that mode.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
(Laughter)

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
That's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Djabran Fluctus.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.260
"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.260
(Laughter)

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It's clear to me."

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
(Laughter)

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Also, from the actual document

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Anyone can suggest changing a name.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
We've got to change this stuff up fast.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So, these are actual names of people that work there.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
I did some more investigation.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
These are more people working for this group.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And, as you can see, they don't use their first names.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Laughter)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Something is askew here.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260
(Laughter)

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
(Laughter)

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.260
(Laughter)

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Is that Mars Ya Marov?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.260
There are some mapping people who do use their names.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Witness please, Eugene Shoemaker,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
who, diligently, from a young boy

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
"Mom, I want to make maps."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
"No, I want to make maps of planets."

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
"Yeah, go to your room."

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
(Laughter)

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Martians, Venusians, Jovians.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.260
We have names for places where people don't exist.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
That seems a little silly to me.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
There are no Jovians.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
(Laughter)

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.260
(Applause)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
There is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
de Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
or Richard Harris.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
(Laughter)

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
But obviously the point is that numbers are maps.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
That is the premise of this particular presentation.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to explain my love of this particular planet,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
So, formulas relate number to form.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
That's Euler, his formula

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
(Laughter)

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
He was also famous for having no body.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
(Laughter)

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Which a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
He's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Here comes Euler.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And that's an icosahedron,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You see the icosahedron again.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
The dodecahedron, it's dual.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
The five sacred solids, as you can see there.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
(Laughter)

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
I suggest the house.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
The reality, now here is something important.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
What's important about this is

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
these shapes are duals of each other.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And you can see how the icosahedron

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
withdraws into the dodecahedron

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and then they just merge into each other.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
So, the whole concept of branes in the universe,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
this is a very good map of what could possibly be.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
What a coincidence!

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
based on information that they got from this probe.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
This would be a normal wave pattern.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
of the microwave background,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
is this kind of odd undulation.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So, you can kind of get an idea from this

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
extrapolating that back under this huge picture,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
(Laughter)

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And for me, that's a win-win.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Everybody goes, I'm happy.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Laughter)

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Better really hurry up.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
I just threw this in because

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
as important as all of our intellectual abilities are,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And that, to me, is really beautiful.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.260
(Laughter)

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Except for that creepy guy in the background.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.260
(Laughter)

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Getting back to the point of my particular presentation,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Kepler, one of my great heroes,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
who realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
were related somehow to the planets,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So, maps of things leading to organized understandings

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
of the universe in which we emerge.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
(Laughter)

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.260
(Laughter)

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
that's not a good picture.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Laughter)

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
That guy is rockin'.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.260
(Laughter)

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
What a handsome cat.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Once again, Nicaragua let me down.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
(Laughter)

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.260
(Laughter)

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
I don't get that at all.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Once again, these guys rock it out.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
This is freaky is a major way.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
This is Sierra Leone.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
They got little babies in there, floating in there.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260
(Laughter)

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Man. I don't really need to comment on this.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260
(Laughter)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
When did this happen?

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.260
(Laughter)

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
that are not necessarily valid.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Although five is a good number, of course.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Ecuador, my friend Kepler,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
as you can see, they call him Juan.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
(Laughter)

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Juan? No! Johannes, not Juan.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
(Laughter)

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
René Descartes, of course. Once again

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
these Grenada people, this is like way too sick

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
for anybody's imagination.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
fast, ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.260
(Laughter)

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.260
This is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Once again, that's Sierra Leone.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
This is again, indicating how numbers

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
relate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
Descartes. (Laughter)

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Before the horse. (Laughter)

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Now, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
(Laughter)

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
I don't even want to hazard a guess.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.260
(Laughter)

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
the flag of Indonesia. Please examine.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
(Laughter)

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Applause)

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
They are so different.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Look, ours is more red, it's longer.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.260
(Laughter)

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
(Laughter)

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
could you touch your tooth? That's good."

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Just a tip, if you're being photographed

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
for press pictures, don't touch your teeth.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
(Laughter)

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
since before I was born.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
I know that scares a lot of you,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
but that was my purpose entirely.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
because Fibonacci and Golden Section

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260
relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
(Laughter)

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
that would be the Fibonacci series.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
"Yes, Mama."

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.260
(Laughter)

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Alright where is this going? That's a good question.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
If numbers can express

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
the laws of this incredible universe that we live,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
we could extrapolate from them

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
some basic structural element of this universe.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I started working on this.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And I tried to build a particle accelerator.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.260
(Laughter)

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And that didn't work out well.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Moleeds are what I believe

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
the thing that will allow string theory to be proved.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
They are the nodes on the string,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
patterns and relationships, 27, 37.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
That was the first chart I came up with.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
the beauty of the symmetry.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
The numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
Symmetry, pairs.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Every top adds up to 37.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Bottom, all 74.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
because you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
(Laughter)

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.260
Circle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.260
I knew those two were related.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
So, I said if I'm going to put a circle,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
see what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
(Laughter)

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
You can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
There is the Orange System.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.260
(Laughter)

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
And they recapitulate that shape,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.260
even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260
(Laughter)

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
That's the Green System. It all folds in half

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
on the Green System, right between 18 and 19.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:46.260
(Laughter)

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.260
(Laughter)

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
Twenty-seven years of my life!

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.260
(Laughter)

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Because this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.260
(Laughter)

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
(Laughter)

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
In this last year I have found these subsequent systems

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.260
which allow for the mathematic possibilities

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
of the Calabi-Yau manifolds

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
I don't want hidden, I want to see it.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
(Laughter)

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
I found other pairs all have symmetry,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
even though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
Unbelievable. This is like crazy.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Am I the only one that sees this?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.260
(Laughter)

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
You know, try making some charts like this at home.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
These are maps, by the way.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
Not stamps, but one day.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
(Laughter)

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.260
And look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I start looking at that, and look at them again.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
They start looking like planets.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
I go to JPL.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
I look at the orbits of the planets.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.260
I find 18 examples of it in our solar system.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.260
(Laughter)

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Kepler was right.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.260
(Laughter)

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Which is .005 different from the number of days in a year.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
Hey, you can't make this up.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
(Laughter)

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.260
(Applause)

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Thank you.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
(Applause)

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Thank you.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.260
(Applause)
