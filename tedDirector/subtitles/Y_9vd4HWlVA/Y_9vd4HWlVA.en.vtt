00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:22.116
Doc Edgerton inspired us
with awe and curiosity

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.378
with this photo of a bullet
piercing through an apple,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.254
and exposure just a millionth of a second.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:39.810
But now, 50 years later,
we can go a million times faster

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:44.596
and see the world
not at a million or a billion,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.673
but one trillion frames per second.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.789
I present to you
a new type of photography,

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:54.848
femto-photography,

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:59.448
a new imaging technique so fast

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:03.744
that it can create slow motion
videos of light in motion.

00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:09.532
And with that, we can create cameras
that can look around corners,

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:11.529
beyond line of sight,

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:16.409
or see inside our body without an x-ray,

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:20.240
and really challenge
what we mean by a camera.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.834
Now if I take a laser pointer
and turn it on and off

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:27.661
in one trillionth of a second --

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:30.472
which is several femtoseconds --

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:34.493
I'll create a packet of photons
barely a millimeter wide.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.029
And that packet of photons, that bullet,

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:39.979
will travel at the speed of light,

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.961
and again, a million times faster
than an ordinary bullet.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:49.393
Now, if you take that bullet
and take this packet of photons

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:52.749
and fire into this bottle,

00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:56.344
how will those photons
shatter into this bottle?

00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:59.712
How does light look in slow motion?

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.812
[Light in Slow Motion ...
10 Billion x Slow]

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.848
Now, the whole event --

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:29.859
(Applause)

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.384
Now remember, the whole event
is effectively taking place

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:35.071
in less than a nanosecond --

00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:37.496
that's how much time
it takes for light to travel.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.167
But I'm slowing down in this video
by a factor of 10 billion,

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.739
so you can see the light in motion.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:45.833
(Laughter)

00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:48.144
But Coca-Cola did not
sponsor this research.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.270
(Laughter)

00:02:50.294 --> 00:02:52.317
Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:54.961
so let me break this down
and show you what's going on.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:57.919
So the pulse enters
the bottle, our bullet,

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:00.481
with a packet of photons
that start traveling through

00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:02.318
and that start scattering inside.

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:04.549
Some of the light leaks,
goes on the table,

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:07.185
and you start seeing
these ripples of waves.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.217
Many of the photons
eventually reach the cap

00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.131
and then they explode
in various directions.

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:15.043
As you can see, there's a bubble of air

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.709
and it's bouncing around inside.

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.183
Meanwhile, the ripples
are traveling on the table,

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:21.207
and because of the reflections at the top,

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:24.978
you see at the back of the bottle,
after several frames,

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.701
the reflections are focused.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.859
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:36.883
and let it go the same distance
and slow down the video --

00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:39.128
again, by a factor of 10 billion --

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:43.545
do you know how long you'll have to sit
here to watch that movie?

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.157
(Laughter)

00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.690
A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.826
It'll be a very boring movie --

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.241
(Laughter)

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.637
of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.317
And what about some
still-life photography?

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:13.358
You can watch the ripples,
again, washing over the table,

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:16.040
the tomato and the wall in the back.

00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:18.854
It's like throwing a stone
in a pond of water.

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:26.323
I thought: this is how
nature paints a photo,

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:28.910
one femto frame at a time,

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:33.191
but of course our eye sees
an integral composite.

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:37.317
But if you look at this tomato
one more time,

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:40.086
you will notice, as the light
washes over the tomato,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.774
it continues to glow.

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:43.825
It doesn't become dark. Why is that?

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.147
Because the tomato is actually ripe,

00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:48.560
and the light is bouncing
around inside the tomato,

00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:52.004
and it comes out after several
trillionths of a second.

00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:57.313
So in the future, when this femto-camera
is in your camera phone,

00:04:57.337 --> 00:04:59.291
you might be able to go to a supermarket

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.370
and check if the fruit is ripe
without actually touching it.

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:04.080
(Laughter)

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.793
So how did my team at MIT
create this camera?

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.110
Now, as photographers, you know,

00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:15.095
if you take a short exposure photo,
you get very little light.

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:18.627
But we're going to go a billion times
faster than your shortest exposure,

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.580
so you're going to get hardly any light.

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:22.517
So what we do is we send that bullet --

00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.037
that packet of photons --
millions of times,

00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:28.144
and record again and again
with very clever synchronization,

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:30.107
and from the gigabytes of data,

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.351
we computationally weave together

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.274
to create those femto-videos I showed you.

00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:40.606
And we can take all that raw data
and treat it in very interesting ways.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.092
So, Superman can fly.

00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:45.374
Some other heroes can become invisible.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.652
But what about a new power
for a future superhero:

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:52.537
To see around corners.

00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:57.823
The idea is that we could
shine some light on the door,

00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:00.498
it's going to bounce, go inside the room,

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:02.928
some of that is going to reflect
back on the door,

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.435
and then back to the camera.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.456
And we could exploit
these multiple bounces of light.

00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:10.614
And it's not science fiction.
We have actually built it.

00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:12.704
On the left, you see our femto-camera.

00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:15.083
There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.612
and we're going to bounce
light off the door.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.502
So after our paper was published
in Nature Communications,

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.668
it was highlighted by Nature.com,

00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:26.168
and they created this animation.

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:27.476
(Music)

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.364
[A laser pulse is fired]

00:06:30.388 --> 00:06:33.260
(Music)

00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:36.151
Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire
those bullets of light,

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.551
and they're going to hit this wall,

00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:42.206
and because of the packet of the photons,

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.340
they will scatter in all the directions,

00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:46.705
and some of them will reach
our hidden mannequin,

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.111
which in turn will again
scatter that light,

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:54.706
and again in turn, the door will reflect
some of that scattered light.

00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:59.439
And a tiny fraction of the photons
will actually come back to the camera,

00:06:59.463 --> 00:07:00.614
but most interestingly,

00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:03.721
they will all arrive
at a slightly different time slot.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:09.019
(Music)

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:11.556
And because we have a camera
that can run so fast --

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.662
our femto-camera --
it has some unique abilities.

00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:17.504
It has very good time resolution,

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:20.423
and it can look at the world
at the speed of light.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:24.631
And this way, we know the distances,
of course to the door,

00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:26.432
but also to the hidden objects,

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:29.613
but we don't know which point
corresponds to which distance.

00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:33.682
(Music)

00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:37.136
By shining one laser,
we can record one raw photo,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.184
which, if you look on the screen,
doesn't really make any sense.

00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:42.328
But then we will take
a lot of such pictures,

00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:44.512
dozens of such pictures,
put them together,

00:07:44.536 --> 00:07:46.994
and try to analyze
the multiple bounces of light,

00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:50.469
and from that, can we see
the hidden object?

00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:52.627
Can we see it in full 3D?

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.302
So this is our reconstruction.

00:07:55.326 --> 00:08:00.456
(Music)

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.456
(Applause)

00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:09.520
Now, we have some ways to go

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:12.679
before we take this
outside the lab on the road,

00:08:12.703 --> 00:08:16.432
but in the future, we could create
cars that avoid collisions

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:17.937
with what's around the bend.

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:22.928
Or we can look for survivors
in hazardous conditions

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:26.176
by looking at light reflected
through open windows.

00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:32.735
Or we can build endoscopes that can see
deep inside the body around occluders,

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.459
and also for cardioscopes.

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:36.849
But of course,
because of tissue and blood,

00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:38.128
this is quite challenging,

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:40.087
so this is really a call for scientists

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.418
to start thinking about femto-photography

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:44.323
as really a new imaging modality

00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:47.867
to solve the next generation
of health-imaging problems.

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:52.199
Now, like Doc Edgerton,
a scientist himself,

00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:54.526
science became art --

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.212
an art of ultra-fast photography.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.291
And I realized

00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:02.756
that all the gigabytes of data
that we're collecting every time,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.201
are not just for scientific imaging.

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:10.764
But we can also do a new form
of computational photography,

00:09:10.788 --> 00:09:13.320
with time-lapse and color coding.

00:09:14.407 --> 00:09:15.876
And we look at those ripples.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.058
Remember:

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:22.555
The time between each of those ripples
is only a few trillionths of a second.

00:09:23.862 --> 00:09:26.069
But there's also something
funny going on here.

00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:28.889
When you look at the ripples
under the cap,

00:09:28.913 --> 00:09:31.096
the ripples are moving away from us.

00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:34.025
The ripples should be moving towards us.

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:35.421
What's going on here?

00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:42.235
It turns out, because we're recording
nearly at the speed of light,

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:44.148
we have strange effects,

00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:47.433
and Einstein would have loved
to see this picture.

00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:48.496
(Laughter)

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.567
The order at which events
take place in the world

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.917
appears in the camera
sometimes in reversed order.

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:59.501
So by applying the corresponding
space and time warp,

00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.892
we can correct for this distortion.

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:08.215
So whether it's for photography
around corners,

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:12.235
or creating the next generation
of health imaging,

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:15.151
or creating new visualizations,

00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:16.799
since our invention,

00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:21.948
we have open-sourced all the data
and details on our website,

00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:28.925
and our hope is that the DIY,
the creative and the research communities

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:34.454
will show us that we should stop obsessing
about the megapixels in cameras --

00:10:34.478 --> 00:10:35.757
(Laughter)

00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:40.169
and start focusing
on the next dimension in imaging.

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:42.177
It's about time.

00:10:42.597 --> 00:10:43.749
Thank you.

00:10:43.773 --> 00:10:50.643
(Applause)
