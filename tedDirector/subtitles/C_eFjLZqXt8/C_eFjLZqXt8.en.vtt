00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:14.328
Once upon a time

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:20.979
we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:24.674
This was called the Great Moderation,

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:28.080
the misguided belief by most economists,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.383
policymakers and central banks

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.714
that we have transformed into a new world

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:38.571
of never-ending growth and prosperity.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:43.314
This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.314
by low and controlled inflation,

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.553
by low unemployment,

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:52.459
and controlled and low financial volatility.

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:59.091
But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.570
the great crash, broke this illusion.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.594
A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:11.674
cascaded into five trillion dollars

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.558
of losses in world GDP

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:17.361
and almost $30 trillion losses

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.306
in the global stock market.

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:26.501
So the understanding of this Great Recession

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:31.862
was that this was completely surprising,

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.208
this came out of the blue,

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.125
this was like the wrath of the gods.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.916
There was no responsibility.

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.839
So, as a reflection of this,

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:43.448
we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:47.386
We had the goal to diagnose in real time

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.757
financial bubbles

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:55.614
and identify in advance their critical time.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.972
What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?

00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:03.598
We developed a theory called "dragon-kings."

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.804
Dragon-kings represent extreme events

00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:10.076
which are of a class of their own.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:12.919
They are special. They are outliers.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.359
They are generated by specific mechanisms

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.245
that may make them predictable,

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:22.143
perhaps controllable.

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:25.970
Consider the financial price time series,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.143
a given stock, your perfect stock,

00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:30.495
or a global index.

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.549
You have these up-and-downs.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.111
A very good measure of the risk of this financial market

00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:38.533
is the peaks-to-valleys that represent

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.829
a worst case scenario

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.502
when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:48.251
You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.606
of peak-to-valleys of different sizes,

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:53.157
which is represented in this graph.

00:02:53.157 --> 00:02:56.189
Now, interestingly, 99 percent

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.982
of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes

00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:03.442
can be represented by a universal power law

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:06.893
represented by this red line here.

00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:11.039
More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.942
which are above this red line,

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.701
occur 100 times more frequently, at least,

00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:20.854
than the extrapolation would predict them to occur

00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:24.791
based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.040
peak-to-valleys.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.640
They are due to trenchant dependancies

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.152
such that a loss is followed by a loss

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.115
which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:41.226
These kinds of dependencies

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:46.838
are largely missed by standard risk management tools,

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.767
which ignore them and see lizards

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:53.586
when they should see dragon-kings.

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:57.503
The root mechanism of a dragon-king

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.639
is a slow maturation towards instability,

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.261
which is the bubble,

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.891
and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:08.516
This is similar to the slow heating of water

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:11.419
in this test tube reaching the boiling point,

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.909
where the instability of the water occurs

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.246
and you have the phase transition to vapor.

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:20.923
And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --

00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:23.203
cannot be predicted by standard techniques --

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:27.379
is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.758
which is fundamentally endogenous.

00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:32.971
So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:36.155
has to be found in an inner instability of the system,

00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:42.191
and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.891
Now, some of you may have come to the mind

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.516
that is this not related to the black swan concept

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:51.451
you have heard about frequently?

00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.868
Remember, black swan is this rare bird

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:57.277
that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief

00:04:57.277 --> 00:04:59.751
that all swans should be white,

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:03.295
so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:04.804
unknowability, that the extreme events

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.635
are fundamentally unknowable.

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.360
Nothing can be further

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.998
from the dragon-king concept I propose,

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:15.716
which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:18.939
are actually knowable and predictable.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.444
So we can be empowered and take responsibility

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:24.663
and make predictions about them.

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:27.863
So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.

00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:29.489
(Laughter)

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:32.429
There are many early warning signals

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:34.308
that are predicted by this theory.

00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.675
Let me just focus on one of them:

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:39.827
the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.

00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:40.987
What does it mean?

00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:43.160
Imagine you have an investment

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.314
that returns the first year five percent,

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:49.469
the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.011
the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?

00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:55.409
This is a super-exponential growth.

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.346
A standard exponential growth corresponds

00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:01.090
to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.571
The point is that, many times during bubbles,

00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:08.168
there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:11.867
such that previous growths enhance,

00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:15.355
push forward, increase the next growth

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:17.857
through this kind of super-exponential growth,

00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:20.971
which is very trenchant, not sustainable.

00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:24.028
And the key idea is that the mathematical solution

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:27.666
of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:31.019
which means that there is a critical time

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.223
where the system will break, will change regime.

00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:37.499
It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.766
And the key idea is that the critical time,

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.295
the information about the critical time is contained

00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:47.779
in the early development of this super-exponential growth.

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:52.139
We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.698
to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.227
on the iron rocket.

00:06:58.227 --> 00:07:01.049
Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.346
that you hear a structure emit, sing to you

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:07.037
when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,

00:07:07.037 --> 00:07:09.477
there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,

00:07:09.477 --> 00:07:11.174
the more damage gives the more damage,

00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:13.649
so you can actually predict,

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.789
within, of course, a probability band,

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.702
when the rupture will occur.

00:07:17.702 --> 00:07:20.137
So this is now so successful that it is used

00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:24.502
in the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.

00:07:24.502 --> 00:07:27.309
Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:30.037
applies to biology and medicine,

00:07:30.037 --> 00:07:33.733
parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.357
From seven months of pregnancy, a mother

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:43.021
starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus

00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:47.125
that are the sign of these maturations

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.549
toward the instability, giving birth to the baby,

00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:52.920
the dragon-king.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.526
So if you measure the precursor signal,

00:07:55.526 --> 00:08:01.751
you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems

00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:03.222
in advance.

00:08:03.222 --> 00:08:06.982
Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,

00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:10.262
and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,

00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:13.835
you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:19.342
and this can help the patient to deal with this illness.

00:08:19.342 --> 00:08:21.527
We have applied this theory to many systems,

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:24.382
landslides, glacier collapse,

00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:27.949
even to the dynamics of prediction of success:

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:32.335
blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.

00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:35.471
But perhaps the most important application

00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.837
is for finance, and this theory

00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:41.276
illuminates, I believe, the deep reason

00:08:41.276 --> 00:08:43.972
for the financial crisis that we have gone through.

00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:48.020
This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.732
starting in 1980, with the global bubble

00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:53.819
crashing in 1987,

00:08:53.819 --> 00:08:56.188
followed by many other bubbles.

00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:58.900
The biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.825
in 2000, crashing in 2000,

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.873
the real estate bubbles in many countries,

00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:05.653
financial derivative bubbles everywhere,

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.942
stock market bubbles also everywhere,

00:09:07.942 --> 00:09:11.893
commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --

00:09:11.893 --> 00:09:14.606
bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:17.245
We had a global bubble.

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:21.486
This is a measure of global overvaluation

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:25.492
of all markets, expressing what I call

00:09:25.508 --> 00:09:28.677
an illusion of a perpetual money machine

00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:32.629
that suddenly broke in 2007.

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:36.863
The problem is that we see the same process,

00:09:36.863 --> 00:09:39.594
in particular through quantitative easing,

00:09:39.594 --> 00:09:42.778
of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:47.181
to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,

00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:49.469
in Japan.

00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:51.859
This has very important implications

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:55.937
to understand the failure of quantitative easing

00:09:55.937 --> 00:09:57.813
as well as austerity measures

00:09:57.813 --> 00:10:00.622
as long as we don't attack the core,

00:10:00.622 --> 00:10:05.813
the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.

00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:08.429
Now, these are big claims.

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:11.311
Why would you believe me?

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.191
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years

00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:17.383
we have come out of our ivory tower,

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.119
and started to publish ex ante --

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:23.447
and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" —

00:10:23.447 --> 00:10:25.585
before the crash confirmed

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:28.271
the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.

00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:31.993
These are a few of the major bubbles

00:10:31.993 --> 00:10:36.471
that we have lived through in recent history.

00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:39.311
Again, many interesting stories for each of them.

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.025
Let me tell you just one or two stories

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.071
that deal with massive bubbles.

00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.407
We all know the Chinese miracle.

00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.477
This is the expression of the stock market

00:10:49.477 --> 00:10:52.357
of a massive bubble, a factor of three,

00:10:52.357 --> 00:10:54.527
300 percent in just a few years.

00:10:54.527 --> 00:10:57.729
In September 2007,

00:10:57.729 --> 00:11:01.376
I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.825
management conference,

00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:07.880
and I showed to the conference a prediction

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.073
that by the end of 2007, this bubble

00:11:12.073 --> 00:11:14.042
would change regime.

00:11:14.042 --> 00:11:17.127
There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.

00:11:17.127 --> 00:11:22.369
Now, how do you believe the very smart,

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:27.799
very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.755
reacted to this prediction?

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.711
You know, they had made billions

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:34.546
just surfing this bubble until now.

00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:36.130
They told me, "Didier,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.167
yeah, the market might be overvalued,

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:41.063
but you forget something.

00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:43.415
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming

00:11:43.415 --> 00:11:45.679
in August 2008, and it's very clear that

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:48.871
the Chinese government is controlling the economy

00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:50.224
and doing what it takes

00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:54.671
to also avoid any wave and control the stock market."

00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:57.142
Three weeks after my presentation,

00:11:57.142 --> 00:11:59.268
the markets lost 20 percent

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:01.529
and went through a phase of volatility,

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:04.255
upheaval, and a total market loss of

00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:06.523
70 percent until the end of the year.

00:12:06.523 --> 00:12:09.399
So how can we be so collectively wrong

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:13.541
by misreading or ignoring the science

00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.372
of the fact that when an instability has developed,

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:18.823
and the system is ripe, any perturbation

00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:22.504
makes it essentially impossible to control?

00:12:22.504 --> 00:12:27.209
The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:31.965
In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:34.551
a smaller one, was unsustainable,

00:12:34.551 --> 00:12:38.183
so we published again a prediction, in advance,

00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:42.510
stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.191
will not continue on this track.

00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:48.343
Our critics, reading the prediction,

00:12:48.343 --> 00:12:52.256
said, "No, it's not possible.

00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:53.750
The Chinese government is there.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.432
They have learned their lesson. They will control.

00:12:56.432 --> 00:12:58.239
They want to benefit from the growth."

00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:01.895
Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:05.727
So the crisis did occur. The market corrected.

00:13:05.727 --> 00:13:08.063
The same critics then said, "Ah, yes,

00:13:08.063 --> 00:13:09.912
but you published your prediction.

00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:11.568
You influenced the market.

00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:14.701
It was not a prediction."

00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:18.058
Maybe I am very powerful then.

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:20.102
Now, this is interesting.

00:13:20.102 --> 00:13:23.039
It shows that it's essentially impossible until now

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.167
to develop a science of economics

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:28.310
because we are sentient beings who anticipate

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.373
and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.

00:13:32.373 --> 00:13:36.106
So we invented a new way of doing science.

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.818
We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.490
The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.658
We identify excesses, bubbles.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.962
We do our work. We write a report

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:53.234
in which we put our prediction of the critical time.

00:13:53.234 --> 00:13:55.809
We don't release the report. It's kept secret.

00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:58.674
But with modern encrypting techniques,

00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:02.696
we have a hash, we publish a public key,

00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:06.651
and six months later, we release the report,

00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:09.050
and there is authentication.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.818
And all this is done on an international archive

00:14:13.818 --> 00:14:18.018
so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.

00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:21.410
Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.668
17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:26.346
we identified that the U.S. stock market

00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:28.738
was on an unsustainable path

00:14:28.738 --> 00:14:32.540
and we released this on our website on the 21st of May

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.585
that there will be a change of regime.

00:14:34.585 --> 00:14:39.369
The next day, the market started to change regime, course.

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:40.860
This is not a crash.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.459
This is just the third or fourth act

00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:46.322
of a massive bubble in the making.

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:49.418
Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,

00:14:49.418 --> 00:14:50.443
we see the same thing.

00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:53.364
Wherever we look, it's observable:

00:14:53.364 --> 00:14:56.594
in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,

00:14:56.594 --> 00:15:00.498
showing these super-exponential trajectories

00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:03.129
characterizing an unsustainable path

00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:05.746
and announcing a phase transition.

00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:07.450
This diagram on the right

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.450
shows a very beautiful compilation of studies

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.160
suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.309
for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.

00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:21.931
So there are bubbles everywhere.

00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:23.895
From one side, this is exciting

00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:26.655
for me, as a professor who chases bubbles

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:31.413
and slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.

00:15:31.413 --> 00:15:34.464
But can we really slay the dragons?

00:15:34.464 --> 00:15:36.608
Very recently, with collaborators,

00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:39.311
we studied a dynamical system

00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:42.215
where you see the dragon-king as these big loops

00:15:42.215 --> 00:15:46.136
and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times

00:15:46.136 --> 00:15:51.071
that removed, when control is on, these dragons.

00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:54.005
"Gouverner, c'est prévoir."

00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:59.799
Governing is the art of planning and predicting.

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:02.552
But is it not the case that this is probably

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:06.452
one of the biggest gaps of mankind,

00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:09.712
which has the responsibility to steer

00:16:09.712 --> 00:16:12.415
our societies and our planet toward sustainability

00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:17.272
in the face of growing challenges and crises?

00:16:17.272 --> 00:16:21.767
But the dragon-king theory gives hope.

00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:25.335
We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.

00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:30.235
It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises

00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:33.794
so that we can be prepared, we can take measures,

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:36.549
we can take responsibility,

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:39.296
and so that never again will

00:16:39.296 --> 00:16:43.150
extremes and crises like the Great Recession

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.560
or the European crisis take us by surprise.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.035
Thank you.

00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:55.328
(Applause)
