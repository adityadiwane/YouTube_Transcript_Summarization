00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:15.081
So my name is Amy Webb,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.778
and a few years ago
I found myself at the end

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:20.414
of yet another fantastic relationship

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.526
that came burning down
in a spectacular fashion.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.778
And I thought, what's wrong with me?

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.860
I don't understand
why this keeps happening.

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:31.930
So I asked everybody in my life
what they thought.

00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:36.359
I turned to my grandmother,
who always had plenty of advice,

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:39.351
and she said, "Stop being so picky.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:40.729
You've got to date around.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:42.107
And most importantly,

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:45.730
true love will find you
when you least expect it."

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:48.031
Now as it turns out,

00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:50.588
I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:51.887
as you'll soon find.

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:57.077
I am constantly swimming
in numbers, formulas and charts.

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:59.477
I also have a very tight-knit family,

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.488
and I'm very, very close with my sister,

00:01:01.512 --> 00:01:04.964
and as a result, I wanted to have
the same type of family when I grew up.

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:06.861
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.088
I'm 30 years old,

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:11.815
I figure I'm probably going to have
to date somebody for about six months

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.657
before I'm ready to get monogamous

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.460
and before we can sort of cohabitate,

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:18.409
and we have to do that
for a while before we can get engaged.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.402
And if I want to start having children
by the time I'm 35,

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:24.603
that meant that I would have
had to have been on my way to marriage

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:25.789
five years ago.

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:27.583
So that wasn't going to work.

00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:31.330
If my strategy was to least-expect
my way into true love,

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:34.249
then the variable that I had
to deal with was serendipity.

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.017
In short, I was trying to figure out

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.929
what's the probability
of my finding Mr. Right?

00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.182
Well, at the time I was living
in the city of Philadelphia,

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.301
and it's a big city, and I figured,

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:48.292
in this entire place,
there are lots of possibilities.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.636
So again, I started doing some math.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.370
Population of Philadelphia:
it has 1.5 million people.

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:56.109
I figure about half of that are men,

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.703
so that takes the number down to 750,000.

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.912
I'm looking for a guy
between the ages of 30 and 36,

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.467
which was only four percent
of the population,

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.068
so now I'm dealing
with the possibility of 30,000 men.

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:09.093
I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:11.341
because I am and that was important to me.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.880
That's only 2.3 percent of the population.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:18.029
I figure I'm attracted to maybe
one out of 10 of those men,

00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:22.866
and there was no way I was going to deal
with somebody who was an avid golfer.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.926
So that basically meant
there were 35 men for me

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.154
that I could possibly date

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.846
in the entire city of Philadelphia.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.537
In the meantime,
my very large Jewish family

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.339
was already all married
and well on their way

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:40.250
to having lots and lots of children,

00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:42.751
and I felt like I was
under tremendous peer pressure

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.227
to get my life going already.

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.946
So I have two possible
strategies at this point

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.204
I'm sort of figuring out.

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:50.504
One, I can take my grandmother's advice

00:02:50.528 --> 00:02:52.760
and sort of least-expect my way

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:56.975
into maybe bumping into the one
out of 35 possible men

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.172
in the entire 1.5-million-person
city of Philadelphia,

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:03.785
or I could try online dating.

00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:06.342
Now, I like the idea of online dating,

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.343
because it's predicated on an algorithm,

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.492
and that's really just
a simple way of saying

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.808
I've got a problem,
I'm going to use some data,

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:15.213
run it through a system
and get to a solution.

00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:18.585
So online dating is the second
most popular way

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.243
that people now meet each other,

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.553
but as it turns out,
algorithms have been around

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.838
for thousands of years
in almost every culture.

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:29.335
In fact, in Judaism,
there were matchmakers a long time ago,

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.046
and though they didn't have
an explicit algorithm per se,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.085
they definitely were running
through formulas in their heads,

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.052
like, is the girl going to like the boy?

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:38.792
Are the families going to get along?

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.245
What's the rabbi going to say?

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.656
Are they going to start
having children right away?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.306
The matchmaker would sort
of think through all of this,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.028
put two people together,
and that would be the end of it.

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.794
So in my case, I thought,

00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:54.131
well, will data and an algorithm
lead me to my Prince Charming?

00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:55.995
So I decided to sign on.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.845
Now, there was one small catch.

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.476
As I'm signing on to the various
dating websites,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.771
as it happens, I was really, really busy.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:05.509
But that actually
wasn't the biggest problem.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:09.553
The biggest problem is that I hate
filling out questionnaires of any kind,

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:13.956
and I certainly don't like questionnaires
that are like Cosmo quizzes.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.454
So I just copied
and pasted from my résumé.

00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:21.911
(Laughter)

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:24.559
So in the descriptive part up top,

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:26.885
I said that I was
an award-winning journalist

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.515
and a future thinker.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.877
When I was asked about fun activities
and my ideal date,

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:36.087
I said monetization
and fluency in Japanese.

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:37.804
I talked a lot about JavaScript.

00:04:37.828 --> 00:04:39.051
(Laughter)

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:45.202
So obviously this was not the best way
to put my most sexy foot forward.

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:50.227
But the real failure was that
there were plenty of men for me to date.

00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.688
These algorithms had a sea full of men

00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:55.394
that wanted to take me out
on lots of dates --

00:04:55.418 --> 00:04:58.346
what turned out to be truly awful dates.

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:01.481
There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.128
The algorithm matched us up
because we share a love of gadgets,

00:05:05.152 --> 00:05:09.197
we share a love of math
and data and '80s music,

00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.170
and so I agreed to go out with him.

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:13.827
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:15.921
to one of Philadelphia's
white-table-cloth,

00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:17.628
extremely expensive restaurants.

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:19.691
And we went in, and right off the bat,

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.951
our conversation really
wasn't taking flight,

00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:24.780
but he was ordering a lot of food.

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:27.233
In fact, he didn't even bother
looking at the menu.

00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:31.132
He was ordering multiple appetizers,
multiple entrées, for me as well,

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:34.014
and suddenly there are piles
and piles of food on our table,

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:36.092
also lots and lots of bottles of wine.

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:38.273
So we're nearing the end
of our conversation

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.194
and the end of dinner, and I've decided

00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:43.328
Steve the I.T. guy and I are really
just not meant for each other,

00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:44.915
but we'll part ways as friends,

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.364
when he gets up to go to the bathroom,

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:50.515
and in the meantime,
the bill comes to our table.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.564
And listen, I'm a modern woman.

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:55.929
I am totally down with splitting the bill.

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:59.081
But then Steve the I.T. guy
didn't come back.

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:00.191
(Gasping)

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:03.596
And that was my entire month's rent.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.954
(Audience gasps)

00:06:04.978 --> 00:06:08.227
So needless to say,
I was not having a good night.

00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:11.928
So I run home, I call
my mother, I call my sister,

00:06:11.952 --> 00:06:16.126
and as I do, at the end of each one
of these terrible, terrible dates,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.822
I regale them with the details.

00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:20.378
And they say to me,

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:21.997
"Stop complaining."

00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:23.956
(Laughter)

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.773
"You're just being too picky."

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:29.486
So I said, fine, from here on out
I'm only going on dates

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.213
where I know there's Wi-Fi,
and I'm bringing my laptop.

00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:33.872
I'm going to shove it into my bag,

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.729
I'm going to have this email template,

00:06:35.753 --> 00:06:38.182
and I'm going to fill it out
and collect information

00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:40.622
on all these different
data points during the date

00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:42.504
to prove to everybody that empirically,

00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:44.105
these dates really are terrible.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.152
(Laughter)

00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:49.270
So I started tracking things like
really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;

00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:51.449
bad vocabulary;

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.504
the number of times a man
forced me to high-five him.

00:06:54.528 --> 00:06:56.678
(Laughter)

00:06:56.702 --> 00:07:01.068
So I started to crunch some numbers,

00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:03.743
and that allowed me
to make some correlations.

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.367
So as it turns out,

00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:11.465
for some reason, men who drink Scotch
reference kinky sex immediately.

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:13.602
(Laughter)

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:17.866
Well, it turns out
that these probably weren't bad guys.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.776
There were just bad for me.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.451
And as it happens, the algorithms
that were setting us up,

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.856
they weren't bad either.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.149
These algorithms were doing exactly
what they were designed to do,

00:07:28.173 --> 00:07:30.764
which was to take
our user-generated information,

00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:32.268
in my case, my résumé,

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:35.295
and match it up
with other people's information.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.986
See, the real problem here is that,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.954
while the algorithms work just fine,

00:07:38.978 --> 00:07:40.209
you and I don't,

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:42.346
when confronted with blank windows

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.871
where we're supposed to input
our information online.

00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:46.546
Very few of us have the ability

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.022
to be totally and brutally
honest with ourselves.

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:52.618
The other problem
is that these websites are asking us

00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:55.496
questions like, are you
a dog person or a cat person?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.481
Do you like horror films or romance films?

00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:00.235
I'm not looking for a pen pal.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:02.145
I'm looking for a husband. Right?

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.560
So there's a certain amount
of superficiality in that data.

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:08.130
So I said fine, I've got a new plan.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.535
I'm going to keep using
these online dating sites,

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:13.020
but I'm going to treat them as databases,

00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.709
and rather than waiting
for an algorithm to set me up,

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:18.987
I think I'm going to try
reverse-engineering this entire system.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.401
So knowing that there was superficial data

00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:24.949
that was being used
to match me up with other people,

00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:27.400
I decided instead to ask my own questions.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.154
What was every single possible thing

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:31.815
that I could think of
that I was looking for in a mate?

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.742
So I started writing

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:36.458
and writing and writing,

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:41.277
and at the end, I had amassed
72 different data points.

00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:43.555
I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:45.152
so I was looking for somebody

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.906
who had the same background
and thoughts on our culture,

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.270
but wasn't going to force me to go to shul
every Friday and Saturday.

00:08:51.743 --> 00:08:53.363
I wanted somebody who worked hard,

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:55.435
because work for me
is extremely important,

00:08:55.459 --> 00:08:57.011
but not too hard.

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.543
For me, the hobbies that I have

00:08:58.567 --> 00:09:01.408
are really just new work projects
that I've launched.

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:04.492
I also wanted somebody
who not only wanted two children,

00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:07.678
but was going to have the same
attitude toward parenting that I do,

00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.765
so somebody who was going
to be totally okay

00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:13.143
with forcing our child to start
taking piano lessons at age three,

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:17.912
and also maybe computer science classes
if we could wrangle it.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:20.619
So things like that,
but I also wanted somebody

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.560
who would go to far-flung,
exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.

00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:27.686
I also wanted somebody who would weigh
20 pounds more than me at all times,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.092
regardless of what I weighed.

00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:31.203
(Laughter)

00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:34.115
So I now have
these 72 different data points,

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:36.350
which, to be fair, is a lot.

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:39.501
So what I did was, I went through
and I prioritized that list.

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:43.318
I broke it into a top tier
and a second tier of points,

00:09:43.342 --> 00:09:46.543
and I ranked everything starting at 100

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.793
and going all the way down to 91,

00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:52.223
and listing things like I was looking
for somebody who was really smart,

00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:54.010
who would challenge and stimulate me,

00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:57.756
and balancing that with a second tier
and a second set of points.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.011
These things were also important to me
but not necessarily deal-breakers.

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.582
(Laughter)

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.207
So once I had all this done,
I then built a scoring system,

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:11.712
because what I wanted to do
was to sort of mathematically calculate

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.218
whether or not I thought
the guy that I found online

00:10:14.242 --> 00:10:15.633
would be a match with me.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:18.164
I figured there would be
a minimum of 700 points

00:10:18.188 --> 00:10:21.788
before I would agree to email somebody
or respond to an email message.

00:10:21.812 --> 00:10:24.003
For 900 points,
I'd agree to go out on a date,

00:10:24.027 --> 00:10:26.684
and I wouldn't even consider
any kind of relationship

00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:29.747
before somebody had crossed
the 1,500 point threshold.

00:10:30.683 --> 00:10:33.531
Well, as it turns out,
this worked pretty well.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.469
So I go back online now.

00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:38.095
I found Jewishdoc57

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:41.032
who's incredibly good-looking,
incredibly well-spoken,

00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:42.750
he had hiked Mt. Fuji,

00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:44.680
he had walked along the Great Wall.

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:45.855
He likes to travel

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:48.005
as long as it doesn't involve
a cruise ship.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.542
And I thought,

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.717
I've done it!

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:52.276
I've cracked the code.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.363
I have just found
the Jewish Prince Charming

00:10:56.387 --> 00:10:57.959
of my family's dreams.

00:10:58.736 --> 00:11:00.105
There was only one problem:

00:11:01.685 --> 00:11:02.986
He didn't like me back.

00:11:03.887 --> 00:11:06.949
And I guess the one variable
that I haven't considered

00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:08.383
is the competition.

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:11.743
Who are all of the other women
on these dating sites?

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:16.028
I found SmileyGirl1978.

00:11:16.584 --> 00:11:19.308
She said she was a "Fun girl
who is Happy and Outgoing."

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:20.938
She listed her job as "teacher."

00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:23.356
She said she is
"silly, nice and friendly."

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.414
She likes to make people laugh "alot."

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:27.376
At this moment I knew,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.485
clicking profile after profile
that looked like this,

00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:33.003
that I needed to do some market research.

00:11:33.483 --> 00:11:35.754
So I created 10 fake male profiles.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:38.698
Now, before I lose all of you --

00:11:38.722 --> 00:11:41.930
(Laughter) --

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:46.176
understand that I did this
strictly to gather data

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.924
about everybody else in the system.

00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:52.235
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style
relationships with anybody.

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.132
I really was just scraping their data.

00:11:54.156 --> 00:11:56.100
But I didn't want everybody's data.

00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:59.547
I only wanted data on the women
who were going to be attracted

00:11:59.571 --> 00:12:02.269
to the type of man that I really,
really wanted to marry.

00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:06.376
When I released these men into the wild,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.678
I did follow some rules.

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:09.818
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.

00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:12.795
I just waited to see
who these profiles were going to attract,

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:16.110
and mainly what I was looking at
was two different data sets.

00:12:16.134 --> 00:12:17.896
So I was looking at qualitative data,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.597
so what was the humor, the tone,

00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:21.241
the voice, the communication style

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:23.009
that these women shared in common?

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.319
And also quantitative data,

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.630
so what was the average length
of their profile,

00:12:26.654 --> 00:12:29.023
how much time was spent between messages?

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:32.471
What I was trying to get at here was
that I figured, in person,

00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:35.946
I would be just as competitive
as a SmileyGirl1978.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.367
I wanted to figure out how to maximize
my own profile online.

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:42.513
Well, one month later,

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:46.266
I had a lot of data,
and I was able to do another analysis.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.146
And as it turns out,
content matters a lot.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.121
So smart people tend to write a lot --

00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:55.470
3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words
about themselves,

00:12:55.494 --> 00:12:57.797
which may all be very, very interesting.

00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.701
The challenge here, though,
is that the popular men and women

00:13:00.725 --> 00:13:03.922
are sticking to 97 words on average

00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:05.866
that are written very, very well,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.534
even though it may not seem
like it all the time.

00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:10.897
The other hallmark
of the people who do this well

00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:13.024
is that they're using
non-specific language.

00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:14.350
So in my case,

00:13:14.374 --> 00:13:17.960
"The English Patient"
is my most favorite movie ever,

00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:21.133
but it doesn't work
to use that in a profile,

00:13:21.157 --> 00:13:23.111
because that's a superficial data point,

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.327
and somebody may disagree

00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:26.094
and decide they don't want to go out

00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:29.082
because they didn't like
sitting through the three-hour movie.

00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.086
Also, optimistic language matters a lot.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.322
So this is a word cloud

00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:34.782
highlighting the most popular
words that were used

00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:36.114
by the most popular women,

00:13:36.138 --> 00:13:38.511
words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."

00:13:38.828 --> 00:13:42.368
And what I realized was not
that I had to dumb down my own profile.

00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:43.900
Remember, I'm somebody who said

00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:46.943
that I speak fluent Japanese
and I know JavaScript

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:48.688
and I was okay with that.

00:13:48.712 --> 00:13:51.470
The difference is that it's about being
more approachable

00:13:51.494 --> 00:13:55.021
and helping people understand
the best way to reach out to you.

00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:58.065
And as it turns out, timing
is also really, really important.

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:01.337
Just because you have access
to somebody's mobile phone number

00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:03.093
or their instant message account

00:14:03.117 --> 00:14:06.032
and it's 2 o'clock in the morning
and you happen to be awake,

00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:09.371
doesn't mean that that's a good time
to communicate with those people.

00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:11.338
The popular women on these online sites

00:14:11.362 --> 00:14:14.829
spend an average of 23 hours
in between each communication.

00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:19.547
And that's what we would normally do
in the usual process of courtship.

00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.757
And finally --

00:14:21.592 --> 00:14:23.147
there were the photos.

00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:26.196
All of the women who were popular
showed some skin.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.422
They all looked really great,

00:14:28.446 --> 00:14:31.324
which turned out to be in sharp contrast

00:14:31.348 --> 00:14:32.848
to what I had uploaded.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.610
(Laughter)

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:36.340
Once I had all of this information,

00:14:36.364 --> 00:14:38.477
I was able to create a super profile,

00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:40.502
so it was still me,

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:43.494
but it was me optimized now
for this ecosystem.

00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:48.391
And as it turns out,
I did a really good job.

00:14:49.134 --> 00:14:52.166
I was the most popular person online.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.685
(Laughter)

00:14:54.709 --> 00:14:58.899
(Applause)

00:14:58.923 --> 00:15:02.386
And as it turns out, lots and lots
of men wanted to date me.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.211
So I call my mom, I call my sister,
I call my grandmother.

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:07.364
I'm telling them about this fabulous news,

00:15:07.388 --> 00:15:10.617
and they say, "This is wonderful!
How soon are you going out?"

00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:13.323
I said, "Actually, I'm not going
to go out with anybody."

00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:15.221
Because remember, in my scoring system,

00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:17.741
they have to reach a minimum
threshold of 700 points,

00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:19.304
and none of them have done that.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.407
They said, "What?
You're still being too damn picky."

00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.965
Well, not too long after that,
I found this guy, Thevenin,

00:15:25.989 --> 00:15:28.980
and he said that he was culturally Jewish,

00:15:29.004 --> 00:15:32.520
he said that his job
was an arctic baby seal hunter,

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:34.320
which I thought was very clever.

00:15:34.344 --> 00:15:37.197
He talked in detail about travel.

00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:39.888
He made a lot of really
interesting cultural references.

00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:42.654
He looked and talked exactly
like what I wanted,

00:15:42.678 --> 00:15:45.812
and immediately, he scored 850 points.

00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:47.500
It was enough for a date.

00:15:47.524 --> 00:15:49.616
Three weeks later, we met up in person

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.120
for what turned out to be
a 14-hour-long conversation

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:55.191
that went from coffee shop to restaurant

00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:57.372
to another coffee shop
to another restaurant,

00:15:57.396 --> 00:15:59.920
and when he dropped me back off
at my house that night

00:15:59.944 --> 00:16:01.095
I re-scored him --

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:02.285
[1,050 points!]

00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:03.582
Thought, you know what,

00:16:03.606 --> 00:16:06.166
this entire time,
I haven't been picky enough.

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:08.555
Well, a year and a half after that,

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:11.102
we were non-cruise ship traveling

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:13.187
through Petra, Jordan,

00:16:13.211 --> 00:16:15.696
when he got down on his knee and proposed.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.159
A year after that, we were married,

00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:21.062
and about a year and a half after that,

00:16:21.086 --> 00:16:23.306
our daughter, Petra, was born.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.742
Audience: Oh!

00:16:25.099 --> 00:16:27.640
(Applause)

00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:28.996
[What it means...]

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:33.066
Obviously, I'm having
a fabulous life, so --

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.626
(Laughter)

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.122
The question is, what does
all of this mean for you?

00:16:37.146 --> 00:16:40.970
Well, as it turns out,
there is an algorithm for love.

00:16:40.994 --> 00:16:44.295
It's just not the ones
that we're being presented with online.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.976
In fact, it's something
that you write yourself.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.334
So whether you're looking
for a husband or a wife

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:51.215
or you're trying to find your passion

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:53.001
or you're trying to start a business,

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.879
all you have to really do
is figure out your own framework

00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:57.663
and play by your own rules,

00:16:57.687 --> 00:16:59.948
and feel free to be as picky as you want.

00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:01.763
Well, on my wedding day,

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:04.026
I had a conversation again
with my grandmother,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.466
and she said, "All right,
maybe I was wrong.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.905
It looks like you did come up
with a really, really great system.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.659
Now, your matzah balls ...

00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:14.953
