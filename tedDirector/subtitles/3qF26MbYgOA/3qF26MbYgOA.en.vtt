00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
(Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then as a worried member of the human race.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And let me just run through a few slides.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
than what actually happened last Monday.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's another project for NASA.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This artist's impression turned into reality

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That looks like a coastline.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we go beyond our solar system,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And we can see places where stars are forming,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
leaving remnants like that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And to the cosmologist,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This picture shows a patch of sky

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to cover the full moon in the sky.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which looks so small and faint because its light

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the building blocks of planets and of life.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
turn into our complex cosmos?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I'm going to show you a movie simulation

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
16 powers of 10 faster than real time,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And we'll end up after 13 billion years

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
with something looking rather like our own universe.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And we compare simulated universes like that --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
with what we actually see in the sky.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the world of the quantum -- and on the right

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We know our universes are united though --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
links between left and right.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The everyday world is determined by atoms,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
how they stick together to make molecules.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is to link together cosmos and micro-world

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
at the top of that picture. (Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And until we have that synthesis,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
quantum effects could shake everything.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which we don't yet have.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
One idea, incidentally --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is that our Big Bang was not the only one.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You can imagine ants on one of them

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
not being aware of another population of ants on the other.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but we're not aware of it because that millimeter

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and we're imprisoned in our three.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
than what we've normally called our universe --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Bottom right depicts our universe,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which on the horizon is not beyond that,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
one galaxy to many galaxies,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
an immense variety of properties.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Well, let's go back to this picture.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
There's one challenge symbolized at the top,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but we want to understand the very complex.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And the most complex things are ourselves,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
midway between atoms and stars.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to have layer upon layer of complex structure.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
as there are atoms in each of us.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Well, most of you anyway.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
greater than that of the very small on the left

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and the very large on the right.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And it's this science,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
but also transforming our world faster than ever.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I now move on to the second part of my talk,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and I would add that it's available in paperback.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And in America it was called "Our Final Hour"

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
because Americans like instant gratification.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
(Laughter)

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But my theme is that in this century,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
not only has science changed the world faster than ever,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
but in new and different ways.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
perhaps even implants into our brains,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
may change human beings themselves. And human beings,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It may change this century.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It's new in our history.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in that they offer marvelous prospects,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But they will have a dark side.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
just one fanatic,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to trigger some kind on disaster.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
error rather than terror.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
when the downside could be of global consequence.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I don't go along with all that,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
as well as dangerous ones.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We have to accept that there will be hazards.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to alert the world to the dangers.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the icon of poster and t-shirt,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
He was premature. But he was a moral compass --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And perhaps the greatest living person

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And I think to harness science optimally,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We need not just campaigning physicists,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
but we need biologists, computer experts

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and environmentalists as well.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have a special obligation because they have more freedom

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
than those in government service,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
or company employees subject to commercial pressure.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
are now part of common culture --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
(Laughter)

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And it'll be another six billion before that happens,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
experiencing the sun's demise,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
but any life and intelligence that exists then

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
in our Earth and beyond.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
say from January when it was made to December,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
a tiny fraction of the year.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
our century is very, very special,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
As I should have shown this earlier,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
When Einstein died in 1955,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
by Herblock in the Washington Post.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
contrasted with the sterile moonscape

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
on which the astronauts left their footprints.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
What would they have seen?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Over nearly all that immense time,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
The only abrupt worldwide change

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
The continental landmasses drifted around.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Ice cover waxed and waned.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
This signaled the start of agriculture.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Then other things happened even more abruptly.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Within just 50 years --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and ominously fast.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves --

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the total output from all TV and cell phones

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and radar transmissions. And something else happened.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
escaped into orbit around the Earth.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
A race of advanced extraterrestrials

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
watching our solar system from afar

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
less than halfway through the Earth's life?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
These human-induced alterations

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
If they continued their vigil,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
what might these hypothetical aliens witness

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
in the next hundred years?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Or will the biosphere stabilize?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
The science done by the young Einstein will continue

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
humane, global and farseeing.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
far beyond the Earth as depicted here.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(Applause)
