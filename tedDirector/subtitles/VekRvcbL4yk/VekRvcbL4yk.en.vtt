00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.752
I will always remember

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:19.999
the first time I met the girl
in the blue uniform.

00:00:21.577 --> 00:00:24.165
I was eight at the time,

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.522
living in the village with my grandmother,

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:30.355
who was raising me and other children.

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:36.212
Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.259
and we just didn't have enough to eat.

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.386
We were hungry.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:47.077
And that's when the girl
in the blue uniform

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:50.657
came to my village with the United Nations

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:52.459
to feed the children.

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:56.363
As she handed me my porridge,

00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:59.648
I asked her why she was there,

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:03.362
and without hesitation, she said,

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:10.044
"As Africans, we must uplift
all the people of Africa."

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.737
I had absolutely no idea what she meant.

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.832
(Laughter)

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.443
But her words stuck with me.

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:21.975
Two years later,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.450
famine hit my country for the second time.

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:30.975
My grandmother had no choice
but to send me to the city

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.783
to live with an aunt
I had never met before.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.007
So at the age of 10,

00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:41.053
I found myself in school
for the very first time.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.459
And there, at the city school,

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:49.514
I would experience
what it was to be unequal.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.777
You see, in the village,

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.070
we were all equal.

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:58.261
But in the eyes and the minds
of the other kids,

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.220
I was not their equal.

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.498
I couldn't speak English,

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:07.831
and I was way behind
in terms of reading and writing.

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:13.752
But this feeling of inequality
would get even more complex.

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.761
Every school holiday

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:19.920
spent back in the village
with my grandmother

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:22.412
made me consciously aware

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:25.975
of the inequalities
this incredible opportunity

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.641
had created within my own family.

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:34.324
Suddenly, I had much more
than the rest of my village.

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:39.546
And in their eyes,
I was no longer their equal.

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:42.443
I felt guilty.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.037
But I thought about the girl
in the blue uniform,

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.324
and I remember thinking,

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:53.157
"That's who I want to be --

00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.250
someone like her,

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:58.704
someone who uplifts other people."

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:04.975
This childhood experience
led me to the United Nations,

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.626
and to my current role with UN Women,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.793
where we are addressing
one of the greatest inequalities

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.762
that affects more than half
of the world's population --

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:16.967
women and girls.

00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:20.482
Today, I want to share with you

00:03:20.506 --> 00:03:27.284
a simple idea that seeks to uplift
all of us together.

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:30.871
Eight months ago,

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:35.140
under the visionary leadership
of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.220
head of UN Women,

00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:40.245
we launched a groundbreaking initiative

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.093
called HeForShe,

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:45.506
inviting men and boys
from around the world

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.848
to stand in solidarity
with each other and with women,

00:03:49.872 --> 00:03:53.411
to create a shared vision
for gender equality.

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:58.975
This is an invitation
for those who believe in equality

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.260
for women and men,

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.847
and those who don't yet know
that they believe.

00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:09.975
The initiative is based on a simple idea:

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:14.380
that what we share is much more powerful

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:15.840
than what divides us.

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:19.301
We all feel the same things.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.316
We all want the same things,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.602
even when those things
sometimes remain unspoken.

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:31.078
HeForShe is about uplifting all of us,

00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:32.856
women and men together.

00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:37.736
It's moving us towards
an inflection point for gender equality.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.150
Imagine a blank page

00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:44.285
with one horizontal line
splitting it in half.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.403
Now imagine that women
are represented here,

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:52.125
and men are represented here.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:55.275
In our current population,

00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.687
HeForShe is about moving
the 3.2 billion men,

00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.800
one man at a time,

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.625
across that line,

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:09.975
so that ultimately,
men can stand alongside women

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.840
and be on the right side of history,

00:05:12.864 --> 00:05:18.284
making gender equality a reality
in the 21st century.

00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:24.130
However, engaging men in the movement
would prove quite controversial.

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.848
Why invite men? They are the problem.

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:29.030
(Laughter)

00:05:29.054 --> 00:05:32.022
In fact, men don't care, we were told.

00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:37.077
But something incredible happened
when we launched HeForShe.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.467
In just three days, more than 100,000 men

00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:48.848
had signed up and committed
to be agents of change for equality.

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:56.427
Within that first week, at least one man
in every single country in the world

00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:59.244
stood up to be counted,

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.617
and within that same week,

00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:08.054
HeForShe created more than
1.2 billion conversations on social media.

00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:13.609
And that's when the emails
started pouring in,

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:17.681
sometimes as many as a thousand a day.

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:22.490
We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:25.181
who, after hearing about HeForShe,

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:26.863
created a "husband school."

00:06:27.443 --> 00:06:29.736
(Laughter)

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.712
He literally went around his village,

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:36.998
hand-picking all of the men
that were abusive to their partners,

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:41.387
and committed to turn them
into better husbands and fathers.

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:48.688
In Pune, India, a youth advocate
organized an innovative bicycle rally,

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:52.348
mobilizing 700 cyclists

00:06:52.372 --> 00:06:56.665
to share the HeForShe messages
within their own community.

00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:00.490
In another impact story,

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:02.919
a man sent a very personal note

00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:05.943
of something that had happened
in his own community.

00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:09.395
He wrote,

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.307
"Dear Madam,

00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.967
I have lived all of my life

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:18.038
next door to a man
who continuously beats up his wife.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.045
Two weeks ago,

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.776
I was listening to my radio,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.212
and your voice came on,

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:30.756
and you spoke about something
called the HeForShe,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.660
and the need for men to play their role.

00:07:35.023 --> 00:07:40.705
Within a few hours, I heard
the woman cry again next door,

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.149
but for the first time,

00:07:43.173 --> 00:07:45.166
I didn't just sit there.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.975
I felt compelled to do something,

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.555
so I went over
and I confronted the husband.

00:07:53.694 --> 00:07:57.060
Madam, it has been two weeks,

00:07:57.084 --> 00:07:59.400
and the woman has not cried since.

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.935
Thank you for giving me a voice."

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:08.142
(Applause)

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:11.975
Personal impact stories such as these

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:16.340
show that we are tapping
into something within men,

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:19.975
but getting to a world
where women and men are equal

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.893
is not just a matter
of bringing men to the cause.

00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:31.316
We want concrete, systematic,
structural change that can equalize

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.800
the political, economic
and social realities for women and men.

00:08:37.514 --> 00:08:40.569
We are asking men
to make concrete actions,

00:08:40.593 --> 00:08:43.713
calling them to intervene
at a personal level,

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:45.656
to change their behavior.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:51.165
We are calling upon governments,
businesses, universities,

00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:53.189
to change their policies.

00:08:54.237 --> 00:08:58.419
We want male leaders to become role models

00:08:58.443 --> 00:09:01.919
and change agents
within their own institutions.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.697
Already, a number of prominent men
and leaders have stepped up

00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.165
and made some concrete
HeForShe commitments.

00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:14.775
In a few early success stories,

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:18.339
a leading French
hospitality company, Accor,

00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:22.039
has committed to eliminate the pay gap

00:09:22.063 --> 00:09:26.864
for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:31.007
(Applause)

00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:33.467
The government of Sweden,

00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:36.150
under its current feminist government,

00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:41.333
has committed to close
both the employment and the pay gap

00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:45.626
for all of its citizens
within the current electoral term.

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:50.101
In Japan, the University of Nagoya

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:53.380
is building, as part of
their HeForShe commitments,

00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:58.721
what will become one of Japan's
leading gender-research centers.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:03.172
Now, eight months later,

00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:05.133
a movement is building.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.975
We are seeing men sign up
from every single walk of life,

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:14.349
and from every single corner in the world,

00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:18.555
from the United Nations' own
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon

00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:24.197
to the Secretary-Generals of NATO
and the EU Council,

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:26.798
from the prime minister of Bhutan

00:10:26.822 --> 00:10:28.924
to the president of Sierra Leone.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:34.186
In Europe alone,
all the male EU Commissioners

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.306
and the members of Parliament
of the Swedish and Iceland governments

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.741
have signed up to be HeForShe.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:47.257
In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland
has joined the movement.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:53.213
The rallying call of our passionate
goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,

00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:57.166
has garnered more than
five billion media impressions,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:02.191
mobilizing hundreds and thousands
of students around the world

00:11:02.215 --> 00:11:06.603
to create more than a hundred
HeForShe student associations.

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:13.317
Now this is the beginning
of the vision that HeForShe has

00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:15.022
for the world that we want to see.

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:18.698
Einstein once said,

00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:24.499
"A human being is part of the whole ...

00:11:24.523 --> 00:11:27.238
but he experiences himself,

00:11:27.262 --> 00:11:29.333
his thoughts and feelings,

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:31.836
as something separate from the rest ...

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.002
This delusion
is a kind of prison for us ...

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:41.816
Our task must be
to free ourselves from this prison

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.236
by widening our circle of compassion."

00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:50.451
If women and men
are part of a greater whole,

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:52.975
as Einstein suggests,

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:58.252
it is my hope that HeForShe
can help free us to realize

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:02.927
that it is not our gender that defines us,

00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.967
but ultimately, our shared humanity.

00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:11.508
HeForShe is tapping
into women's and men's dreams,

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:14.546
the dreams that we have for ourselves,

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.475
and the dreams that we have
for our families, our children,

00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:22.141
friends, communities.

00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:25.951
So that's what it is about.

00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:33.323
HeForShe is about uplifting
all of us together.

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.245
Thank you.

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:37.928
(Applause)
