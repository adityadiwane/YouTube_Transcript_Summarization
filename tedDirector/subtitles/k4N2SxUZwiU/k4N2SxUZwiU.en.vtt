00:00:13.023 --> 00:00:14.666
As a boy in Lima,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.801
my grandfather told me a legend

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:19.079
of the Spanish conquest of Peru.

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.546
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
had been captured and killed.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.553
Pizarro and his conquistadors
had grown rich,

00:00:26.577 --> 00:00:29.763
and tales of their conquest
and glory had reached Spain

00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:35.162
and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
hungry for gold and glory.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.953
They would go into towns and ask the Inca,

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.752
"Where's another civilization
we can conquer? Where's more gold?"

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.155
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:48.257
"Go to the Amazon.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.413
You'll find all the gold you want there.

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:56.151
In fact, there is a city called Paititi --
El Dorado in Spanish --

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:58.802
made entirely of gold."

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:01.199
The Spanish set off into the jungle,

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.785
but the few that return
come back with stories,

00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:09.711
stories of powerful shamans,

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.639
of warriors with poisoned arrows,

00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:16.441
of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:21.217
spiders that ate birds,
snakes that swallowed men whole

00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.525
and a river that boiled.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:27.779
All this became a childhood memory.

00:01:27.803 --> 00:01:28.962
And years passed.

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:31.461
I'm working on my PhD at SMU,

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:35.389
trying to understand
Peru's geothermal energy potential,

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:37.459
when I remember this legend,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.332
and I began asking that question.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:42.863
Could the boiling river exist?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.339
I asked colleagues from universities,

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:47.520
the government,

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:49.037
oil, gas and mining companies,

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:51.967
and the answer was a unanimous no.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.459
And this makes sense.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.698
You see, boiling rivers
do exist in the world,

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.181
but they're generally
associated with volcanoes.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.796
You need a powerful heat source

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.186
to produce such a large
geothermal manifestation.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.414
And as you can see from the red dots
here, which are volcanoes,

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.256
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.098
nor in most of Peru.

00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:20.390
So it follows: We should not expect
to see a boiling river.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.748
Telling this same story
at a family dinner,

00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:28.242
my aunt tells me,

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:32.248
"But no, Andrés, I've been there.
I've swum in that river."

00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:36.535
(Laughter)

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.306
Then my uncle jumps in.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.060
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:45.067
You see, you can only swim in it
after a very heavy rain,

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:48.337
and it's protected by a powerful shaman.

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.678
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:53.062
(Laughter)

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:54.237
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:56.475
You know, despite all
my scientific skepticism,

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.931
I found myself hiking into the jungle,
guided by my aunt,

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:04.852
over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center,

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:08.494
and well, honestly,
mentally preparing myself

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:12.894
to behold the legendary
"warm stream of the Amazon."

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:16.292
But then ...

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:17.638
I heard something,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:20.704
a low surge

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:25.042
that got louder and louder

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:27.260
as we came closer.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.228
It sounded like ocean waves
constantly crashing,

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:36.937
and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,
coming up through the trees.

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.260
And then, I saw this.

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.260
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:47.561
and the average temperatures in the river

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:49.572
were 86 degrees C.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.807
This is not quite
the 100-degree C boiling

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.708
but definitely close enough.

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:01.388
The river flowed hot and fast.

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:05.829
I followed it upriver and was led by,
actually, the shaman's apprentice

00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:07.637
to the most sacred site on the river.

00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.067
And this is what's bizarre --

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:11.073
It starts off as a cold stream.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:13.739
And here, at this site,

00:04:13.763 --> 00:04:15.930
is the home of the Yacumama,

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:19.297
mother of the waters,
a giant serpent spirit

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.394
who births hot and cold water.

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:26.427
And here we find a hot spring,

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:31.809
mixing with cold stream water
underneath her protective motherly jaws

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:35.078
and thus bringing their legends to life.

00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:38.261
The next morning, I woke up and --

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:40.504
(Laughter)

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:42.559
I asked for tea.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.823
I was handed a mug, a tea bag

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.175
and, well, pointed towards the river.

00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:52.584
To my surprise, the water was clean
and had a pleasant taste,

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:55.602
which is a little weird
for geothermal systems.

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:57.989
What was amazing

00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.997
is that the locals had always
known about this place,

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.725
and that I was by no means
the first outsider to see it.

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.638
It was just part of their everyday life.

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.809
They drink its water.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:14.388
They take in its vapor.

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.103
They cook with it,

00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:17.637
clean with it,

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.459
even make their medicines with it.

00:05:21.094 --> 00:05:22.840
I met the shaman,

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:27.053
and he seemed like an extension
of the river and his jungle.

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:29.672
He asked for my intentions

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:32.188
and listened carefully.

00:05:33.262 --> 00:05:36.373
Then, to my tremendous relief --

00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:39.944
I was freaking out,
to be honest with you --

00:05:39.968 --> 00:05:44.247
a smile began to snake across his face,
and he just laughed.

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:46.568
(Laughter)

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:52.391
I had received the shaman's blessing
to study the river,

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.819
on the condition that after I take
the water samples

00:05:55.843 --> 00:05:57.359
and analyze them in my lab,

00:05:57.383 --> 00:05:59.193
wherever I was in the world,

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:04.031
that I pour the waters
back into the ground

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:06.102
so that, as the shaman said,

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:08.871
the waters could find their way back home.

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.859
I've been back every year
since that first visit in 2011,

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:18.308
and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,

00:06:18.332 --> 00:06:22.129
demanding and at times dangerous.

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:26.128
One story was even featured
in National Geographic Magazine.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:30.239
I was trapped on a small rock
about the size of a sheet of paper

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:32.303
in sandals and board shorts,

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:34.733
in between an 80 degree C river

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:38.486
and a hot spring that, well,
looked like this, close to boiling.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.608
And on top of that,
it was Amazon rain forest.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.712
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:49.298
The temperature differential
made it all white. It was a whiteout.

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:52.361
Intense.

00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:56.596
Now, after years of work,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.262
I'll soon be submitting my geophysical
and geochemical studies for publication.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:07.022
And I'd like to share, today,
with all of you here, on the TED stage,

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:10.236
for the first time,
some of these discoveries.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.871
Well, first off, it's not a legend.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.642
Surprise!

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:17.991
(Laughter)

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:20.529
When I first started the research,

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:23.532
the satellite imagery was too
low-resolution to be meaningful.

00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:25.184
There were just no good maps.

00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:28.145
Thanks to the support
of the Google Earth team,

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.514
I now have this.

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:36.601
Not only that, the indigenous name
of the river, Shanay-timpishka,

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:40.268
"boiled with the heat of the sun,"

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.919
indicating that I'm not the first
to wonder why the river boils,

00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:50.170
and showing that humanity
has always sought to explain

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:51.733
the world around us.

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:55.924
So why does the river boil?

00:07:55.948 --> 00:08:00.361
(Bubbling sounds)

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:02.880
It actually took me three years
to get that footage.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.484
Fault-fed hot springs.

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:11.258
As we have hot blood running
through our veins and arteries,

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:16.330
so, too, the earth has hot water
running through its cracks and faults.

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:20.757
Where these arteries come to the surface,
these earth arteries,

00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.155
we'll get geothermal manifestations:

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:27.199
fumaroles, hot springs
and in our case, the boiling river.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:32.559
What's truly incredible, though,
is the scale of this place.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.567
Next time you cross the road,
think about this.

00:08:36.527 --> 00:08:39.199
The river flows wider than a two-lane road

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:41.087
along most of its path.

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:47.017
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:49.732
Truly impressive.

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:54.077
There are thermal pools
larger than this TED stage,

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.577
and that waterfall that you see there

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:58.639
is six meters tall --

00:08:59.384 --> 00:09:02.676
and all with near-boiling water.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:06.299
We mapped the temperatures
along the river,

00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:09.441
and this was by far the most
demanding part of the fieldwork.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:13.553
And the results were just awesome.

00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:16.730
Sorry -- the geoscientist
in me coming out.

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:19.180
And it showed this amazing trend.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:21.420
You see, the river starts off cold.

00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:24.439
It then heats up, cools back down,
heats up, cools back down,

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.081
heats up again, and then has
this beautiful decay curve

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:29.477
until it smashes into this cold river.

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.333
Now, I understand not all of you
are geothermal scientists,

00:09:33.357 --> 00:09:35.582
so to put it in more everyday terms:

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:38.358
Everyone loves coffee.

00:09:38.382 --> 00:09:39.651
Yes? Good.

00:09:40.517 --> 00:09:44.200
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,

00:09:44.224 --> 00:09:46.334
an extra-hot one, well, 60.

00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:49.067
So, put in coffee shop terms,

00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:51.654
the boiling river plots like this.

00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:53.900
There you have your hot coffee.

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.630
Here you have your extra-hot coffee,

00:09:56.654 --> 00:09:58.828
and you can see
that there's a bit point there

00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:01.840
where the river is still hotter
than even the extra-hot coffee.

00:10:01.864 --> 00:10:03.856
And these are average water temperatures.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.079
We took these in the dry season to ensure
the purest geothermal temperatures.

00:10:08.603 --> 00:10:11.223
But there's a magic number here
that's not being shown,

00:10:11.247 --> 00:10:13.777
and that number is 47 degrees C,

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:17.378
because that's where things start to hurt,

00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:21.575
and I know this from very
personal experience.

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:25.012
Above that temperature,
you don't want to get in that water.

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.698
You need to be careful.

00:10:26.722 --> 00:10:28.037
It can be deadly.

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.995
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:35.198
and what's shocking to me,
is the process is pretty much the same.

00:10:35.898 --> 00:10:38.579
So they fall in and the first thing
to go are the eyes.

00:10:38.603 --> 00:10:41.970
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.
They turn this milky-white color.

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:43.344
The stream is carrying them.

00:10:43.368 --> 00:10:46.431
They're trying to swim out,
but their meat is cooking on the bone

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:47.621
because it's so hot.

00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:49.490
So they're losing power, losing power,

00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:52.904
until finally they get to a point
where hot water goes into their mouths

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:55.149
and they cook from the inside out.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.672
(Laughter)

00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:02.815
A bit sadistic, aren't we?

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:04.179
Jeez.

00:11:05.362 --> 00:11:07.980
Leave them marinating for a little longer.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.196
What's, again, amazing
are these temperatures.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.698
They're similar to things that I've seen
on volcanoes all over the world

00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:18.259
and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:20.204
But here's the thing:

00:11:22.173 --> 00:11:27.172
the data is showing
that the boiling river exists

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:29.486
independent of volcanism.

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:33.911
It's neither magmatic
or volcanic in origin,

00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:41.925
and again, over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center.

00:11:42.543 --> 00:11:46.909
How can a boiling river exist like this?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.946
I've asked geothermal experts
and volcanologists for years,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.787
and I'm still unable to find another
non-volcanic geothermal system

00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:57.378
of this magnitude.

00:11:59.121 --> 00:12:00.645
It's unique.

00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:04.931
It's special on a global scale.

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:09.176
So, still -- how does it work?

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.596
Where do we get this heat?

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:15.279
There's still more research to be done

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:18.492
to better constrain the problem
and better understand the system,

00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:20.842
but from what the data is telling us now,

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:24.230
it looks to be the result
of a large hydrothermal system.

00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:26.611
Basically, it works like this:

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:29.943
So, the deeper you go
into the earth, the hotter it gets.

00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:32.595
We refer to this
as the geothermal gradient.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.388
The waters could be coming
from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,

00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:40.411
then seeping down deep into the earth

00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:43.202
and coming out to form the boiling river

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:46.233
after getting heated up
from the geothermal gradient,

00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:49.550
all due to this unique geologic setting.

00:12:50.587 --> 00:12:53.434
Now, we found
that in and around the river --

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:54.951
this is working with colleagues

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.062
from National Geographic,
Dr. Spencer Wells,

00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:59.796
and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.082
we genetically sequenced
the extremophile lifeforms

00:13:03.106 --> 00:13:07.710
living in and around the river,
and have found new lifeforms,

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:11.149
unique species living
in the boiling river.

00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:17.507
But again, despite all of these studies,
all of these discoveries and the legends,

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:19.499
a question remains:

00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:24.624
What is the significance
of the boiling river?

00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:31.247
What is the significance
of this stationary cloud

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:34.147
that always hovers
over this patch of jungle?

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:37.983
And what is the significance

00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:40.990
of a detail in a childhood legend?

00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:46.655
To the shaman and his community,
it's a sacred site.

00:13:47.414 --> 00:13:49.759
To me, as a geoscientist,

00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:52.626
it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.

00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:57.772
But to the illegal loggers
and cattle farmers,

00:13:57.796 --> 00:14:01.439
it's just another resource to exploit.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.607
And to the Peruvian government,
it's just another stretch

00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:12.575
of unprotected land ready for development.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:17.782
My goal is to ensure
that whoever controls this land

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:21.924
understands the boiling river's
uniqueness and significance.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.630
Because that's the question,

00:14:25.853 --> 00:14:27.487
one of significance.

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:30.897
And the thing there is,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.191
we define significance.

00:14:34.998 --> 00:14:37.658
It's us. We have that power.

00:14:37.682 --> 00:14:40.410
We are the ones who draw that line

00:14:40.434 --> 00:14:42.782
between the sacred and the trivial.

00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:46.012
And in this age,

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:49.534
where everything seems mapped,
measured and studied,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.756
in this age of information,

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.471
I remind you all that discoveries
are not just made

00:14:58.495 --> 00:15:03.058
in the black void of the unknown

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.562
but in the white noise
of overwhelming data.

00:15:09.862 --> 00:15:12.847
There remains so much to explore.

00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.453
We live in an incredible world.

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:18.996
So go out.

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.163
Be curious.

00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:26.754
Because we do live in a world

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:30.819
where shamans still sing
to the spirits of the jungle,

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.240
where rivers do boil

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:37.835
and where legends do come to life.

00:15:39.018 --> 00:15:40.199
Thank you very much.

00:15:40.223 --> 00:15:48.809
(Applause)
