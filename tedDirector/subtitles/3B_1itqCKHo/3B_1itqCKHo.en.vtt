00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.230
Today I'm going to talk about work.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.180
And the question I want to ask
and answer is this:

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.120
"Why do we work?"

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.060
Why do we drag ourselves
out of bed every morning

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.100
instead of living our lives

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.180
just filled with bouncing from one
TED-like adventure to another?

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.010
(Laughter)

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.080
You may be asking yourselves
that very question.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.200
Now, I know of course,
we have to make a living,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.050
but nobody in this room thinks
that that's the answer to the question,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.100
"Why do we work?"

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
For folks in this room,
the work we do is challenging,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.010
it's engaging, it's stimulating,
it's meaningful.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.070
And if we're lucky,
it might even be important.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
So, we wouldn't work
if we didn't get paid,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.040
but that's not why we do what we do.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.090
And in general,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.160
I think we think that material rewards
are a pretty bad reason

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.090
for doing the work that we do.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.130
When we say of somebody
that he's "in it for the money,"

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010
we are not just being descriptive.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.090
(Laughter)

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.120
Now, I think this is totally obvious,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.110
but the very obviousness of it
raises what is for me

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.220
an incredibly profound question.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.040
Why, if this is so obvious,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.130
why is it that for the overwhelming
majority of people on the planet,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.010
the work they do
has none of the characteristics

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.200
that get us up and out of bed
and off to the office every morning?

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.100
How is it that we allow
the majority of people on the planet

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.100
to do work that is monotonous,
meaningless and soul-deadening?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.070
Why is it that as capitalism developed,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.120
it created a mode of production,
of goods and services,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.090
in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions
that might come from work were eliminated?

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.100
Workers who do this kind of work,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.060
whether they do it in factories,
in call centers,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.180
or in fulfillment warehouses,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.180
do it for pay.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.000
There is certainly no other earthly reason
to do what they do except for pay.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.070
So the question is, "Why?"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.220
And here's the answer:

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.100
the answer is technology.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.190
Now, I know, I know --

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.080
yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation
screws people, blah blah --

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.200
that's not what I mean.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.120
I'm not talking about
the kind of technology

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.120
that has enveloped our lives,
and that people come to TED to hear about.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.110
I'm not talking about
the technology of things,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.100
profound though that is.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.090
I'm talking about another technology.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.080
I'm talking about the technology of ideas.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140
I call it, "idea technology" --

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.210
how clever of me.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.030
(Laughter)

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.140
In addition to creating things,
science creates ideas.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.120
Science creates ways of understanding.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.070
And in the social sciences,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.060
the ways of understanding that get created
are ways of understanding ourselves.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.130
And they have an enormous influence
on how we think, what we aspire to,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.030
and how we act.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.200
If you think your poverty
is God's will, you pray.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.160
If you think your poverty is the result
of your own inadequacy,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.110
you shrink into despair.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.210
And if you think your poverty is
the result of oppression and domination,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.220
then you rise up in revolt.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.020
Whether your response to poverty
is resignation or revolution,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.200
depends on how you understand
the sources of your poverty.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.100
This is the role that ideas play
in shaping us as human beings,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.040
and this is why idea technology may be
the most profoundly important technology

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.560
that science gives us.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.020
And there's something special
about idea technology,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.030
that makes it different
from the technology of things.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.180
With things, if the technology sucks,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.230
it just vanishes, right?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.110
Bad technology disappears.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.010
With ideas --

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.050
false ideas about human beings
will not go away

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.480
if people believe that they're true.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.100
Because if people believe
that they're true,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.150
they create ways of living
and institutions

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.010
that are consistent
with these very false ideas.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.040
And that's how the industrial revolution
created a factory system

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.190
in which there was really nothing you
could possibly get out of your day's work,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.070
except for the pay at the end of the day.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.070
Because the father --
one of the fathers

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.120
of the Industrial Revolution,
Adam Smith --

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.100
was convinced that human beings
were by their very natures lazy,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.110
and wouldn't do anything
unless you made it worth their while,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.110
and the way you made it worth their while

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.110
was by incentivizing,
by giving them rewards.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.060
That was the only reason
anyone ever did anything.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.210
So we created a factory system consistent
with that false view of human nature.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.180
But once that system
of production was in place,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.180
there was really no other way
for people to operate,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.030
except in a way that was consistent
with Adam Smith's vision.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
So the work example is merely an example

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.210
of how false ideas
can create a circumstance

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.070
that ends up making them true.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.120
It is not true

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.190
that you "just can't get
good help anymore."

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.040
It is true

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.030
that you "can't get good help anymore"

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.020
when you give people work to do
that is demeaning and soulless.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.090
And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.060
the same guy who gave us
this incredible invention

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.170
of mass production, and division of labor

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.220
-- understood this.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.170
He said, of people who worked
in assembly lines,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.200
of men who worked
in assembly lines, he says:

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.020
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.190
Now, notice the word here is "become."

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.220
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.120
Whether he intended it or not,
what Adam Smith was telling us there,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.030
is that the very shape of the institution
within which people work

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.130
creates people who are fitted
to the demands of that institution

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.030
and deprives people of the opportunity

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.510
to derive the kinds of satisfactions
from their work that we take for granted.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.090
The thing about science --
natural science --

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.210
is that we can spin fantastic
theories about the cosmos,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.160
and have complete confidence

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.430
that the cosmos is completely
indifferent to our theories.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.010
It's going to work the same damn way

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.050
no matter what theories
we have about the cosmos.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.080
But we do have to worry about
the theories we have of human nature,

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.160
because human nature will be changed
by the theories we have

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.160
that are designed to explain
and help us understand human beings.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.140
The distinguished anthropologist,
Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.030
that human beings
are the "unfinished animals."

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.050
And what he meant by that
was that it is only human nature

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.130
to have a human nature

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.000
that is very much the product
of the society in which people live.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.110
That human nature,
that is to say our human nature,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.090
is much more created
than it is discovered.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.140
We design human nature

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.070
by designing the institutions
within which people live and work.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.210
And so you people --

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.030
pretty much the closest I ever get
to being with masters of the universe --

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.020
you people should be asking
yourself a question,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.050
as you go back home
to run your organizations.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.130
Just what kind of human nature
do you want to help design?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.200
Thank you.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.080
(Applause)

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.130
Thanks.
