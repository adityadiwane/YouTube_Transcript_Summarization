00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.030
So, well, I do applied math,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.554
and this is a peculiar problem

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.727
for anyone who does applied math, is that

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:23.660
we are like management consultants.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.606
No one knows what the hell we do.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.880
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.173
to try and explain to you what I do.

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:33.494
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:37.176
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:38.324
you will see later on.

00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:41.014
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise

00:00:41.014 --> 00:00:43.928
and a high level of skill,

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:46.459
and probably a level of initial suitability

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.306
that may well have a genetic component to it.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:51.699
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.786
gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.109
as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.076
a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:02.130
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.074
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:08.522
who have the disease, and they have to live with

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:11.090
incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.947
and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.330
so what we need are objective tools

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.387
to detect the disease before it's too late.

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:20.941
We need to be able to measure progression objectively,

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.114
and ultimately, the only way we're going to know

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:26.306
when we actually have a cure is when we have

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:29.704
an objective measure that can answer that for sure.

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.554
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease

00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:34.907
and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.136
so there's no simple blood test that you can do,

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:38.938
and the best that we have is like

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:41.179
this 20-minute neurologist test.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.637
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.394
and that means that, outside the clinical trials,

00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:49.122
it's just never done. It's never done.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.199
But what if patients could do this test at home?

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:54.297
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:58.551
and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.471
No expensive staff time required.

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:01.889
Takes about $300, by the way,

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.882
in the neurologist's clinic to do it.

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:06.563
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.077
in which we can try to achieve this,

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:09.885
because, you see, in one sense, at least,

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:13.141
we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.

00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.896
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:20.125
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:23.589
and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.803
because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs

00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:28.098
when we make sounds, and we all actually

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:30.394
have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:33.107
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:35.692
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.

00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:38.074
From the sound, we can actually track

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.355
the vocal fold position as it vibrates,

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:42.898
and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,

00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:45.679
so too are the vocal organs.

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.559
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.257
irregular vocal fold tremor.

00:02:49.257 --> 00:02:50.425
We see all the same symptoms.

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:53.355
We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:55.459
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.692
after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.

00:02:57.692 --> 00:03:00.539
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.755
in some cases, but with any digital microphone,

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.300
and using precision voice analysis software

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.709
in combination with the latest in machine learning,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.287
which is very advanced by now,

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:13.173
we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:16.054
on a continuum between health and disease

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:18.650
using voice signals alone.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.964
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against

00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:23.114
expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.

00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:27.096
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.

00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:30.100
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.402
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:35.729
voice-based tests are non-expert.

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.721
That means they can be self-administered.

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.301
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.

00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.595
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:45.035
When something becomes ultra-low cost,

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.331
it becomes massively scalable.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.006
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:53.432
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.744
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.

00:03:55.744 --> 00:03:58.064
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:02.169
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.284
and we can make population-scale screening

00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:05.880
feasible for the first time.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.082
We have the opportunity to start to search

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:11.623
for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:14.381
So, taking the first steps towards this today,

00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.507
we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.739
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.667
to record a very large number of voices worldwide

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:23.807
to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.

00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:25.507
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters

00:04:25.507 --> 00:04:27.117
of a billion people on the planet.

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:30.194
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.333
and leave recordings, a few cents each,

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.523
and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit

00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:38.066
six percent of our target just in eight hours.

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:41.817
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:41.817 --> 00:04:48.137
(Applause)

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:51.712
Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:54.488
let's say, 10,000 people,

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:57.342
you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:59.027
What are you going to get out of those samples?

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:00.857
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,

00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:02.514
during the call you have to indicate whether or not

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:03.781
you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:06.288
ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.

00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:09.005
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:12.413
from all different circumstances, and it's getting it

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:14.318
in different circumstances that matter because then

00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:17.702
we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:19.863
and looking for the actual markers of the disease.

00:05:19.863 --> 00:05:22.360
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.554
ML: It's much better than that.

00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:25.274
Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:27.144
because he's done some fantastic work,

00:05:27.144 --> 00:05:30.914
and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:34.304
which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:35.880
TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.081
So what that means is that people will be able to —

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.933
ML: (Laughs)

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:41.839
TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.911
and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.781
record their voice, and then their doctor can check up

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.462
on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.

00:05:50.462 --> 00:05:51.432
ML: Absolutely.

00:05:51.432 --> 00:05:53.175
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:58.332
ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)
