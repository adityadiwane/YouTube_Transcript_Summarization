00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.396
The last time I heard my son's voice

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.756
was when he walked out the front door

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.060
on his way to school.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.500
He called out one word in the darkness:

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.340
"Bye."

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.820
It was April 20, 1999.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.756
Later that morning,
at Columbine High School,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.716
my son Dylan and his friend Eric

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.060
killed 12 students and a teacher

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.780
and wounded more than 20 others
before taking their own lives.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.036
Thirteen innocent people were killed,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.260
leaving their loved ones
in a state of grief and trauma.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.996
Others sustained injuries,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.060
some resulting in disfigurement
and permanent disability.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.476
But the enormity of the tragedy

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.620
can't be measured only by the number
of deaths and injuries that took place.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.956
There's no way to quantify
the psychological damage

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.916
of those who were in the school,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.300
or who took part
in rescue or cleanup efforts.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.740
There's no way to assess
the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.756
especially when it can be a blueprint

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.220
for other shooters who go on
to commit atrocities of their own.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.260
Columbine was a tidal wave,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.276
and when the crash ended,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.236
it would take years
for the community and for society

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.980
to comprehend its impact.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.660
It has taken me years
to try to accept my son's legacy.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.716
The cruel behavior
that defined the end of his life

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.300
showed me that he was a completely
different person from the one I knew.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.796
Afterwards people asked,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.580
"How could you not know?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.940
What kind of a mother were you?"

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.700
I still ask myself those same questions.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.780
Before the shootings,
I thought of myself as a good mom.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.036
Helping my children become caring,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.396
healthy, responsible adults

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.900
was the most important role of my life.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.900
But the tragedy convinced me
that I failed as a parent,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.380
and it's partially this sense of failure
that brings me here today.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.316
Aside from his father,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.900
I was the one person
who knew and loved Dylan the most.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.876
If anyone could have known
what was happening,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.620
it should have been me, right?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.020
But I didn't know.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.156
Today, I'm here to share the experience

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.900
of what it's like to be the mother
of someone who kills and hurts.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.876
For years after the tragedy,
I combed through memories,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.500
trying to figure out
exactly where I failed as a parent.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.836
But there are no simple answers.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.780
I can't give you any solutions.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.540
All I can do

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.940
is share what I have learned.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.876
When I talk to people
who didn't know me before the shootings,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.700
I have three challenges to meet.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.660
First, when I walk into a room like this,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.876
I never know if someone there
has experienced loss

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.620
because of what my son did.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.036
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering
caused by a member of my family

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.260
who isn't here to do it for himself.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.460
So first, with all of my heart,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.380
I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.220
The second challenge I have

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.580
is that I must ask for understanding
and even compassion

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.620
when I talk about
my son's death as a suicide.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.436
Two years before he died,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.676
he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.260
that he was cutting himself.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.636
He said that he was in agony

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.300
and wanted to get a gun
so he could end his life.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.740
I didn't know about any of this
until months after his death.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.956
When I talk about his death as a suicide,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.020
I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness
he showed at the end of his life.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.636
I'm trying to understand

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.756
how his suicidal thinking

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.220
led to murder.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.116
After a lot of reading
and talking with experts,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.796
I have come to believe

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.540
that his involvement in the shootings
was rooted not in his desire to kill

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.980
but in his desire to die.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.436
The third challenge I have
when I talk about my son's murder-suicide

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.380
is that I'm talking about mental health --

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.716
excuse me --

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.356
is that I'm talking about mental health,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.556
or brain health, as I prefer to call it,
because it's more concrete.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.316
And in the same breath,
I'm talking about violence.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.916
The last thing I want to do
is to contribute to the misunderstanding

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.156
that already exists around mental illness.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.956
Only a very small percent of those
who have a mental illness

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.220
are violent toward other people,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.756
but of those who die by suicide,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.996
it's estimated that about 75
to maybe more than 90 percent

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.420
have a diagnosable
mental health condition of some kind.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.756
As you all know very well,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.740
our mental health care system
is not equipped to help everyone,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.316
and not everyone with destructive thoughts

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.076
fits the criteria

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.260
for a specific diagnosis.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.036
Many who have ongoing feelings

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.796
of fear or anger or hopelessness

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.700
are never assessed or treated.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.100
Too often, they get our attention
only if they reach a behavioral crisis.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.276
If estimates are correct

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.236
that about one
to two percent of all suicides

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.340
involves the murder of another person,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.820
when suicide rates rise,
as they are rising for some populations,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.220
the murder-suicide rates
will rise as well.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.836
I wanted to understand what was going on
in Dylan's mind prior to his death,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.580
so I looked for answers
from other survivors of suicide loss.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.996
I did research and volunteered
to help with fund-raising events,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.796
and whenever I could,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.316
I talked with those who had
survived their own suicidal crisis

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.540
or attempt.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.876
One of the most helpful
conversations I had

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.356
was with a coworker

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.285
who overheard me talking to someone else

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.509
in my office cubicle.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.996
She heard me say
that Dylan could not have loved me

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.780
if he could do something
as horrible as he did.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.620
Later, when she found me alone,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.036
she apologized for overhearing
that conversation,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.620
but told me that I was wrong.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.316
She said that when she was
a young, single mother

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.780
with three small children,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.060
she became severely depressed
and was hospitalized to keep her safe.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.116
At the time, she was certain

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.396
that her children
would be better off if she died,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.660
so she had made a plan to end her life.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.756
She assured me that a mother's love
was the strongest bond on Earth,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.820
and that she loved her children
more than anything in the world,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.676
but because of her illness,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.540
she was sure that they
would be better off without her.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.876
What she said and what
I've learned from others

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.636
is that we do not make
the so-called decision or choice

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.236
to die by suicide

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.116
in the same way
that we choose what car to drive

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.260
or where to go on a Saturday night.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.276
When someone is
in an extremely suicidal state,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.820
they are in a stage four
medical health emergency.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.980
Their thinking is impaired and they've
lost access to tools of self-governance.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.316
Even though they can
make a plan and act with logic,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.276
their sense of truth
is distorted by a filter of pain

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.900
through which they
interpret their reality.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.356
Some people can be very good
at hiding this state,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.740
and they often have
good reasons for doing that.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.836
Many of us have
suicidal thoughts at some point,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.356
but persistent,
ongoing thoughts of suicide

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.596
and devising a means to die

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.956
are symptoms of pathology,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.876
and like many illnesses,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.660
the condition has to be
recognized and treated

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.860
before a life is lost.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.260
But my son's death
was not purely a suicide.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.780
It involved mass murder.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.780
I wanted to know how his
suicidal thinking became homicidal.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.900
But research is sparse
and there are no simple answers.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.979
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:58.060
He had a personality
that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.700
and that made him less likely
to seek help from others.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.156
He had experienced
triggering events at the school

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.580
that left him feeling
debased and humiliated and mad.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.236
And he had a complicated friendship

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.596
with a boy who shared his feelings
of rage and alienation,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.716
and who was seriously disturbed,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.620
controlling and homicidal.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.956
And on top of this period in his life

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.140
of extreme vulnerability and fragility,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.476
Dylan found access to guns

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.660
even though we'd never
owned any in our home.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.836
It was appallingly easy
for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.500
both legally and illegally,
without my permission or knowledge.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.220
And somehow, 17 years
and many school shootings later,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.700
it's still appallingly easy.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.700
What Dylan did that day broke my heart,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.916
and as trauma so often does,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.900
it took a toll on my body and on my mind.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.620
Two years after the shootings,
I got breast cancer,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.380
and two years after that,
I began to have mental health problems.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.716
On top of the constant, perpetual grief

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.316
I was terrified that I would run
into a family member

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.396
of someone Dylan had killed,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.796
or be accosted by the press

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.300
or by an angry citizen.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.316
I was afraid to turn on the news,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.300
afraid to hear myself being called
a terrible parent or a disgusting person.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.180
I started having panic attacks.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.236
The first bout started
four years after the shootings,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.796
when I was getting ready
for the depositions

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.620
and would have to meet
the victims' families face to face.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.796
The second round started
six years after the shootings,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.276
when I was preparing
to speak publicly about murder-suicide

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.300
for the first time at a conference.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.740
Both episodes lasted several weeks.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.116
The attacks happened everywhere:

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.436
in the hardware store, in my office,

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.500
or even while reading a book in bed.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.476
My mind would suddenly lock
into this spinning cycle of terror

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.596
and no matter how I hard I tried

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.676
to calm myself down
or reason my way out of it,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.980
I couldn't do it.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.820
It felt as if my brain
was trying to kill me,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.316
and then, being afraid of being afraid

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.140
consumed all of my thoughts.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.916
That's when I learned firsthand

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.380
what it feels like
to have a malfunctioning mind,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.940
and that's when I truly
became a brain health advocate.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.556
With therapy and medication and self-care,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.396
life eventually returned

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.900
to whatever could be thought of
as normal under the circumstances.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.116
When I looked back
on all that had happened,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.700
I could see that my son's
spiral into dysfunction

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.996
probably occurred
over a period of about two years,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.180
plenty of time to get him help,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.116
if only someone had known
that he needed help

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.460
and known what to do.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.076
Every time someone asks me,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.556
"How could you not have known?",

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.580
it feels like a punch in the gut.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.196
It carries accusation
and taps into my feelings of guilt

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.716
that no matter how much therapy I've had

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.660
I will never fully eradicate.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.320
But here's something I've learned:

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.396
if love were enough

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.556
to stop someone who is suicidal

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.020
from hurting themselves,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.020
suicides would hardly ever happen.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.940
But love is not enough,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.820
and suicide is prevalent.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.316
It's the second leading cause of death

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.540
for people age 10 to 34,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.116
and 15 percent of American youth

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.876
report having made a suicide plan

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.100
in the last year.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.100
I've learned that no matter
how much we want to believe we can,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.636
we cannot know or control

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.620
everything our loved ones think and feel,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.700
and the stubborn belief
that we are somehow different,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.796
that someone we love
would never think of hurting themselves

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.020
or someone else,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.916
can cause us to miss

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.740
what's hidden in plain sight.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.100
And if worst case scenarios
do come to pass,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.236
we'll have to learn
to forgive ourselves for not knowing

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.956
or for not asking the right questions

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.700
or not finding the right treatment.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.316
We should always assume

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.980
that someone we love may be suffering,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.316
regardless of what they say

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.580
or how they act.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.660
We should listen with our whole being,

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.820
without judgments,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.620
and without offering solutions.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.396
I know that I will live with this tragedy,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.356
with these multiple tragedies,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.940
for the rest of my life.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.140
I know that in the minds of many,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.660
what I lost can't compare
to what the other families lost.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.660
I know my struggle
doesn't make theirs any easier.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.196
I know there are even some who think
I don't have the right to any pain,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.060
but only to a life of permanent penance.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.300
In the end what I know comes down to this:

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:03.316
the tragic fact is that even
the most vigilant and responsible of us

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.260
may not be able to help,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.836
but for love's sake,

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.036
we must never stop trying

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.540
to know the unknowable.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.596
Thank you.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.780
(Applause)
