00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:15.476
I want to start by doing an experiment.

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.307
I'm going to play three videos
of a rainy day.

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:24.819
But I've replaced the audio
of one of the videos,

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:27.217
and instead of the sound of rain,

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.309
I've added the sound of bacon frying.

00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:35.109
So I want you think carefully
which one the clip with the bacon is.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:37.607
(Rain falls)

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:41.300
(Rain falls)

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.532
(Rain falls)

00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:53.893
All right.

00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:57.638
Actually, I lied.

00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:58.932
They're all bacon.

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.531
(Bacon sizzles)

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:06.303
(Applause)

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:12.489
My point here isn't really
to make you hungry

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:14.162
every time you see a rainy scene,

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:20.106
but it's to show that our brains
are conditioned to embrace the lies.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.794
We're not looking for accuracy.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:26.539
So on the subject of deception,

00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:29.926
I wanted to quote one
of my favorite authors.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.899
In "The Decay of Lying,"
Oscar Wilde establishes the idea

00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:42.532
that all bad art comes from copying
nature and being realistic;

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:48.340
and all great art comes
from lying and deceiving,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.063
and telling beautiful, untrue things.

00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:56.001
So when you're watching a movie

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.402
and a phone rings,

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:00.428
it's not actually ringing.

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:05.196
It's been added later
in postproduction in a studio.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.074
All of the sounds you hear are fake.

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.908
Everything, apart from the dialogue,

00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:11.086
is fake.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.770
When you watch a movie and you see
a bird flapping its wings --

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:16.815
(Wings flap)

00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:20.404
They haven't really recorded the bird.

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:25.422
It sounds a lot more realistic
if you record a sheet

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:26.998
or shaking kitchen gloves.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.374
(Flaps)

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.792
The burning of a cigarette up close --

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.813
(Cigarette burns)

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.102
It actually sounds a lot more authentic

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.971
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.213
and release it.

00:02:44.237 --> 00:02:47.380
(A Saran Warp ball being released)

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.272
Punches?

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:50.818
(Punch)

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.774
Oops, let me play that again.

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:53.997
(Punch)

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:58.271
That's often done by sticking
a knife in vegetables,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.717
usually cabbage.

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:02.113
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)

00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:05.752
The next one -- it's breaking bones.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:08.001
(Bones break)

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.004
Well, no one was really harmed.

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:12.428
It's actually ...

00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.418
breaking celery or frozen lettuce.

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:18.483
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)

00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:20.179
(Laughter)

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:25.968
Making the right sounds
is not always as easy

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:27.899
as a trip to the supermarket

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:30.619
and going to the vegetable section.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.018
But it's often a lot more
complicated than that.

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:36.065
So let's reverse-engineer together

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.413
the creation of a sound effect.

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:41.786
One of my favorite stories
comes from Frank Serafine.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.661
He's a contributor to our library,

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.247
and a great sound designer for "Tron"
and "Star Trek" and others.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:53.549
He was part of the Paramount team
that won the Oscar for best sound

00:03:53.573 --> 00:03:55.504
for "The Hunt for Red October."

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:58.918
In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,

00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:03.727
they were asked to produce the sound
of the propeller of the submarine.

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:05.096
So they had a small problem:

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.640
they couldn't really find
a submarine in West Hollywood.

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:12.322
So basically, what they did is,

00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:15.701
they went to a friend's swimming pool,

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:20.260
and Frank performed
a cannonball, or bomba.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.265
They placed an underwater mic

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.065
and an overhead mic
outside the swimming pool.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:29.342
So here's what the underwater
mic sounds like.

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:30.901
(Underwater plunge)

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:33.114
Adding the overhead mic,

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:35.091
it sounded a bit like this:

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:37.490
(Water splashes)

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:41.961
So now they took the sound
and pitched it one octave down,

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:44.461
sort of like slowing down a record.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.266
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.697
And then they removed
a lot of the high frequencies.

00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.996
(Water splashes)

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.076
And pitched it down another octave.

00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:58.602
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:01.132
And then they added
a little bit of the splash

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:03.440
from the overhead microphone.

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:06.629
(Water splashes)

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:09.191
And by looping and repeating that sound,

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:10.405
they got this:

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:13.270
(Propeller churns)

00:05:16.463 --> 00:05:22.991
So, creativity and technology put together
in order to create the illusion

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:26.186
that we're inside the submarine.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:30.229
But once you've created your sounds

00:05:30.253 --> 00:05:32.647
and you've synced them to the image,

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:36.722
you want those sounds to live
in the world of the story.

00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:41.431
And one the best ways to do
that is to add reverb.

00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:44.612
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.

00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:50.320
Reverberation, or reverb,
is the persistence of the sound

00:05:50.344 --> 00:05:52.275
after the original sound has ended.

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.867
So it's sort of like the --

00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:57.927
all the reflections from the materials,

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.838
the objects and the walls
around the sound.

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.074
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.

00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:06.100
The original sound is less
than half a second long.

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:09.288
(Gunshot)

00:06:09.747 --> 00:06:11.436
By adding reverb,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.677
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.033
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)

00:06:17.057 --> 00:06:20.562
Or like it was recorded
inside a chapel or a church.

00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:22.440
(Gunshot reverbs church)

00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:25.047
Or in a canyon.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.960
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)

00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:30.637
So reverb gives us a lot of information

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:35.591
about the space between the listener
and the original sound source.

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.724
If the sound is the taste,

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:41.932
then reverb is sort of like
the smell of the sound.

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:44.467
But reverb can do a lot more.

00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:48.401
Listening to a sound
with a lot less reverberation

00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:50.508
than the on-screen action

00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:53.552
is going to immediately signify to us

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:56.219
that we're listening to a commentator,

00:06:56.243 --> 00:07:01.034
to an objective narrator that's not
participating in the on-screen action.

00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:06.662
Also, emotionally intimate
moments in cinema

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.633
are often heard with zero reverb,

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:12.627
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.

00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:14.985
On the completely other side,

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:17.505
adding a lot of reverb to a voice

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:20.906
is going to make us think
that we're listening to a flashback,

00:07:21.637 --> 00:07:24.946
or perhaps that we're inside
the head of a character

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:28.422
or that we're listening
to the voice of God.

00:07:28.446 --> 00:07:30.708
Or, even more powerful in film,

00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:32.219
Morgan Freeman.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.527
(Laughter)

00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:34.718
So --

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:36.972
(Applause)

00:07:37.502 --> 00:07:41.373
But what are some other tools or hacks

00:07:41.397 --> 00:07:43.257
that sound designers use?

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:46.489
Well, here's a really big one.

00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:53.198
It's silence.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.411
A few moments of silence
is going to make us pay attention.

00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:00.321
And in the Western world,

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:02.468
we're not really used to verbal silences.

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:05.521
They're considered awkward or rude.

00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:10.110
So silence preceding verbal communication

00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.081
can create a lot of tension.

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:16.810
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:21.178
where it's full of explosions
and automatic guns.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:25.984
Loud stops being loud
anymore, after a while.

00:08:26.008 --> 00:08:27.952
So in a yin-yang way,

00:08:27.976 --> 00:08:31.113
silence needs loudness
and loudness needs silence

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:33.535
for either of them to have any effect.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.727
But what does silence mean?

00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:38.689
Well, it depends how
it's used in each film.

00:08:39.416 --> 00:08:42.595
Silence can place us inside
the head of a character

00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:44.237
or provoke thought.

00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:47.314
We often relate silences with ...

00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:49.972
contemplation,

00:08:50.558 --> 00:08:51.815
meditation,

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.752
being deep in thought.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.671
But apart from having one meaning,

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:01.865
silence becomes a blank canvas

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:06.414
upon which the viewer is invited
to the paint their own thoughts.

00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:10.638
But I want to make it clear:
there is no such thing as silence.

00:09:11.192 --> 00:09:15.637
And I know this sounds like the most
pretentious TED Talk statement ever.

00:09:16.835 --> 00:09:22.140
But even if you were to enter
a room with zero reverberation

00:09:22.164 --> 00:09:24.229
and zero external sounds,

00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:27.370
you would still be able to hear
the pumping of your own blood.

00:09:28.004 --> 00:09:32.321
And in cinema, traditionally,
there was never a silent moment

00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:34.265
because of the sound of the projector.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:37.163
And even in today's Dolby world,

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:41.315
there's not really any moment of silence
if you listen around you.

00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:44.710
There's always some sort of noise.

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.661
Now, since there's no such
thing as silence,

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:51.256
what do filmmakers
and sound designers use?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.776
Well, as a synonym,
they often use ambiences.

00:09:56.307 --> 00:10:00.176
Ambiences are the unique background sounds

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.248
that are specific to each location.

00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:05.121
Each location has a unique sound,

00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:07.121
and each room has a unique sound,

00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:08.718
which is called room tone.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:11.165
So here's a recording
of a market in Morocco.

00:10:11.189 --> 00:10:14.129
(Voices, music)

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.238
And here's a recording
of Times Square in New York.

00:10:20.843 --> 00:10:25.366
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.071
Room tone is the addition of all
the noises inside the room:

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.484
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.419
Here's a recording
of my apartment in Brooklyn.

00:10:36.443 --> 00:10:41.321
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
the fridge and street traffic)

00:10:47.422 --> 00:10:51.726
Ambiences work in a most primal way.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:55.572
They can speak directly
to our brain subconsciously.

00:10:56.538 --> 00:11:02.387
So, birds chirping outside your window
may indicate normality,

00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:05.728
perhaps because, as a species,

00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:09.889
we've been used to that sound
every morning for millions of years.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.303
(Birds chirp)

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:21.480
On the other hand, industrial sounds
have been introduced to us

00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:22.995
a little more recently.

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:26.027
Even though I really like
them personally --

00:11:26.051 --> 00:11:28.464
they've been used by one
of my heroes, David Lynch,

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.423
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --

00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:33.009
industrial sounds often carry
negative connotations.

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:35.787
(Machine noises)

00:11:40.092 --> 00:11:44.948
Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.226
Occasionally, they can be so significant

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.824
that they become a character in a movie.

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:57.174
The sound of thunder may indicate
divine intervention or anger.

00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:01.338
(Thunder)

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:07.932
Church bells can remind us
of the passing of time,

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.861
or perhaps our own mortality.

00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:15.341
(Bells ring)

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:24.263
And breaking of glass can
indicate the end of a relationship

00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:25.515
or a friendship.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.191
(Glass breaks)

00:12:28.788 --> 00:12:32.341
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,

00:12:32.365 --> 00:12:37.136
for example, brass or wind
instruments played very loud,

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:42.882
may remind us of animal howls in nature

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:46.033
and therefore create a sense
of irritation or fear.

00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:49.437
(Brass and wind instruments play)

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:55.886
So now we've spoken
about on-screen sounds.

00:12:56.298 --> 00:13:00.931
But occasionally, the source
of a sound cannot be seen.

00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:03.479
That's what we call offscreen sounds,

00:13:03.503 --> 00:13:04.951
or "acousmatic."

00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:07.275
Acousmatic sounds --

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:12.920
well, the term "acousmatic" comes
from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:16.535
who used to teach behind
a veil or curtain for years,

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:19.749
not revealing himself to his disciples.

00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:22.561
I think the mathematician
and philosopher thought that,

00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:24.878
in that way,

00:13:25.584 --> 00:13:29.621
his students might focus
more on the voice,

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.609
and his words and its meaning,

00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:34.803
rather than the visual of him speaking.

00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:37.526
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.364
or "1984's" Big Brother,

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:45.654
separating the voice from its source,

00:13:45.678 --> 00:13:47.569
separating cause and effect

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:52.174
sort of creates a sense
of ubiquity or panopticism,

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.278
and therefore, authority.

00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:58.217
There's a strong tradition
of acousmatic sound.

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:05.739
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice
used to sing in rooms

00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:09.622
up in galleries close to the ceiling,

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:13.586
creating the illusion that we're listening
to angels up in the sky.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.080
Richard Wagner famously
created the hidden orchestra

00:14:18.104 --> 00:14:21.940
that was placed in a pit
between the stage and the audience.

00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:27.007
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
famously hid in dark corners of clubs.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.163
I think what all these masters knew
is that by hiding the source,

00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:33.850
you create a sense of mystery.

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.943
This has been seen
in cinema over and over,

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:39.047
with Hitchcock,
and Ridley Scott in "Alien."

00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:41.463
Hearing a sound without knowing its source

00:14:41.487 --> 00:14:44.712
is going to create some sort of tension.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:52.144
Also, it can minimize certain visual
restrictions that directors have

00:14:52.168 --> 00:14:55.858
and can show something
that wasn't there during filming.

00:14:55.882 --> 00:14:57.967
And if all this sounds
a little theoretical,

00:14:57.991 --> 00:15:00.397
I wanted to play a little video.

00:15:01.289 --> 00:15:03.816
(Toy squeaks)

00:15:04.383 --> 00:15:07.034
(Typewriter)

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.267
(Drums)

00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:13.485
(Ping-pong)

00:15:14.484 --> 00:15:17.444
(Knives being sharpened)

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:20.832
(Record scratches)

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:22.591
(Saw cuts)

00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:24.072
(Woman screams)

00:15:24.663 --> 00:15:28.458
What I'm sort of trying
to demonstrate with these tools

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.119
is that sound is a language.

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:35.658
It can trick us by transporting
us geographically;

00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:38.087
it can change the mood;

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.000
it can set the pace;

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.936
it can make us laugh
or it can make us scared.

00:15:46.698 --> 00:15:50.048
On a personal level, I fell
in love with that language

00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:51.389
a few years ago,

00:15:51.413 --> 00:15:56.020
and somehow managed to make it
into some sort of profession.

00:15:57.274 --> 00:16:00.500
And I think with our work
through the sound library,

00:16:00.524 --> 00:16:06.320
we're trying to kind of expand
the vocabulary of that language.

00:16:07.797 --> 00:16:11.279
And in that way, we want
to offer the right tools

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.943
to sound designers,

00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:14.315
filmmakers,

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:16.174
and video game and app designers,

00:16:16.748 --> 00:16:19.883
to keep telling even better stories

00:16:20.382 --> 00:16:23.114
and creating even more beautiful lies.

00:16:23.138 --> 00:16:24.425
So thanks for listening.

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:27.968
(Applause)
