00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
one, the rise of a culture of availability;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and two, a request.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
So we're seeing a rise of this availability

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
being driven by mobile device proliferation,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
globally, across all social strata.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
an expectation of availability.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
And, with that, comes the third point,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
And the problem is, we're still working through,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
from a societal standpoint,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
how we allow people to be available.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
There's a significant delta, in fact,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
between what we're willing to accept.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Apologies to Hans Rosling --

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
but the big delta there

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
to cover up.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
This first one's called "the lean."

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and then quickly checking the device.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160
"The stretch."

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
I'm going to check my device."

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
But the guy, here, on the right,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
he's doing the stretch.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
to get that device just below the tabletop.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
(Laughter)

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
Nothing says "I love you"

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Or, this one, coming to us from India.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
You can find this on YouTube,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160
while text messaging.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
That is actually the device.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
What this is doing is, we find a --

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
(Laughter)

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
a direct collision --

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
we find a direct collision between availability --

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
and what's possible through availability --

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
the need to create shared narratives.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
We're very good at creating personal narratives,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And when you're standing with someone,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
and you're on your mobile device,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
effectively what you're saying to them is,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
"You are not as important as, literally,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
almost anything that could come to me through this device."

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
Look around you.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
There might be somebody on one right now,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
participating in multi-dimensional engagement.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
(Laughter)

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Our reality right now is less interesting

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
than the story we're going to tell about it later.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
This one I love.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
This poor kid, clearly a prop --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
don't get me wrong, a willing prop --

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
This is the sound of one hand clapping.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
So, as we lose the context of our identity,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
it becomes incredibly important

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
becomes the context in which we live.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
becomes who we are.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
People aren't simply projecting identity,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
they're creating it.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160
We are creating the technology

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
that is going to create the new shared experience,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
which will create the new world.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
And so my request is,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
please, let's make technologies

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
that make people more human,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
and not less.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
Thank you.
