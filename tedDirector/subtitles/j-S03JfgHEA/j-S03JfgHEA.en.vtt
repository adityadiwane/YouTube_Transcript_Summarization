00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:15.769
So this is Anna Hazare,

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.677
and Anna Hazare may well be
the most cutting-edge

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.914
digital activist in the world today.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:24.452
And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.

00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:30.099
Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian 
anticorruption and social justice activist.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.690
And in 2011, he was running a big campaign

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650
to address everyday corruption in India,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.521
a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:41.103
So as part of this campaign,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.025
he was using all of the traditional tactics

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.241
that a good Gandhian organizer would use.

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.297
So he was on a hunger strike,

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.822
and Hazare realized through his hunger

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.599
that actually maybe this time,

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:53.345
in the 21st century,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.834
a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:59.126
So he started playing around 
with mobile activism.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.013
So the first thing he did 
is he said to people,

00:01:01.013 --> 00:01:03.084
"Okay, why don't you send me

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.845
a text message if you support

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.585
my campaign against corruption?"

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:08.854
So he does this, he 
gives people a short code,

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:11.470
and about 80,000 people do it.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.438
Okay, that's pretty respectable.

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:14.375
But then he decides,

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.495
"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:20.970
He says, "Why don't you leave
me a missed call?"

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.039
Now, for those of you who have
lived in the global South,

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.531
you'll know that missed calls

00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.374
are a really critical part
of global mobile culture.

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:30.488
I see people nodding.

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.596
People leave missed calls all the time:

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:34.542
If you're running late for a meeting

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.848
and you just want to let them
know that you're on the way,

00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:38.571
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:40.497
If you're dating someone and 
you just want to say "I miss you"

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:41.883
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.427
So a note for a dating tip here,

00:01:44.427 --> 00:01:45.552
in some cultures,

00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:46.834
if you want to please your lover,

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:51.335
you call them and hang up.
(Laughter)

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.690
So why do people leave missed calls?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.140
Well, the reason of course is that

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.898
they're trying to avoid charges

00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:02.264
associated with making calls
and sending texts.

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:06.320
So when Hazare asked people 
to leave him a missed call,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.997
let's have a little guess how 
many people actually did this?

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:15.415
Thirty-five million.

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:19.458
So this is one of the largest coordinated
actions in human history.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.212
It's remarkable.

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:25.712
And this reflects the extraordinary strength 
of the emerging Indian middle class

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.684
and the power that their
mobile phones bring.

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:30.269
But he used that,

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.488
Hazare ended up with this massive 
CSV file of mobile phone numbers,

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.273
and he used that to deploy

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:38.269
real people power on the ground

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.683
to get hundreds of thousands of
people out on the streets in Delhi

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:46.033
to make a national point of 
everyday corruption in India.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.470
It's a really striking story.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.680
So this is me when I was 12 years old.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.392
I hope you see the resemblance.

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:54.317
And I was also an activist,

00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:56.557
and I have been an activist all my life.

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:57.887
I had this really funny childhood

00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:59.910
where I traipsed around the world

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.704
meeting world leaders and 
Noble prize winners,

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:04.990
talking about Third World debt,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.279
as it was then called,

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.813
and demilitarization.

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:12.045
I was a very, very serious child.
(Laughter)

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.950
And back then,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.384
in the early '90s,

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:19.214
I had a very cutting-edge
tech tool of my own:

00:03:19.214 --> 00:03:21.466
the fax.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.644
And the fax was the 
tool of my activism.

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:25.202
And at that time, it was the best way

00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:27.097
to get a message to a lot of people

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:29.535
all at once.

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:31.981
I'll give you one example of a fax
campaign that I ran.

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.077
It was the eve of the Gulf War

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:37.628
and I organized a global campaign 
to flood the hotel,

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:39.109
the Intercontinental in Geneva,

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.664
where James Baker and Tariq Aziz

00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:42.588
were meeting on the eve of the war,

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.972
and I thought if I could 
flood them with faxes,

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:46.050
we'll stop the war.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.243
Well, unsurprisingly,

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:51.834
that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:53.488
There are lots of reasons for that,

00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:55.973
but there's no doubt that 
one sputtering fax machine

00:03:55.973 --> 00:03:59.300
in Geneva was a little bit
of a bandwidth constraint

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.142
in terms of the ability to 
get a message to lots of people.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:06.172
And so, I went on to 
discover some better tools.

00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:08.814
I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the 
Internet to mobilize people

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.412
and now has almost 
40 million members,

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:13.972
and I now run Purpose, which 
is a home for these kinds of

00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:16.268
technology-powered movements.

00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:18.088
So what's the moral of this story?

00:04:18.088 --> 00:04:19.596
Is the moral of this story,

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:24.705
you know what, the fax is kind of
eclipsed by the mobile phone?

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:26.935
This is another story of 
tech-determinism?

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:30.125
Well, I would argue that there's 
actually more to it than that.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.798
I'd argue that in the last 20 years,

00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:35.036
something more fundamental has changed

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:36.741
than just new tech.

00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:39.561
I would argue that there has
been a fundamental shift

00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:41.709
in the balance of power

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:43.228
in the world.

00:04:43.228 --> 00:04:45.145
You ask any activist how 
to understand the world,

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:47.619
and they'll say,
"Look at where the power is,

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:50.077
who has it, how it's shifting."

00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:53.079
And I think we all sense that 
something big is happening.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:55.523
So Henry Timms and I —

00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:57.371
Henry's a fellow movement builder —

00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.273
got talking one day and 
we started to think,

00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:01.274
how can we make sense of this new world?

00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:02.463
How can we describe it and give

00:05:02.463 --> 00:05:04.906
it a framework that makes it more useful?

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:06.136
Because we realized that many

00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:08.950
of the lessons that we were
discovering in movements

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.657
actually applied all over the world

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:13.779
in many sectors of our society.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.656
So I want to introduce you to
this framework:

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.876
Old power, meet new power.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:21.307
And I want to talk to you about
what new power is today.

00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:23.271
New power is the deployment

00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:26.460
of mass participation 
and peer coordination —

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.102
these are the two key elements —

00:05:28.102 --> 00:05:30.599
to create change and shift outcomes.

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.687
And we see new power all around us.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:34.971
This is Beppe Grillo

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:37.116
he was a populist Italian blogger

00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:40.536
who, with a minimal political apparatus
and only some online tools,

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:43.034
won more than 25 percent of the vote

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:45.455
in recent Italian elections.

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:46.817
This is Airbnb,

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:48.566
which in just a few years

00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:50.728
has radically disrupted the hotel industry

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:53.646
without owning a single
square foot of real estate.

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:55.001
This is Kickstarter,

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.898
which we know has raised over a billion dollars

00:05:57.898 --> 00:06:00.319
from more than five million people.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.249
Now, we're familiar with all of these models.

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:05.450
But what's striking is the commonalities,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.576
the structural features of 
these new models

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.725
and how they differ from old power.

00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:11.394
Let's look a little bit at this.

00:06:11.394 --> 00:06:14.552
Old power is held like a currency.

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:16.531
New power works like a current.

00:06:16.531 --> 00:06:19.033
Old power is held by a few.

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:22.473
New power isn't held by a few,
it's made by many.

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:24.980
Old power is all about download,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.706
and new power uploads.

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:29.240
And you see a whole set of 
characteristics that you can trace,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.356
whether it's in media or 
politics or education.

00:06:32.356 --> 00:06:34.422
So we've talked a little bit 
about what new power is.

00:06:34.422 --> 00:06:37.587
Let's, for a second, talk about 
what new power isn't.

00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:41.383
New power is not your Facebook page.

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:44.208
I assure you that having a 
social media strategy

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:46.756
can enable you to do just as much download

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:49.618
as you used to do when you had the radio.

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:53.146
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:54.888
I assure you that his Facebook page

00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:59.015
has not embraced the power
of participation.

00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:02.413
New power is not inherently positive.

00:07:02.413 --> 00:07:04.702
In fact, this isn't an normative
argument that we're making,

00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:06.514
there are many good things 
about new power,

00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:08.331
but it can produce bad outcomes.

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:10.336
More participation, more peer coordination,

00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:12.123
sometimes distorts outcomes

00:07:12.123 --> 00:07:13.198
and there are some things,

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:15.297
like things, for example, 
in the medical profession

00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:18.293
that we want new power 
to get nowhere near.

00:07:18.293 --> 00:07:21.296
And thirdly, new power is not
the inevitable victor.

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.875
In fact, unsurprisingly,

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.864
as many of these new power
models get to scale,

00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:28.334
what you see is this massive pushback

00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:30.083
from the forces of old power.

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.292
Just look at this really 
interesting epic struggle

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:36.675
going on right now between 
Edward Snowden and the NSA.

00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:39.059
You'll note that only one of 
the two people on this slide

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.238
is currently in exile.

00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:42.653
And so, it's not at all clear

00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:44.743
that new power will be 
the inevitable victor.

00:07:44.743 --> 00:07:47.686
That said, keep one thing in mind:

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:50.575
We're at the beginning of a
very steep curve.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:52.216
So you think about some of 
these new power models, right?

00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:54.328
These were just like someone's

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:56.874
garage idea a few years ago,

00:07:56.874 --> 00:08:00.010
and now they're disrupting 
entire industries.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.679
And so, what's interesting
about new power,

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.695
is the way it feeds
on itself.

00:08:04.695 --> 00:08:06.719
Once you have an experience of new power,

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.909
you tend to expect and 
want more of it.

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:11.789
So let's say you've used a
peer-to-peer lending platform

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.323
like Lending Tree or Prosper,

00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:16.607
then you've figured out that
you don't need the bank,

00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:18.544
and who wants the bank, right?

00:08:18.544 --> 00:08:20.982
And so, that experience tends 
to embolden you

00:08:20.982 --> 00:08:23.919
it tends to make you want
more participation

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.264
across more aspects of your life.

00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:27.809
And what this gives rise to is

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:29.380
a set of values.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.690
We talked about the models

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.284
that new power has engendered —

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:34.116
the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.

00:08:34.116 --> 00:08:35.645
What about the values?

00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:37.315
And this is an early sketch

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:39.878
at what new power values look like.

00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:43.009
New power values prize
transparency above all else.

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:45.231
It's almost a religious 
belief in transparency,

00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.495
a belief that if you shine 
a light on something,

00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:48.926
it will be better.

00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:51.676
And remember that in the 20th 
century, this was not at all true.

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.643
People thought that gentlemen
should sit behind closed doors

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:56.925
and make comfortable agreements.

00:08:56.925 --> 00:09:00.330
New power values of informal,
networked governance.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.974
New power folks would never 
have invented the U.N. today,

00:09:02.974 --> 00:09:04.807
for better or worse.

00:09:04.807 --> 00:09:06.522
New power values participation,

00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:09.317
and new power is all about do-it-yourself.

00:09:09.317 --> 00:09:10.806
In fact, what's interesting 
about new power

00:09:10.806 --> 00:09:14.519
is that it eschews some of 
the professionalization

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:15.994
and specialization that was

00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:18.384
all the rage in the 20th century.

00:09:18.384 --> 00:09:20.194
So what's interesting about these

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.160
new power values and these
new power models

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.455
is what they mean for organizations.

00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:26.963
So we've spent a bit of time thinking,

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:29.229
how can we plot organizations

00:09:29.229 --> 00:09:31.493
on a two-by-two where, essentially,

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:33.549
we look at new power values

00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:34.813
and new power models

00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:36.614
and see where different people sit?

00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:38.503
We started with a U.S. analysis,

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:40.879
and let me show you 
some interesting findings.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.858
So the first is Apple.

00:09:42.858 --> 00:09:45.393
In this framework, we actually
described Apple

00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:47.515
as an old power company.

00:09:47.515 --> 00:09:49.169
That's because the ideology,

00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:51.457
the governing ideology of Apple

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.331
is the ideology of the perfectionist

00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.355
product designer in Cupertino.

00:09:56.355 --> 00:10:00.427
It's absolutely about that beautiful, 
perfect thing descending upon us

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:01.778
in perfection.

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:04.401
And it does not value, as a 
company, transparency.

00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:06.064
In fact, it's very secretive.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.890
Now, Apple is one of the most
succesful companies in the world.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.262
So this shows that you can

00:10:10.262 --> 00:10:12.951
still pursue a successful 
old power strategy.

00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.921
But one can argue that there's 
real vulnerabilites in that model.

00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:17.945
I think another interesting comparison

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:20.122
is that of the Obama campaign

00:10:20.122 --> 00:10:23.238
versus the Obama presidency.

00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:30.700
(Applause)

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.447
Now, I like President Obama,

00:10:32.447 --> 00:10:36.403
but he ran with new 
power at his back, right?

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.230
And he said to people,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.203
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:10:40.203 --> 00:10:41.654
And he used crowdfunding

00:10:41.654 --> 00:10:42.865
to power a campaign.

00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:44.266
But when he got into office,

00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:47.458
he governed like more or less 
all the other presidents did.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:49.822
And this is a really interesting trend,

00:10:49.822 --> 00:10:51.820
is when new power gets powerful,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.391
what happens?

00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:55.155
So this is a framework you 
should look at

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.647
and think about where your
own organization

00:10:56.647 --> 00:10:57.611
sits on it.

00:10:57.611 --> 00:10:59.184
And think about where it
should be 

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:00.732
in five or 10 years.

00:11:00.732 --> 00:11:03.197
So what do you do if you're old power?

00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:06.162
Well, if you're there 
thinking, in old power,

00:11:06.162 --> 00:11:08.062
this won't happen to us.

00:11:08.062 --> 00:11:13.229
Then just look at the Wikipedia
entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.

00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:15.625
Let me tell you, it's a very sad read.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.044
But if you are old power,

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:20.837
the most important thing you 
can do is to occupy yourself

00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:23.491
before others occupy you,

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:24.819
before you are occupied.

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:27.592
Imagine that a group
of your biggest skeptics

00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:29.944
are camped in the heart
of your organization

00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:31.823
asking the toughest questions

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:34.751
and they can see everything
inside of your organization.

00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:37.501
And ask them, would they 
like what they see

00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.776
and should our model change?

00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:41.639
What about if you're new power?

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.273
Is new power kind of just 
riding the wave to glory?

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:45.753
I would argue no.

00:11:45.753 --> 00:11:47.709
I would argue that there
are some very real challenges

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.401
to new power in this nascent phase.

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:52.903
Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street
example for a moment.

00:11:52.903 --> 00:11:55.893
Occupy was this incredible example 
of new power,

00:11:55.893 --> 00:11:57.736
the purest example of new power.

00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:00.267
And yet, it failed to consolidate.

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:02.164
So the energy that it created

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.605
was great for the meme phase,

00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:06.406
but they were so committed to participation,

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:08.040
that they never got anything done.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.831
And in fact that model

00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:12.623
means that the challenge for new power is:

00:12:12.623 --> 00:12:15.162
how do you use institutional power

00:12:15.162 --> 00:12:17.233
without being institutionalized?

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:19.866
One the other end of the spectra is Uber.

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:21.250
Uber is an amazing,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.303
highly scalable new power model.

00:12:23.303 --> 00:12:25.329
That network is getting denser and denser

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.589
by the day.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:28.748
But what's really interesting 
about Uber is

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:32.489
it hasn't really adopted new power values.

00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:36.561
This is a real quote from 
the Uber CEO recently:

00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:41.009
He says, "Once we get rid of the dude 
in the car" — he means drivers —

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:44.901
"Uber will be cheaper."

00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:47.876
Now, new power models
live and die

00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:50.058
by the strength of their networks.

00:12:50.058 --> 00:12:51.991
By whether the drivers and the consumers

00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:54.332
who use the service actually believe in it.

00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:57.833
Because they're not an exercise 
of top-down perfectionism,

00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:59.781
they are about the network.

00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:01.477
And so, the challenge,

00:13:01.477 --> 00:13:03.727
and this is why it's in
no way surprising,

00:13:03.727 --> 00:13:07.983
is that Uber's drivers 
are now unionizing.

00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:09.583
It's extraordinary.

00:13:09.583 --> 00:13:11.872
Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.

00:13:11.872 --> 00:13:13.166
And the challenge for Uber —

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.093
this isn't an easy situation for them —

00:13:15.093 --> 00:13:18.389
is that they are locked into
a broader superstrcuture

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:20.074
that is really old power.

00:13:20.074 --> 00:13:23.082
They've raised more than a billion 
dollars in the capital markets.

00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:25.610
Those markets expect a financial return,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.527
and they way you get a financial return

00:13:27.527 --> 00:13:29.924
is by squeezing and squeezing

00:13:29.924 --> 00:13:32.169
your users and your drivers

00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:33.464
for more and more value

00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:35.931
and giving that value to your investors.

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:39.534
So the big question about the future 
of new power, in my view, is:

00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:42.093
Will that old power just emerge?

00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:43.876
So will new power elites just become

00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:45.765
old power and squeeze?

00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:48.378
Or will that new power
base bite back?

00:13:48.378 --> 00:13:50.139
Will the next big Uber

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:52.519
be co-owned by Uber drivers?

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:55.302
And I think this going 
to be a very interesting

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.204
structural question.

00:13:57.204 --> 00:14:00.486
Finally, think about new power

00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:02.853
being more than just an

00:14:02.853 --> 00:14:04.489
entity that scales things 

00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:08.205
that make us have slightly 
better consumer experiences.

00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:10.371
My call to action for new power

00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:12.779
is to not be an island.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.935
We have major structural
problems in the world today

00:14:15.935 --> 00:14:18.191
that could benefit enormously

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.505
from the kinds of mass participation

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:21.842
and peer coordination

00:14:21.842 --> 00:14:23.570
that these new power players

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.966
know so well how to generate.

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:29.479
And we badly need them to 
turn their energies and their power

00:14:29.479 --> 00:14:32.703
to big, what economists might call

00:14:32.703 --> 00:14:34.276
public goods problems,

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:36.322
that are often beyond markets

00:14:36.322 --> 00:14:38.332
where investors can easily be found.

00:14:38.332 --> 00:14:40.222
And I think if we can do that,

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:43.207
we might be able to fundamentally change

00:14:43.207 --> 00:14:46.738
not only human beings' sense of 
their own agency and power —

00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:49.596
because I think that's the most
wonderful thing about new power,

00:14:49.596 --> 00:14:52.348
is that people feel more powerful —

00:14:52.348 --> 00:14:54.129
but we might also be able to change

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:55.892
the way we relate to each other

00:14:55.892 --> 00:14:59.003
and the way we relate to 
authority and institutions.

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:01.051
And to me, that's absolutely

00:15:01.051 --> 00:15:02.622
worth trying for.

00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:03.718
Thank you very much.

00:15:03.718 --> 00:15:05.810
(Applause)
