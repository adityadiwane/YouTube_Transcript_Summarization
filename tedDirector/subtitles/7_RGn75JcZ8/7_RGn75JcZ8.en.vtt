00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.660
Twenty-eight years ago,
I was a broken man.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.460
And you probably wouldn't be able
to tell that if you met me.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.940
I had a good job at a well-respected
academic institution.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.940
I dressed well, of course.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.300
But my insides were rotting away.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.420
You see, I grew up in a family
riddled with addiction,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.920
and as a kid, I also struggled

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:38.716
with coming to terms
with my own sexuality.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.076
And even though I couldn't name it then,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.116
growing up as a gay kid

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.900
just compounded my issues
of isolation and insecurities.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.030
But drinking took all of that away.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.780
Like many, I drank at an early age.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.860
I continued to drink
my way through college.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.476
And when I finally did come out
in the early 1980s,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.316
about the only places
to meet other gay people,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.540
to socialize,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.020
to be yourself, were gay bars.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.660
And what do you do in gay bars?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.876
You drink.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.516
And I did --

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.740
a lot.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.940
My story is not unique.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.460
Like millions of Americans,
my disease progressed undiagnosed.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.196
It took me to people
and places and things

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.700
that I never would have chosen.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.836
It wasn't until
an intersection with the law

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.060
gave me an "opportunity" to get care,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.620
that I began my journey of recovery.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.820
My journey of recovery
has been filled with love and with joy,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.756
but it hasn't been without pain.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.756
Like many of you, I've lost too many
friends and family to this disease.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.716
I've heard too many
heartbreaking stories

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.900
of people who've lost
loved ones to addiction.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.940
And I've also lost
countless friends to HIV and AIDS.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.516
Our current opioid epidemic
and the AIDS epidemic

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.300
tragically have much in common.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
Right now, we are in the midst of one
of the greatest health crises of our time.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.436
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.900
died of drug overdoses associated
with prescription drugs and heroin.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.580
During the 1980s, scores of people
were dying from HIV and AIDS.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.260
Public officials ignored it.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.260
Some wouldn't even utter the words.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260
They didn't want treatment.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.380
And tragically, there are many parallels
with our current epidemic.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.180
Some called it the gay plague.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.900
They called for quarantines.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.380
They wanted to separate
the innocent victims from the rest of us.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.276
I was afraid we were losing this battle

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.260
because people were
blaming us for being sick.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.940
Public policy was being held hostage
by stigma and fear,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.956
and also held hostage

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.580
were compassion, care,
research, recovery and treatment.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.660
But we changed all that.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.876
Because out of the pain of those deaths,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.620
we saw a social and political movement.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.980
AIDS galvanized us into action;

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.980
to stand up, to speak up and to act out.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.580
And it also galvanized
the LGBT movement.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.276
We knew we were
in a battle for our lives

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.860
because silence equaled death,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
but we changed,
and we made things happen.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.876
And right now, we have the potential

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.900
to see the end of HIV/AIDS
in our lifetime.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.116
These changes came in no small part

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.260
by the courageous, yet simple decision

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.420
for people to come out

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.180
to their neighbors,
to their friends, to their families

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.500
and to their coworkers.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.220
Years ago, I was a volunteer
for the Names Project.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.396
This was an effort started
by Cleve Jones in San Francisco

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.396
to show that people who died of AIDS

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.620
had names

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.180
and faces and families

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.620
and people who loved them.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.779
I still recall unfolding
the AIDS memorial quilt

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.300
on the National Mall
on a brilliant day in October, 1988.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.940
So fast forward to 2015.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.580
The Supreme Court's decision to strike
down the ban on same-sex marriage.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.756
My husband, Dave, and I walk over
to the steps of the Supreme Court

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.716
to celebrate that decision
with so many other people,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.116
and I couldn't help but think
how far we came around LGBT rights

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.940
and yet how far we needed to go
around issues of addiction.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.796
When I was nominated
by President Obama

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.996
to be his Director of Drug Policy,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.660
I was very open about my recovery
and about the fact that I was a gay man.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.876
And at no point during
my confirmation process --

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.436
at least that I know of --

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.436
did the fact that I was a gay man
come to bear on my candidacy

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.260
or my fitness to do this job.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.780
But my addiction did.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.956
At one point, a congressional staffer
said that there was no way

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.836
that I was going to be confirmed
by the United States Senate

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.436
because of my past,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.876
despite the fact that I had been
in recovery for over 20 years,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.116
and despite the fact

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.116
that this job takes a little bit
of knowledge around addiction.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.620
(Laughter)

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.396
So, you know, this is the stigma

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.476
that people with
substance use disorders

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.900
face every single day,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.276
and you know, I have to tell you

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.756
it's still why I'm more comfortable
coming out as a gay man

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.300
than I am as a person
with a history of addiction.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.860
Nearly every family in America
is affected by addiction.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.100
Yet, unfortunately, too often,
it's not talked about openly and honestly.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.636
It's whispered about.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.020
It's met with derision and scorn.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.780
We hear these stories,
time and time again, on TV, online,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.020
we hear it from public officials,
and we hear it from family and friends.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.340
And those of us with an addiction,
we hear those voices,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.500
and somehow we believe that we are
less deserving of care and treatment.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.236
Today in the United States,
only one in nine people

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.796
get care and treatment for their disorder.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.396
One in nine.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.620
Think about that.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.476
Generally, people with other diseases
get care and treatment.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.476
If you have cancer, you get treatment,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.516
if you have diabetes, you get treatment.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.876
If you have a heart attack,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.600
you get emergency services,
and you get referred to care.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.236
But somehow people with addiction
have to wait for treatment

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.380
or often can't get when they need it.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.580
And left untreated, addiction
has significant, dire consequences.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.500
And for many people
that means death or incarceration.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.407
We've been down that road before.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.636
For too long our country felt

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.980
like we could arrest our way
out of this problem.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.980
But we know that we can't.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.876
Decades of scientific research has shown

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.036
that this is a medical issue --

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.636
that this is a chronic medical condition

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.540
that people inherit
and that people develop.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.220
So the Obama administration
has taken a different tack on drug policy.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.316
We've developed and implemented
a comprehensive plan

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.716
to expand prevention services,
treatment services,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.380
early intervention and recovery support.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.405
We've pushed criminal justice reform.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.180
We've knocked down barriers
to give people second chances.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.116
We see public health and public safety
officials working hand in hand

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.340
at the community level.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.476
We see police chiefs across the country
guiding people to treatment

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.140
instead of jail and incarceration.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.116
We see law enforcement
and other first responders

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.980
reversing overdoses with naloxone
to give people a second chance for care.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.116
The Affordable Care Act
is the biggest expansion

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.396
of substance use disorder
treatment in a generation,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.460
and it also calls for the integration
of treatment services within primary care.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.140
But fundamentally,
all of this work is not enough.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.676
Unless we change the way
that we view people with addiction

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.900
in the United States.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.796
Years ago when I finally
understood that I had a problem

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.955
and I knew that I needed help,

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.619
I was too afraid to ask for it.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.340
I felt that people would think
I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.070
that I was morally flawed.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.220
But I talk about my recovery
because I want to make change.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.996
I want us to see that we need to be open
and candid about who we are

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.220
and what we can do.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.516
I am public about my own recovery

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.460
not to be self-congratulatory.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.116
I am open about my own recovery
to change public opinion,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.036
to change public policy

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.956
and to change the course of this epidemic
and empower the millions of Americans

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.836
who struggle with this journey

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.820
to be open and candid
about who they are.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.780
People are more than their disease.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.996
And all of us have the opportunity
to change public opinion

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.660
and to change public policy.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.100
All of us know someone
who has an addiction,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.036
and all of us can do our part

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.220
to change how we view people
with addiction in the United States.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.636
So when you see
someone with an addiction,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:06.340
don't think of a drunk or a junkie
or an addict or an abuser --

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.700
see a person;

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.356
offer them help;

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.100
give them kindness and compassion.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.396
And together, we can be part

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.476
of a growing movement
in the United States

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.580
to change how we view
people with addiction.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.420
Together we can change public policy.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.156
We can ensure that people
get care when they need it,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.860
just like any other disease.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.556
We can be part of a growing,
unstoppable movement

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.596
to have millions of Americans
enter recovery,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.716
and put an end to this epidemic.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.956
Thank you very much.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.356
(Applause)
