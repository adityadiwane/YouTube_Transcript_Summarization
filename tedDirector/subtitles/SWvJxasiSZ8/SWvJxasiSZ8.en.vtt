00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is Revolution 2.0.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Because everyone was a hero.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Everyone has done something.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
We all use Wikipedia.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
where everyone is collaborating on content,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and at the end of the day

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
From just an idea that sounded crazy,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And in the Egyptian revolution,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
the Revolution 2.0,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
everyone has contributed something,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
small or big. They contributed something --

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
to bring us

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
one of the most inspiring stories

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in the history of mankind

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
when it comes to revolutions.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
It was actually really inspiring

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
to see all these Egyptians completely changing.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
If you look at the scene,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill --

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
going into a downhill.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Everything was going bad.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Everything was going wrong.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
We only ranked high when it comes to poverty,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
corruption,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
lack of freedom of speech,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
lack of political activism.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Those were the achievements

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
of our great regime.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Yet, nothing was happening.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And it's not because people were happy

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
or people were not frustrated.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
In fact, people were extremely frustrated.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But the reason why everyone was silent

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is what I call the psychological barrier of fear.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Everyone was scared.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
that I have to thank for being so brave --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
going into protests as a couple of hundred,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
getting beaten up and arrested.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But in fact, the majority were scared.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Everyone did not want really

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
to get in trouble.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
A dictator cannot live without the force.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
They want to make people live in fear.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And that psychological barrier of fear

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
had worked for so many years,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and here comes the Internet,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
technology, BlackBerry, SMS.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
It's helping all of us to connect.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
were helping us a lot

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
There are a lot of people who are frustrated."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
There are lots of people who are frustrated.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
There are lots of people who care about their freedom.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
They probably have the best life in the world.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
They are happy. They don't have problems.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
A lot of us, we're not really happy

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
when we see a video of an Egyptian man

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
who's eating the trash

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
while others are stealing

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
billions of Egyptian pounds

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
from the wealth of the country.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
The Internet has played a great role,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
helping these people to speak up their minds,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
to collaborate together, to start thinking together.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
It was an educational campaign.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Khaled Saeed was killed

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
in June 2010.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
I still remember the photo.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
I still remember every single detail of that photo.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
The photo was horrible.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
He was tortured,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
brutally tortured to death.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But then what was the answer of the regime?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
"He choked on a pile of hash" --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that was their answer:

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
"He's a criminal.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
He's someone who escaped from all these bad things."

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
But people did not relate to this.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
People did not believe this.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
and everyone knew the truth.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
He was a middle-class guy.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
His photo was remembered by all of us.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
A page was created.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
An anonymous administrator

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
was basically inviting people to join the page,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and there was no plan.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
In a few days, tens of thousands of people there --

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
angry Egyptians

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
who were asking the ministry of interior affairs,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
"Enough.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Get those who killed this guy.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
To just bring them to justice."

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
But of course, they don't listen.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It was an amazing story --

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
how everyone started feeling the ownership.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Everyone was an owner in this page.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
People started contributing ideas.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Let's get people to go in the street,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
face the sea, their back to the street,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
doing nothing and then just leaving,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
going back home."

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And next time it's going to be vibration."

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
People were making fun of the idea.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But actually when people went to the street --

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the first time it was thousands of people

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
in Alexandria --

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
because it connected people from the virtual world,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
bringing them to the real world,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
sharing the same dream,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
the same frustration, the same anger,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
the same desire for freedom.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And they were doing this thing.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
They were actually attacking them.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
They were actually abusing them,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
they were not even protesting.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And things had developed

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
until the Tunisian revolution.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This whole page was, again,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
managed by the people.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
In fact, the anonymous admin job

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
was to collect ideas,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
help people to vote on them

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and actually tell them what they are doing.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
People were taking shots and photos;

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
people were suggesting ideas,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
they were actually voting on ideas,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Everything was done by the people to the people,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and that's the power of the Internet.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
There was no leader.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
The leader was everyone on that page.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Yes we can. We can do it.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We have the same problems;

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
we can just go in the streets.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And when I saw the street on the 25th,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
I went back and said,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
"Egypt before the 25th

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
The revolution is happening.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
This is not the end,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
this is the beginning of the end."

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.260
I was detained on the 27th night.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Thank God I announced the locations and everything.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
But they detained me.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I was detained for 12 days,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
blindfolded, handcuffed.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I was not allowed to speak with anyone.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And I went out.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
The next day I was in Tahrir.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I thought it was 12 years.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I never had in my mind

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
to see this Egyptian,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
the amazing Egyptian.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
The fear is no longer fear.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
It's actually strength -- it's power.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
People were so empowered.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and now asking for their rights.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Completely opposite.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Extremism became tolerance.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them --

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
this is amazing.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
All the stereotypes

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
that the regime was trying to put on us

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
are proven wrong.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
This whole revolution showed us

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
how ugly such a regime was

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and how great and amazing

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
how simple and amazing these people are

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
whenever they have a dream.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
When I saw that,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
I went back and I wrote on Facebook.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And that was a personal belief,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
regardless of what's going on,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
regardless of the details.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I said that, "We are going to win.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
actually come from our hearts.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
We're going to win because we have dreams.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.260
We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And that's actually what happened. We won.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And that's not because of anything,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
but because we believed in our dream.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
The winning here is not

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
The winning is the winning of the dignity

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
of every single Egyptian.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
"Listen, I am breathing freedom.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
I feel that I have dignity

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that I have lost for so many years."

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
For me that's winning,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
regardless of all the details.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
My last word to you is a statement I believe in,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
which Egyptians have proven to be true,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
that the power of the people

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
is much stronger than the people in power.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Thanks a lot.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Applause)
